ACT I. Scene I.
Elsinore. A platform before the Castle.

Enter two Sentinels-[first,] Franc
isco, [who paces up and down
at his post; then] Bernardo, [who approaches him].

  Ber. Who's the
re?
  Fran. Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.
  Ber. Long live the King!
  Fran. Bernard
o?
  Ber. He.
  Fran. You come most carefully upon your hour.
  Ber. 'Tis now struck twelve. Get 
thee to bed, Francisco.
  Fran. For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold,
    And I am sick a
t heart.
  Ber. Have you had quiet guard?
  Fran. Not a mouse stirring.
  Ber. Well, good night.

    If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
    The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.

    
                Enter Horatio and Marcellus.

  Fran. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there
?
  Hor. Friends to this ground.
  Mar. And liegemen to the Dane.
  Fran. Give you good night.
 
 Mar. O, farewell, honest soldier.
    Who hath reliev'd you?
  Fran. Bernardo hath my place.
   
 Give you good night.                                   Exit.
  Mar. Holla, Bernardo!
  Ber. Say-

    What, is Horatio there ?
  Hor. A piece of him.
  Ber. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcel
lus.
  Mar. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
  Ber. I have seen nothing.
  Mar. Hora
tio says 'tis but our fantasy,
    And will not let belief take hold of him
    Touching this drea
ded sight, twice seen of us.
    Therefore I have entreated him along,
    With us to watch the mi
nutes of this night,
    That, if again this apparition come,
    He may approve our eyes and spea
k to it.
  Hor. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
  Ber. Sit down awhile,
    And let us once again 
assail your ears,
    That are so fortified against our story,
    What we two nights have seen.

  Hor. Well, sit we down,
    And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
  Ber. Last night of all,
 
   When yond same star that's westward from the pole
    Had made his course t' illume that part of
 heaven
    Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
    The bell then beating one-

          
              Enter Ghost.

  Mar. Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!
  Ber. In th
e same figure, like the King that's dead.
  Mar. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
  Ber. 
Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.
  Hor. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.

  Ber. It would be spoke to.
  Mar. Question it, Horatio.
  Hor. What art thou that usurp'st thi
s time of night
    Together with that fair and warlike form
    In which the majesty of buried De
nmark
    Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!
  Mar. It is offended.
  Ber. See, 
it stalks away!
  Hor. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!
                                  
                   Exit Ghost.
  Mar. 'Tis gone and will not answer.
  Ber. How now, Horatio? You 
tremble and look pale.
    Is not this something more than fantasy?
    What think you on't?
  Ho
r. Before my God, I might not this believe
    Without the sensible and true avouch
    Of mine ow
n eyes.
  Mar. Is it not like the King?
  Hor. As thou art to thyself.
    Such was the very armo
ur he had on
    When he th' ambitious Norway combated.
    So frown'd he once when, in an angry p
arle,
    He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
    'Tis strange.
  Mar. Thus twice before, an
d jump at this dead hour,
    With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
  Hor. In what particu
lar thought to work I know not;
    But, in the gross and scope of my opinion,
    This bodes some
 strange eruption to our state.
  Mar. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows,
    Why this
 same strict and most observant watch
    So nightly toils the subject of the land,
    And why su
ch daily cast of brazen cannon
    And foreign mart for implements of war;
    Why such impress of
 shipwrights, whose sore task
    Does not divide the Sunday from the week.
    What might be towa
rd, that this sweaty haste
    Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day?
    Who is't that 
can inform me?
  Hor. That can I.
    At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
    Whose ima
ge even but now appear'd to us,
    Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
    Thereto prick'd
 on by a most emulate pride,
    Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet
    (For so this
 side of our known world esteem'd him)
    Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,
   
 Well ratified by law and heraldry,
    Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
    Which 
he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror;
    Against the which a moiety competent
    Was gaged by ou
r king; which had return'd
    To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
    Had he been vanquisher, as, b
y the same cov'nant
    And carriage of the article design'd,
    His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, yo
ung Fortinbras,
    Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
    Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and 
there,
    Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
    For food and diet, to some enterprise
    
That hath a stomach in't; which is no other,
    As it doth well appear unto our state,
    But to
 recover of us, by strong hand
    And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
    So by his fath
er lost; and this, I take it,
    Is the main motive of our preparations,
    The source of this o
ur watch, and the chief head
    Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
  Ber. I think it be n
o other but e'en so.
    Well may it sort that this portentous figure
    Comes armed through our 
watch, so like the King
    That was and is the question of these wars.
  Hor. A mote it is to tro
uble the mind's eye.
    In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
    A little ere the mightiest 
Julius fell,
    The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead
    Did squeak and gibber in th
e Roman streets;
    As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood,
    Disasters in the sun; an
d the moist star
    Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
    Was sick almost to doomsday 
with eclipse.
    And even the like precurse of fierce events,
    As harbingers preceding still t
he fates
    And prologue to the omen coming on,
    Have heaven and earth together demonstrated

    Unto our climature and countrymen.

                      Enter Ghost again.

    But soft! 
behold! Lo, where it comes again!
    I'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!
         
                                      Spreads his arms.
    If thou hast any sound, or use of voice
,
    Speak to me.
    If there be any good thing to be done,
    That may to thee do ease, and, 
race to me,
    Speak to me.
    If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
    Which happily forek
nowing may avoid,
    O, speak!
    Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
    Extorted treasure i
n the womb of earth
    (For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death),
                    
                             The cock crows.
    Speak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!

  Mar. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
  Hor. Do, if it will not stand.
  Ber. 'Tis here!

  Hor. 'Tis here!
  Mar. 'Tis gone!
                                                     Exit Gh
ost.
    We do it wrong, being so majestical,
    To offer it the show of violence;
    For it is
 as the air, invulnerable,
    And our vain blows malicious mockery.
  Ber. It was about to speak,
 when the cock crew.
  Hor. And then it started, like a guilty thing
    Upon a fearful summons. I
 have heard
    The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
    Doth with his lofty and shrill-soun
ding throat
    Awake the god of day; and at his warning,
    Whether in sea or fire, in earth or 
air,
    Th' extravagant and erring spirit hies
    To his confine; and of the truth herein
    T
his present object made probation.
  Mar. It faded on the crowing of the cock.
    Some say that e
ver, 'gainst that season comes
    Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
    The bird of dawn
ing singeth all night long;
    And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,
    The nights are
 wholesome, then no planets strike,
    No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
    So hall
ow'd and so gracious is the time.
  Hor. So have I heard and do in part believe it.
    But look, 
the morn, in russet mantle clad,
    Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.
    Break we ou
r watch up; and by my advice
    Let us impart what we have seen to-night
    Unto young Hamlet; f
or, upon my life,
    This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
    Do you consent we shall acqu
aint him with it,
    As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
    Let's do't, I pray; and I thi
s morning know
    Where we shall find him most conveniently.           Exeunt.




Scene II.

Elsinore. A room of state in the Castle.

Flourish. [Enter Claudius, King of Denmark, Gertrude th
e Queen,
Hamlet,
Polonius, Laertes and his sister Ophelia, [Voltemand, Cornelius,]
Lords Attendan
t.

  King. Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
    The memory be green, and that it us
 befitted
    To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom
    To be contracted in one brow 
of woe,
    Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
    That we with wisest sorrow think on 
him
    Together with remembrance of ourselves.
    Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,

    Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,
    Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,
   
 With an auspicious, and a dropping eye,
    With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,
  
  In equal scale weighing delight and dole,
    Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd
    Your 
better wisdoms, which have freely gone
    With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
    Now fo
llows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
    Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
    Or thinking 
by our late dear brother's death
    Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
    Colleagued wit
h this dream of his advantage,
    He hath not fail'd to pester us with message
    Importing the 
surrender of those lands
    Lost by his father, with all bands of law,
    To our most valiant br
other. So much for him.
    Now for ourself and for this time of meeting.
    Thus much the busine
ss is: we have here writ
    To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,
    Who, impotent and bedrid, s
carcely hears
    Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress
    His further gait herein, in that t
he levies,
    The lists, and full proportions are all made
    Out of his subject; and we here di
spatch
    You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,
    For bearers of this greeting to old Norway
,
    Giving to you no further personal power
    To business with the King, more than the scope

    Of these dilated articles allow.            [Gives a paper.]
    Farewell, and let your haste c
ommend your duty.
  Cor., Volt. In that, and all things, will we show our duty.
  King. We doubt i
t nothing. Heartily farewell.
                                 Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius.
   
 And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
    You told us of some suit. What is't, Laertes?
   
 You cannot speak of reason to the Dane
    And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
 
   That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
    The head is not more native to the heart,
    T
he hand more instrumental to the mouth,
    Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
    What 
wouldst thou have, Laertes?
  Laer. My dread lord,
    Your leave and favour to return to France;

    From whence though willingly I came to Denmark
    To show my duty in your coronation,
    Ye
t now I must confess, that duty done,
    My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
    And 
bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
  King. Have you your father's leave? What says Poloniu
s?
  Pol. He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
    By laboursome petition, and at last
 
   Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent.
    I do beseech you give him leave to go.
  King. Take
 thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,
    And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
    But now,
 my cousin Hamlet, and my son-
  Ham. [aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind!
  King. 
How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
  Ham. Not so, my lord. I am too much i' th' sun.
  Q
ueen. Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
    And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark
.
    Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
    Seek for thy noble father in the dust.
    Thou kn
ow'st 'tis common. All that lives must die,
    Passing through nature to eternity.
  Ham. Ay, mad
am, it is common.
  Queen. If it be,
    Why seems it so particular with thee?
  Ham. Seems, mada
m, Nay, it is. I know not 'seems.'
    'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
    Nor customar
y suits of solemn black,
    Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,
    No, nor the fruitful rive
r in the eye,
    Nor the dejected havior of the visage,
    Together with all forms, moods, shape
s of grief,
    'That can denote me truly. These indeed seem,
    For they are actions that a man 
might play;
    But I have that within which passeth show-
    These but the trappings and the sui
ts of woe.
  King. 'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
    To give these mourning d
uties to your father;
    But you must know, your father lost a father;
    That father lost, lost
 his, and the survivor bound
    In filial obligation for some term
    To do obsequious sorrow. B
ut to persever
    In obstinate condolement is a course
    Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly 
grief;
    It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
    A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
 
   An understanding simple and unschool'd;
    For what we know must be, and is as common
    As a
ny the most vulgar thing to sense,
    Why should we in our peevish opposition
    Take it to hear
t? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
    A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
    To reason mos
t absurd, whose common theme
    Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
    From the first
 corse till he that died to-day,
    'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth
    This unprev
ailing woe, and think of us
    As of a father; for let the world take note
    You are the most i
mmediate to our throne,
    And with no less nobility of love
    Than that which dearest father b
ears his son
    Do I impart toward you. For your intent
    In going back to school in Wittenberg
,
    It is most retrograde to our desire;
    And we beseech you, bend you to remain
    Here in
 the cheer and comfort of our eye,
    Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
  Queen. Let no
t thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.
    I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.
  Ham. 
I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
  King. Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.
    Be as our
self in Denmark. Madam, come.
    This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet
    Sits smiling to my
 heart; in grace whereof,
    No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day
    But the great cannon
 to the clouds shall tell,
    And the King's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,
    Respeaking e
arthly thunder. Come away.
                                Flourish. Exeunt all but Hamlet.
  Ham.
 O that this too too solid flesh would melt,
    Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!
    Or that 
the Everlasting had not fix'd
    His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
    How weary, sta
le, flat, and unprofitable
    Seem to me all the uses of this world!
    Fie on't! ah, fie! 'Tis 
an unweeded garden
    That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
    Possess it merely. 
That it should come to this!
    But two months dead! Nay, not so much, not two.
    So excellent 
a king, that was to this
    Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
    That he might not bet
eem the winds of heaven
    Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
    Must I remember? Why
, she would hang on him
    As if increase of appetite had grown
    By what it fed on; and yet, w
ithin a month-
    Let me not think on't! Frailty, thy name is woman!-
    A little month, or ere 
those shoes were old
    With which she followed my poor father's body
    Like Niobe, all tears- 
why she, even she
    (O God! a beast that wants discourse of reason
    Would have mourn'd longer
) married with my uncle;
    My father's brother, but no more like my father
    Than I to Hercule
s. Within a month,
    Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
    Had left the flushing in her
 galled eyes,
    She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
    With such dexterity to incestuous
 sheets!
    It is not, nor it cannot come to good.
    But break my heart, for I must hold my ton
gue!

          Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo.

  Hor. Hail to your lordship!
  Ham. I
 am glad to see you well.
    Horatio!- or I do forget myself.
  Hor. The same, my lord, and your 
poor servant ever.
  Ham. Sir, my good friend- I'll change that name with you.
    And what make y
ou from Wittenberg, Horatio?
    Marcellus?
  Mar. My good lord!
  Ham. I am very glad to see you
.- [To Bernardo] Good even, sir.-

    But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
  Hor. A tru
ant disposition, good my lord.
  Ham. I would not hear your enemy say so,
    Nor shall you do my 
ear that violence
    To make it truster of your own report
    Against yourself. I know you are n
o truant.
    But what is your affair in Elsinore?
    We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depar
t.
  Hor. My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
  Ham. I prithee do not mock me, fellow st
udent.
    I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
  Hor. Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upo
n.
  Ham. Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats
    Did coldly furnish forth the marria
ge tables.
    Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
    Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!

    My father- methinks I see my father.
  Hor. O, where, my lord?
  Ham. In my mind's eye, Horat
io.
  Hor. I saw him once. He was a goodly king.
  Ham. He was a man, take him for all in all.
  
  I shall not look upon his like again.
  Hor. My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
  Ham. Saw?
 who?
  Hor. My lord, the King your father.
  Ham. The King my father?
  Hor. Season your admirat
ion for a while
    With an attent ear, till I may deliver
    Upon the witness of these gentlemen
,
    This marvel to you.
  Ham. For God's love let me hear!
  Hor. Two nights together had these
 gentlemen
    (Marcellus and Bernardo) on their watch
    In the dead vast and middle of the nigh
t
    Been thus encount'red. A figure like your father,
    Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
   
 Appears before them and with solemn march
    Goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walk'd
   
 By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
    Within his truncheon's length; whilst they distill
'd
    Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
    Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
    
In dreadful secrecy impart they did,
    And I with them the third night kept the watch;
    Where
, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
    Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
    Th
e apparition comes. I knew your father.
    These hands are not more like.
  Ham. But where was th
is?
  Mar. My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
  Ham. Did you not speak to it?
  Hor. My
 lord, I did;
    But answer made it none. Yet once methought
    It lifted up it head and did add
ress
    Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
    But even then the morning cock crew loud,

    And at the sound it shrunk in haste away
    And vanish'd from our sight.
  Ham. 'Tis very str
ange.
  Hor. As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
    And we did think it writ down in our d
uty
    To let you know of it.
  Ham. Indeed, indeed, sirs. But this troubles me.
    Hold you th
e watch to-night?
  Both [Mar. and Ber.] We do, my lord.
  Ham. Arm'd, say you?
  Both. Arm'd, my
 lord.
  Ham. From top to toe?
  Both. My lord, from head to foot.
  Ham. Then saw you not his fa
ce?
  Hor. O, yes, my lord! He wore his beaver up.
  Ham. What, look'd he frowningly.
  Hor. A co
untenance more in sorrow than in anger.
  Ham. Pale or red?
  Hor. Nay, very pale.
  Ham. And fix
'd his eyes upon you?
  Hor. Most constantly.
  Ham. I would I had been there.
  Hor. It would ha
ve much amaz'd you.
  Ham. Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
  Hor. While one with moderate ha
ste might tell a hundred.
  Both. Longer, longer.
  Hor. Not when I saw't.
  Ham. His beard was g
rizzled- no?
  Hor. It was, as I have seen it in his life,
    A sable silver'd.
  Ham. I will wa
tch to-night.
    Perchance 'twill walk again.
  Hor. I warr'nt it will.
  Ham. If it assume my n
oble father's person,
    I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
    And bid me hold my 
peace. I pray you all,
    If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
    Let it be tenable in you
r silence still;
    And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
    Give it an understanding but no t
ongue.
    I will requite your loves. So, fare you well.
    Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and 
twelve,
    I'll visit you.
  All. Our duty to your honour.
  Ham. Your loves, as mine to you. Fa
rewell.
                                        Exeunt [all but Hamlet].
    My father's spirit- i
n arms? All is not well.
    I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come!
    Till then sit 
still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,
    Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
Exit
.




Scene III.
Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius.

Enter Laertes and Ophelia.

 
 Laer. My necessaries are embark'd. Farewell.
    And, sister, as the winds give benefit
    And c
onvoy is assistant, do not sleep,
    But let me hear from you.
  Oph. Do you doubt that?
  Laer.
 For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,
    Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood;
    A viol
et in the youth of primy nature,
    Forward, not permanent- sweet, not lasting;
    The perfume a
nd suppliance of a minute;
    No more.
  Oph. No more but so?
  Laer. Think it no more.
    For
 nature crescent does not grow alone
    In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,
    The inwa
rd service of the mind and soul
    Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
    And now no so
il nor cautel doth besmirch
    The virtue of his will; but you must fear,
    His greatness weigh
'd, his will is not his own;
    For he himself is subject to his birth.
    He may not, as unvalu
ed persons do,
    Carve for himself, for on his choice depends
    The safety and health of this 
whole state,
    And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd
    Unto the voice and yielding of
 that body
    Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
    It fits your wisdom so fa
r to believe it
    As he in his particular act and place
    May give his saying deed; which is n
o further
    Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
    Then weigh what loss your honour may
 sustain
    If with too credent ear you list his songs,
    Or lose your heart, or your chaste tr
easure open
    To his unmast'red importunity.
    Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
   
 And keep you in the rear of your affection,
    Out of the shot and danger of desire.
    The cha
riest maid is prodigal enough
    If she unmask her beauty to the moon.
    Virtue itself scopes n
ot calumnious strokes.
    The canker galls the infants of the spring
    Too oft before their but
tons be disclos'd,
    And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
    Contagious blastments are most 
imminent.
    Be wary then; best safety lies in fear.
    Youth to itself rebels, though none else
 near.
  Oph. I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep
    As watchman to my heart. But, good m
y brother,
    Do not as some ungracious pastors do,
    Show me the steep and thorny way to heave
n,
    Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
    Himself the primrose path of dalliance tr
eads
    And recks not his own rede.
  Laer. O, fear me not!

                       Enter Polon
ius.

    I stay too long. But here my father comes.
    A double blessing is a double grace;
  
  Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
  Pol. Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame!
    Th
e wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
    And you are stay'd for. There- my blessing with thee!

    And these few precepts in thy memory
    Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
 
   Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.
    Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar:
    Those
 friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
    Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel;

    But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
    Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware

    Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,
    Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee.
    G
ive every man thine ear, but few thy voice;
    Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.

    Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
    But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
    F
or the apparel oft proclaims the man,
    And they in France of the best rank and station
    Are 
most select and generous, chief in that.
    Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
    For loan oft 
loses both itself and friend,
    And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
    This above all- t
o thine own self be true,
    And it must follow, as the night the day,
    Thou canst not then be
 false to any man.
    Farewell. My blessing season this in thee!
  Laer. Most humbly do I take my
 leave, my lord.
  Pol. The time invites you. Go, your servants tend.
  Laer. Farewell, Ophelia, a
nd remember well
    What I have said to you.
  Oph. 'Tis in my memory lock'd,
    And you yourse
lf shall keep the key of it.
  Laer. Farewell.                                          Exit.
  Po
l. What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?
  Oph. So please you, something touching the Lord Hamle
t.
  Pol. Marry, well bethought!
    'Tis told me he hath very oft of late
    Given private time
 to you, and you yourself
    Have of your audience been most free and bounteous.
    If it be so-
 as so 'tis put on me,
    And that in way of caution- I must tell you
    You do not understand y
ourself so clearly
    As it behooves my daughter and your honour.
    What is between you? Give m
e up the truth.
  Oph. He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
    Of his affection to me.
  
Pol. Affection? Pooh! You speak like a green girl,
    Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
   
 Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
  Oph. I do not know, my lord, what I should think,

  Pol. Marry, I will teach you! Think yourself a baby
    That you have ta'en these tenders for tr
ue pay,
    Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,
    Or (not to crack the wind of 
the poor phrase,
    Running it thus) you'll tender me a fool.
  Oph. My lord, he hath importun'd 
me with love
    In honourable fashion.
  Pol. Ay, fashion you may call it. Go to, go to!
  Oph. 
And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
    With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
  
Pol. Ay, springes to catch woodcocks! I do know,
    When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
 
   Lends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter,
    Giving more light than heat, extinct in both

    Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
    You must not take for fire. From this time
    
Be something scanter of your maiden presence.
    Set your entreatments at a higher rate
    Than 
a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
    Believe so much in him, that he is young,
    And with a
 larger tether may he walk
    Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia,
    Do not believe his vows
; for they are brokers,
    Not of that dye which their investments show,
    But mere implorators
 of unholy suits,
    Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
    The better to beguile. This i
s for all:
    I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth
    Have you so slander any momen
t leisure
    As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
    Look to't, I charge you. Come you
r ways.
  Oph. I shall obey, my lord.
                                                         Exe
unt.




Scene IV.
Elsinore. The platform before the Castle.

Enter Hamlet, Horatio, and Mar
cellus.

  Ham. The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
  Hor. It is a nipping and an eager air.

  Ham. What hour now?
  Hor. I think it lacks of twelve.
  Mar. No, it is struck.
  Hor. Indeed
? I heard it not. It then draws near the season
    Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
    
               A flourish of trumpets, and two pieces go off.
    What does this mean, my lord?
  
Ham. The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
    Keeps wassail, and the swagg'ring upsprin
g reels,
    And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
    The kettledrum and trumpet thus b
ray out
    The triumph of his pledge.
  Hor. Is it a custom?
  Ham. Ay, marry, is't;
    But to
 my mind, though I am native here
    And to the manner born, it is a custom
    More honour'd in 
the breach than the observance.
    This heavy-headed revel east and west
    Makes us traduc'd an
d tax'd of other nations;
    They clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase
    Soil our addition
; and indeed it takes
    From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
    The pith and marr
ow of our attribute.
    So oft it chances in particular men
    That, for some vicious mole of na
ture in them,
    As in their birth,- wherein they are not guilty,
    Since nature cannot choose 
his origin,-
    By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
    Oft breaking down the pales and forts o
f reason,
    Or by some habit that too much o'erleavens
    The form of plausive manners, that th
ese men
    Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
    Being nature's livery, or fortune's star
,
    Their virtues else- be they as pure as grace,
    As infinite as man may undergo-
    Shall
 in the general censure take corruption
    From that particular fault. The dram of e'il
    Doth 
all the noble substance often dout To his own scandal.

                         Enter Ghost.

 
 Hor. Look, my lord, it comes!
  Ham. Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
    Be thou a spiri
t of health or goblin damn'd,
    Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
    Be thy
 intents wicked or charitable,
    Thou com'st in such a questionable shape
    That I will speak 
to thee. I'll call thee Hamlet,
    King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me?
    Let me not burst i
n ignorance, but tell
    Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,
    Have burst their cerement
s; why the sepulchre
    Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
    Hath op'd his ponderous and marb
le jaws
    To cast thee up again. What may this mean
    That thou, dead corse, again in complete
 steel,
    Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
    Making night hideous, and we fools of natu
re
    So horridly to shake our disposition
    With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
  
  Say, why is this? wherefore? What should we do?
                                           Ghost 
beckons Hamlet.
  Hor. It beckons you to go away with it,
    As if it some impartment did desire

    To you alone.
  Mar. Look with what courteous action
    It waves you to a more removed groun
d.
    But do not go with it!
  Hor. No, by no means!
  Ham. It will not speak. Then will I follo
w it.
  Hor. Do not, my lord!
  Ham. Why, what should be the fear?
    I do not set my life at a 
pin's fee;
    And for my soul, what can it do to that,
    Being a thing immortal as itself?
   
 It waves me forth again. I'll follow it.
  Hor. What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
 
   Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
    That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
    And the
re assume some other, horrible form
    Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
    And dra
w you into madness? Think of it.
    The very place puts toys of desperation,
    Without more mot
ive, into every brain
    That looks so many fadoms to the sea
    And hears it roar beneath.
  H
am. It waves me still.
    Go on. I'll follow thee.
  Mar. You shall not go, my lord.
  Ham. Hold
 off your hands!
  Hor. Be rul'd. You shall not go.
  Ham. My fate cries out
    And makes each p
etty artire in this body
    As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
                                
                [Ghost beckons.]

    Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
    By heaven, I'l
l make a ghost of him that lets me!-
    I say, away!- Go on. I'll follow thee.
                  
                      Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet.
  Hor. He waxes desperate with imagination.
  Mar. 
Let's follow. 'Tis not fit thus to obey him.
  Hor. Have after. To what issue will this come?
  Ma
r. Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
  Hor. Heaven will direct it.
  Mar. Nay, let's fo
llow him.
                                                         Exeunt.




Scene V.
Elsin
ore. The Castle. Another part of the fortifications.

Enter Ghost and Hamlet.

  Ham. Whither wi
lt thou lead me? Speak! I'll go no further.
  Ghost. Mark me.
  Ham. I will.
  Ghost. My hour is 
almost come,
    When I to sulph'rous and tormenting flames
    Must render up myself.
  Ham. Ala
s, poor ghost!
  Ghost. Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
    To what I shall unfold.
  H
am. Speak. I am bound to hear.
  Ghost. So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
  Ham. What?

  Ghost. I am thy father's spirit,
    Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
    And for 
the day confin'd to fast in fires,
    Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
    Are burn
t and purg'd away. But that I am forbid
    To tell the secrets of my prison house,
    I could a 
tale unfold whose lightest word
    Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
    Make thy
 two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
    Thy knotted and combined locks to part,
    A
nd each particular hair to stand on end
    Like quills upon the fretful porcupine.
    But this e
ternal blazon must not be
    To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
    If thou didst e
ver thy dear father love-
  Ham. O God!
  Ghost. Revenge his foul and most unnatural murther.
  H
am. Murther?
  Ghost. Murther most foul, as in the best it is;
    But this most foul, strange, an
d unnatural.
  Ham. Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
    As meditation or the thoug
hts of love,
    May sweep to my revenge.
  Ghost. I find thee apt;
    And duller shouldst thou 
be than the fat weed
    That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
    Wouldst thou not stir in thi
s. Now, Hamlet, hear.
    'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
    A serpent stung me. So 
the whole ear of Denmark
    Is by a forged process of my death
    Rankly abus'd. But know, thou 
noble youth,
    The serpent that did sting thy father's life
    Now wears his crown.
  Ham. O m
y prophetic soul!
    My uncle?
  Ghost. Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
    With wit
chcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts-
    O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
    So 
to seduce!- won to his shameful lust
    The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.
    O Hamlet,
 what a falling-off was there,
    From me, whose love was of that dignity
    That it went hand i
n hand even with the vow
    I made to her in marriage, and to decline
    Upon a wretch whose nat
ural gifts were poor
    To those of mine!
    But virtue, as it never will be mov'd,
    Though 
lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
    So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
    Will sa
te itself in a celestial bed
    And prey on garbage.
    But soft! methinks I scent the morning a
ir.
    Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
    My custom always of the afternoon,
    U
pon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
    With juice of cursed hebona in a vial,
    And in the porc
hes of my ears did pour
    The leperous distilment; whose effect
    Holds such an enmity with bl
ood of man
    That swift as quicksilver it courses through
    The natural gates and alleys of th
e body,
    And with a sudden vigour it doth posset
    And curd, like eager droppings into milk,

    The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine;
    And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
   
 Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust
    All my smooth body.
    Thus was I, sleeping, 
by a brother's hand
    Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd;
    Cut off even in the b
lossoms of my sin,
    Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd,
    No reckoning made, but sent to my a
ccount
    With all my imperfections on my head.
  Ham. O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!

  Ghost. If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.
    Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
    A c
ouch for luxury and damned incest.
    But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
    Taint not thy mi
nd, nor let thy soul contrive
    Against thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven,
    And to those 
thorns that in her bosom lodge
    To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once.
    The glowwor
m shows the matin to be near
    And gins to pale his uneffectual fire.
    Adieu, adieu, adieu! R
emember me.                      Exit.

  Ham. O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?
    
And shall I couple hell? Hold, hold, my heart!
    And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
    B
ut bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?
    Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
    In th
is distracted globe. Remember thee?
    Yea, from the table of my memory
    I'll wipe away all tr
ivial fond records,
    All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past
    That youth and observ
ation copied there,
    And thy commandment all alone shall live
    Within the book and volume of
 my brain,
    Unmix'd with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!
    O most pernicious woman!
    O vill
ain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
    My tables! Meet it is I set it down
    That one may sm
ile, and smile, and be a villain;
    At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark.        [Writes.]

    So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word:
    It is 'Adieu, adieu! Remember me.'
    I have s
worn't.
  Hor. (within) My lord, my lord!

                   Enter Horatio and Marcellus.

  M
ar. Lord Hamlet!
  Hor. Heaven secure him!
  Ham. So be it!
  Mar. Illo, ho, ho, my lord!
  Ham.
 Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.
  Mar. How is't, my noble lord?
  Hor. What news, my lord?

  Mar. O, wonderful!
  Hor. Good my lord, tell it.
  Ham. No, you will reveal it.
  Hor. Not I, 
my lord, by heaven!
  Mar. Nor I, my lord.
  Ham. How say you then? Would heart of man once think 
it?
    But you'll be secret?
  Both. Ay, by heaven, my lord.
  Ham. There's neer a villain dwell
ing in all Denmark
    But he's an arrant knave.
  Hor. There needs no ghost, my lord, come from t
he grave
    To tell us this.
  Ham. Why, right! You are in the right!
    And so, without more c
ircumstance at all,
    I hold it fit that we shake hands and part;
    You, as your business and 
desires shall point you,
    For every man hath business and desire,
    Such as it is; and for my
 own poor part,
    Look you, I'll go pray.
  Hor. These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.

  Ham. I am sorry they offend you, heartily;
    Yes, faith, heartily.
  Hor. There's no offence
, my lord.
  Ham. Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
    And much offence too. Touching
 this vision here,
    It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.
    For your desire to know wh
at is between us,
    O'ermaster't as you may. And now, good friends,
    As you are friends, scho
lars, and soldiers,
    Give me one poor request.
  Hor. What is't, my lord? We will.
  Ham. Neve
r make known what you have seen to-night.
  Both. My lord, we will not.
  Ham. Nay, but swear't.

  Hor. In faith,
    My lord, not I.
  Mar. Nor I, my lord- in faith.
  Ham. Upon my sword.
  Ma
r. We have sworn, my lord, already.
  Ham. Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.

                 Ghost
 cries under the stage.

  Ghost. Swear.
  Ham. Aha boy, say'st thou so? Art thou there, truepenn
y?
    Come on! You hear this fellow in the cellarage.
    Consent to swear.
  Hor. Propose the o
ath, my lord.
  Ham. Never to speak of this that you have seen.
    Swear by my sword.
  Ghost. [
beneath] Swear.
  Ham. Hic et ubique? Then we'll shift our ground.
    Come hither, gentlemen,
  
  And lay your hands again upon my sword.
    Never to speak of this that you have heard:
    Swea
r by my sword.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear by his sword.
  Ham. Well said, old mole! Canst work i' th
' earth so fast?
    A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends."
  Hor. O day and night, but
 this is wondrous strange!
  Ham. And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
    There are more 
things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
    Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
    But come!
   
 Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
    How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself
    (As I 
perchance hereafter shall think meet
    To put an antic disposition on),
    That you, at such ti
mes seeing me, never shall,
    With arms encumb'red thus, or this head-shake,
    Or by pronounci
ng of some doubtful phrase,
    As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'
    Or 'I
f we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'
    Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
  
  That you know aught of me- this is not to do,
    So grace and mercy at your most need help you,

    Swear.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
                                                   [They swe
ar.]
  Ham. Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! So, gentlemen,
    With all my love I do commend me to y
ou;
    And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
    May do t' express his love and friending to you,

    God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;
    And still your fingers on your lips, I 
pray.
    The time is out of joint. O cursed spite
    That ever I was born to set it right!
    
Nay, come, let's go together.
                                                         Exeunt.

Act II. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius.

Enter Polonius and 
Reynaldo.

  Pol. Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
  Rey. I will, my lord.
  Pol. 
You shall do marvell's wisely, good Reynaldo,
    Before You visit him, to make inquire
    Of his
 behaviour.
  Rey. My lord, I did intend it.
  Pol. Marry, well said, very well said. Look you, si
r,
    Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
    And how, and who, what means, and where th
ey keep,
    What company, at what expense; and finding
    By this encompassment and drift of que
stion
    That they do know my son, come you more nearer
    Than your particular demands will tou
ch it.
    Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
    As thus, 'I know his father and
 his friends,
    And in part him.' Do you mark this, Reynaldo?
  Rey. Ay, very well, my lord.
  
Pol. 'And in part him, but,' you may say, 'not well.
    But if't be he I mean, he's very wild
   
 Addicted so and so'; and there put on him
    What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
    
As may dishonour him- take heed of that;
    But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips
    As a
re companions noted and most known
    To youth and liberty.
  Rey. As gaming, my lord.
  Pol. Ay
, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
    Drabbing. You may go so far.
  Rey. My lord, th
at would dishonour him.
  Pol. Faith, no, as you may season it in the charge.
    You must not put
 another scandal on him,
    That he is open to incontinency.
    That's not my meaning. But breat
he his faults so quaintly
    That they may seem the taints of liberty,
    The flash and outbreak
 of a fiery mind,
    A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
    Of general assault.
  Rey. But, my g
ood lord-
  Pol. Wherefore should you do this?
  Rey. Ay, my lord,
    I would know that.
  Pol.
 Marry, sir, here's my drift,
    And I believe it is a fetch of warrant.
    You laying these sli
ght sullies on my son
    As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' th' working,
    Mark you,
    You
r party in converse, him you would sound,
    Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
    The y
outh you breathe of guilty, be assur'd
    He closes with you in this consequence:
    'Good sir,'
 or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman'-
    According to the phrase or the addition
    Of man and co
untry-
  Rey. Very good, my lord.
  Pol. And then, sir, does 'a this- 'a does- What was I about to

say?
    By the mass, I was about to say something! Where did I leave?
  Rey. At 'closes in the 
consequence,' at 'friend or so,' and
    gentleman.'
  Pol. At 'closes in the consequence'- Ay, ma
rry!
    He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman.
    I saw him yesterday, or t'other day,
    Or t
hen, or then, with such or such; and, as you say,
    There was 'a gaming; there o'ertook in's rous
e;
    There falling out at tennis'; or perchance,
    'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'
  
  Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
    See you now-
    Your bait of falsehood takes this carp o
f truth;
    And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
    With windlasses and with assays of bias,

    By indirections find directions out.
    So, by my former lecture and advice,
    Shall you my
 son. You have me, have you not?
  Rey. My lord, I have.
  Pol. God b' wi' ye, fare ye well!
  Re
y. Good my lord!                                    [Going.]
  Pol. Observe his inclination in your
self.
  Rey. I shall, my lord.
  Pol. And let him ply his music.
  Rey. Well, my lord.
  Pol. Fa
rewell!
                                                  Exit Reynaldo.

                       
Enter Ophelia.

    How now, Ophelia? What's the matter?
  Oph. O my lord, my lord, I have been s
o affrighted!
  Pol. With what, i' th' name of God?
  Oph. My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,

    Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac'd,
    No hat upon his head, his stockings foul'd,
 
   Ungart'red, and down-gyved to his ankle;
    Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,

    And with a look so piteous in purport
    As if he had been loosed out of hell
    To speak of
 horrors- he comes before me.
  Pol. Mad for thy love?
  Oph. My lord, I do not know,
    But tru
ly I do fear it.
  Pol. What said he?
  Oph. He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
    Then g
oes he to the length of all his arm,
    And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
    He falls
 to such perusal of my face
    As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so.
    At last, a little shak
ing of mine arm,
    And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
    He rais'd a sigh so piteous 
and profound
    As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
    And end his being. That done, he lets 
me go,
    And with his head over his shoulder turn'd
    He seem'd to find his way without his ey
es,
    For out o' doors he went without their help
    And to the last bended their light on me.

  Pol. Come, go with me. I will go seek the King.
    This is the very ecstasy of love,
    Whose
 violent property fordoes itself
    And leads the will to desperate undertakings
    As oft as an
y passion under heaven
    That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
    What, have you given him
 any hard words of late?
  Oph. No, my good lord; but, as you did command,
    I did repel his let
ters and denied
    His access to me.
  Pol. That hath made him mad.
    I am sorry that with bet
ter heed and judgment
    I had not quoted him. I fear'd he did but trifle
    And meant to wrack 
thee; but beshrew my jealousy!
    By heaven, it is as proper to our age
    To cast beyond oursel
ves in our opinions
    As it is common for the younger sort
    To lack discretion. Come, go we t
o the King.
    This must be known; which, being kept close, might move
    More grief to hide tha
n hate to utter love.
    Come.
                                                         Exeunt.


Scene II.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Flourish. [Enter King and Queen, Rosencrantz and Gui
ldenstern,
cum aliis.

  King. Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
    Moreover that we 
much did long to see you,
    The need we have to use you did provoke
    Our hasty sending. Somet
hing have you heard
    Of Hamlet's transformation. So I call it,
    Sith nor th' exterior nor th
e inward man
    Resembles that it was. What it should be,
    More than his father's death, that 
thus hath put him
    So much from th' understanding of himself,
    I cannot dream of. I entreat 
you both
    That, being of so young days brought up with him,
    And since so neighbour'd to his
 youth and haviour,
    That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
    Some little time; so by
 your companies
    To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather
    So much as from occasion you ma
y glean,
    Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus
    That, open'd, lies within our remed
y.
  Queen. Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,
    And sure I am two men there are not li
ving
    To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
    To show us so much gentry and good wil
l
    As to expend your time with us awhile
    For the supply and profit of our hope,
    Your v
isitation shall receive such thanks
    As fits a king's remembrance.
  Ros. Both your Majesties

    Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
    Put your dread pleasures more into command
 
   Than to entreaty.
  Guil. But we both obey,
    And here give up ourselves, in the full bent,

    To lay our service freely at your feet,
    To be commanded.
  King. Thanks, Rosencrantz and g
entle Guildenstern.
  Queen. Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz.
    And I beseech you in
stantly to visit
    My too much changed son.- Go, some of you,
    And bring these gentlemen wher
e Hamlet is.
  Guil. Heavens make our presence and our practices
    Pleasant and helpful to him!

  Queen. Ay, amen!
                 Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, [with some
             
                                       Attendants].

                         Enter Polonius.

 
 Pol. Th' ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
    Are joyfully return'd.
  King. Thou still has
t been the father of good news.
  Pol. Have I, my lord? Assure you, my good liege,
    I hold my d
uty as I hold my soul,
    Both to my God and to my gracious king;
    And I do think- or else thi
s brain of mine
    Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
    As it hath us'd to do- that I have f
ound
    The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
  King. O, speak of that! That do I long to hear.
  P
ol. Give first admittance to th' ambassadors.
    My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.

  King. Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
                                              
  [Exit Polonius.]
    He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found
    The head and source of all
 your son's distemper.
  Queen. I doubt it is no other but the main,
    His father's death and ou
r o'erhasty marriage.
  King. Well, we shall sift him.

              Enter Polonius, Voltemand, 
and Cornelius.

    Welcome, my good friends.
    Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?

  Volt. Most fair return of greetings and desires.
    Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
   
 His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
    To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack,
    But be
tter look'd into, he truly found
    It was against your Highness; whereat griev'd,
    That so hi
s sickness, age, and impotence
    Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
    On Fortinbras;
 which he, in brief, obeys,
    Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,
    Makes vow before hi
s uncle never more
    To give th' assay of arms against your Majesty.
    Whereon old Norway, ove
rcome with joy,
    Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee
    And his commission to employ
 those soldiers,
    So levied as before, against the Polack;
    With an entreaty, herein further
 shown,
                                                [Gives a paper.]
    That it might please 
you to give quiet pass
    Through your dominions for this enterprise,
    On such regards of safe
ty and allowance
    As therein are set down.
  King. It likes us well;
    And at our more consi
der'd time we'll read,
    Answer, and think upon this business.
    Meantime we thank you for you
r well-took labour.
    Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together.
    Most welcome home!    
                   Exeunt Ambassadors.
  Pol. This business is well ended.
    My liege, and madam
, to expostulate
    What majesty should be, what duty is,
    Why day is day, night is night, and
 time is time.
    Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time.
    Therefore, since brevity is
 the soul of wit,
    And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
    I will be brief. Your 
noble son is mad.
    Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,
    What is't but to be nothing 
else but mad?
    But let that go.
  Queen. More matter, with less art.
  Pol. Madam, I swear I u
se no art at all.
    That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
    And pity 'tis 'tis true.
 A foolish figure!
    But farewell it, for I will use no art.
    Mad let us grant him then. And 
now remains
    That we find out the cause of this effect-
    Or rather say, the cause of this de
fect,
    For this effect defective comes by cause.
    Thus it remains, and the remainder thus.

    Perpend.
    I have a daughter (have while she is mine),
    Who in her duty and obedience, ma
rk,
    Hath given me this. Now gather, and surmise.
                                             
[Reads] the letter.
    'To the celestial, and my soul's idol, the most beautified
      Ophelia,'
-

    That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is a vile
      phrase.
    But you sha
ll hear. Thus:
                                                        [Reads.]
    'In her excell
ent white bosom, these, &c.'
  Queen. Came this from Hamlet to her?
  Pol. Good madam, stay awhile
. I will be faithful.     [Reads.]


          'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
            Doubt
 that the sun doth move;
          Doubt truth to be a liar;
            But never doubt I love.

      'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers; I have not art
to
    reckon my groans; but that
 I love thee best, O most best,
believe
    it. Adieu.
      'Thine evermore, most dear lady, whi
lst this machine is to
him,

HAMLET.'

    This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me;
    
And more above, hath his solicitings,
    As they fell out by time, by means, and place,
    All g
iven to mine ear.
  King. But how hath she
    Receiv'd his love?
  Pol. What do you think of me?

  King. As of a man faithful and honourable.
  Pol. I would fain prove so. But what might you thi
nk,
    When I had seen this hot love on the wing
    (As I perceiv'd it, I must tell you that,
 
   Before my daughter told me), what might you,
    Or my dear Majesty your queen here, think,
   
 If I had play'd the desk or table book,
    Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
    Or lo
ok'd upon this love with idle sight?
    What might you think? No, I went round to work
    And my
 young mistress thus I did bespeak:
    'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star.
    This must n
ot be.' And then I prescripts gave her,
    That she should lock herself from his resort,
    Admi
t no messengers, receive no tokens.
    Which done, she took the fruits of my advice,
    And he, 
repulsed, a short tale to make,
    Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
    Thence to a watch, 
thence into a weakness,
    Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
    Into the madness w
herein now he raves,
    And all we mourn for.
  King. Do you think 'tis this?
  Queen. it may be
, very like.
  Pol. Hath there been such a time- I would fain know that-
    That I have Positivel
y said ''Tis so,'
    When it prov'd otherwise.?
  King. Not that I know.
  Pol. [points to his h
ead and shoulder] Take this from this, if
this
      be otherwise.
    If circumstances lead me, 
I will find
    Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
    Within the centre.
  King. How 
may we try it further?
  Pol. You know sometimes he walks for hours together
    Here in the lobby
.
  Queen. So he does indeed.
  Pol. At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him.
    Be you and
 I behind an arras then.
    Mark the encounter. If he love her not,
    And he not from his reaso
n fall'n thereon
    Let me be no assistant for a state,
    But keep a farm and carters.
  King.
 We will try it.

                 Enter Hamlet, reading on a book.

  Queen. But look where sad
ly the poor wretch comes reading.
  Pol. Away, I do beseech you, both away
    I'll board him pres
ently. O, give me leave.
                       Exeunt King and Queen, [with Attendants].
    How 
does my good Lord Hamlet?
  Ham. Well, God-a-mercy.
  Pol. Do you know me, my lord?
  Ham. Excell
ent well. You are a fishmonger.
  Pol. Not I, my lord.
  Ham. Then I would you were so honest a ma
n.
  Pol. Honest, my lord?
  Ham. Ay, sir. To be honest, as this world goes, is to be one
man
  
  pick'd out of ten thousand.
  Pol. That's very true, my lord.
  Ham. For if the sun breed maggot
s in a dead dog, being a god
    kissing carrion- Have you a daughter?
  Pol. I have, my lord.
  
Ham. Let her not walk i' th' sun. Conception is a blessing, but
not
    as your daughter may conce
ive. Friend, look to't.
  Pol. [aside] How say you by that? Still harping on my daughter.
Yet
   
 he knew me not at first. He said I was a fishmonger. He is
far
    gone, far gone! And truly in m
y youth I suff'red much
extremity
    for love- very near this. I'll speak to him again.- What do

you
    read, my lord?
  Ham. Words, words, words.
  Pol. What is the matter, my lord?
  Ham. B
etween who?
  Pol. I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
  Ham. Slanders, sir; for the satiri
cal rogue says here that old
men
    have grey beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes

    purging thick amber and plum-tree gum; and that they have a
    plentiful lack of wit, together
 with most weak hams. All
which,
    sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I
ho
ld it
    not honesty to have it thus set down; for you yourself, sir,
    should be old as I am i
f, like a crab, you could go backward.

  Pol. [aside] Though this be madness, yet there is a meth
od
in't.-
   Will You walk out of the air, my lord?
  Ham. Into my grave?
  Pol. Indeed, that is
 out o' th' air. [Aside] How pregnant
sometimes
    his replies are! a happiness that often madnes
s hits on,
which
    reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of.
I
    will lea
ve him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting
between
    him and my daughter.- My honourable 
lord, I will most humbly
take
    my leave of you.
  Ham. You cannot, sir, take from me anything 
that I will more
    willingly part withal- except my life, except my life, except
my
    life,


                    Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Pol. Fare you well, my lord.
  Ham. 
These tedious old fools!
  Pol. You go to seek the Lord Hamlet. There he is.
  Ros. [to Polonius] 
God save you, sir!
                                                Exit [Polonius].

  Guil. My h
onour'd lord!
  Ros. My most dear lord!
  Ham. My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenst
ern?
Ah,
    Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
  Ros. As the indifferent children of the ea
rth.
  Guil. Happy in that we are not over-happy.
    On Fortune's cap we are not the very button.

  Ham. Nor the soles of her shoe?
  Ros. Neither, my lord.
  Ham. Then you live about her waist,
 or in the middle of her
    favours?
  Guil. Faith, her privates we.
  Ham. In the secret parts 
of Fortune? O! most true! she is a
    strumpet. What news ?
  Ros. None, my lord, but that the wo
rld's grown honest.
  Ham. Then is doomsday near! But your news is not true. Let me
    question m
ore in particular. What have you, my good friends,
    deserved at the hands of Fortune that she se
nds you to prison
    hither?
  Guil. Prison, my lord?
  Ham. Denmark's a prison.
  Ros. Then is
 the world one.
  Ham. A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and
    dungeons, De
nmark being one o' th' worst.
  Ros. We think not so, my lord.
  Ham. Why, then 'tis none to you; 
for there is nothing either
good
    or bad but thinking makes it so. To me it is a prison.
  Ros
. Why, then your ambition makes it one. 'Tis too narrow for
your
    mind.
  Ham. O God, I could 
be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a
    king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad
 dreams.
  Guil. Which dreams indeed are ambition; for the very substance
of
    the ambitious is
 merely the shadow of a dream.
  Ham. A dream itself is but a shadow.
  Ros. Truly, and I hold amb
ition of so airy and light a quality
that
    it is but a shadow's shadow.
  Ham. Then are our be
ggars bodies, and our monarchs and
outstretch'd
    heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we to th' c
ourt? for, by
my
    fay, I cannot reason.
  Both. We'll wait upon you.
  Ham. No such matter! I
 will not sort you with the rest of my
    servants; for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am 
most
    dreadfully attended. But in the beaten way of friendship,
what
    make you at Elsinore?

  Ros. To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
  Ham. Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thank
s; but I thank
you;
    and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny.
Were
    you
 not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free
    visitation? Come, deal justly with me. Co
me, come! Nay,
speak.
  Guil. What should we say, my lord?
  Ham. Why, anything- but to th' purpo
se. You were sent for; and
    there is a kind of confession in your looks, which your
modesties

    have not craft enough to colour. I know the good King and
Queen
    have sent for you.
  Ros.
 To what end, my lord?
  Ham. That you must teach me. But let me conjure you by the
rights
    of
 our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the
    obligation of our ever-preserved love, 
and by what more dear
a
    better proposer could charge you withal, be even and direct
with
   
 me, whether you were sent for or no.
  Ros. [aside to Guildenstern] What say you?
  Ham. [aside] 
Nay then, I have an eye of you.- If you love me,
hold
    not off.
  Guil. My lord, we were sent 
for.
  Ham. I will tell you why. So shall my anticipation prevent your
    discovery, and your sec
recy to the King and Queen moult no
    feather. I have of late- but wherefore I know not- lost all

my
    mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes
so
    heavily with my dispo
sition that this goodly frame, the
earth,
    seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellen
t canopy,
the
    air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this
majestical
    roof fret
ted with golden fire- why, it appeareth no other
thing
    to me than a foul and pestilent congreg
ation of vapours. What
a
    piece of work is a man! how noble in reason! how infinite in
    fac
ulties! in form and moving how express and admirable! in
    action how like an angel! in apprehens
ion how like a god! the
    beauty of the world, the paragon of animals! And yet to me
what
    i
s this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me- no, nor
woman
    neither, though by your smilin
g you seem to say so.
  Ros. My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.
  Ham. Why did you l
augh then, when I said 'Man delights not me'?
  Ros. To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, 
what lenten
    entertainment the players shall receive from you. We coted
them
    on the way, a
nd hither are they coming to offer you service.
  Ham. He that plays the king shall be welcome- his
 Majesty shall
    have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil
and
    target; 
the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humorous man
shall
    end his part in peace; the clown shall
 make those laugh whose
    lungs are tickle o' th' sere; and the lady shall say her mind
    free
ly, or the blank verse shall halt for't. What players are
    they?
  Ros. Even those you were won
t to take such delight in, the
    tragedians of the city.
  Ham. How chances it they travel? Thei
r residence, both in
    reputation and profit, was better both ways.
  Ros. I think their inhibit
ion comes by the means of the late
    innovation.
  Ham. Do they hold the same estimation they di
d when I was in
the
    city? Are they so follow'd?
  Ros. No indeed are they not.
  Ham. How co
mes it? Do they grow rusty?
  Ros. Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there
is,
 
   sir, an eyrie of children, little eyases, that cry out on the
top
    of question and are most 
tyrannically clapp'd for't. These
are now
    the fashion, and so berattle the common stages (so t
hey call
    them) that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goosequills and
    dare scarce come th
ither.
  Ham. What, are they children? Who maintains 'em? How are they
    escoted? Will they purs
ue the quality no longer than they can
    sing? Will they not say afterwards, if they should grow

    themselves to common players (as it is most like, if their
means
    are no better), their wr
iters do them wrong to make them
exclaim
    against their own succession.
  Ros. Faith, there ha
s been much to do on both sides; and the
nation
    holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy. 
There was, for
a
    while, no money bid for argument unless the poet and the
player
    went to
 cuffs in the question.
  Ham. Is't possible?
  Guil. O, there has been much throwing about of bra
ins.
  Ham. Do the boys carry it away?
  Ros. Ay, that they do, my lord- Hercules and his load too
.
  Ham. It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark,
and
    those that would make m
ows at him while my father lived give
    twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his pic
ture
in
    little. 'Sblood, there is something in this more than
natural, if
    philosophy cou
ld find it out.

                     Flourish for the Players.

  Guil. There are the players.

  Ham. Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come!
Th'
    appurtenance of welcome 
is fashion and ceremony. Let me
comply
    with you in this garb, lest my extent to the players (w
hich I
    tell you must show fairly outwards) should more appear like
    entertainment than your
s. You are welcome. But my
uncle-father
    and aunt-mother are deceiv'd.
  Guil. In what, my dea
r lord?
  Ham. I am but mad north-north-west. When the wind is southerly
I
    know a hawk from a
 handsaw.

                            Enter Polonius.

  Pol. Well be with you, gentlemen!
  H
am. Hark you, Guildenstern- and you too- at each ear a hearer!
    That great baby you see there is
 not yet out of his swaddling
    clouts.
  Ros. Happily he's the second time come to them; for th
ey say an
old
    man is twice a child.
  Ham. I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players
. Mark
it.-
   You say right, sir; a Monday morning; twas so indeed.
  Pol. My lord, I have news 
to tell you.
  Ham. My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an
actor in
    Rome-
  P
ol. The actors are come hither, my lord.
  Ham. Buzz, buzz!
  Pol. Upon my honour-
  Ham. Then ca
me each actor on his ass-
  Pol. The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy,
    his
tory, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral,
    tragical-historical, tragical-comical-hi
storical-pastoral;
scene
    individable, or poem unlimited. Seneca cannot be too heavy,
nor
   
 Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these
are
    the only men.
  Ham. O Jep
hthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
  Pol. What treasure had he, my lord?
  Ham. W
hy,

         'One fair daughter, and no more,
           The which he loved passing well.'

  
Pol. [aside] Still on my daughter.
  Ham. Am I not i' th' right, old Jephthah?
  Pol. If you call 
me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I
    love passing well.
  Ham. Nay, that follows not
.
  Pol. What follows then, my lord?
  Ham. Why,

           'As by lot, God wot,'

 and then,
 you know,

           'It came to pass, as most like it was.'

    The first row of the pious c
hanson will show you more; for
look
    where my abridgment comes.

                     Enter f
our or five Players.

    You are welcome, masters; welcome, all.- I am glad to see
thee
    wel
l.- Welcome, good friends.- O, my old friend? Why, thy
face is
    valanc'd since I saw thee last.
 Com'st' thou to' beard me in
    Denmark?- What, my young lady and mistress? By'r Lady, your
    
ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last by the
    altitude of a chopine. Pray God yo
ur voice, like a piece of
    uncurrent gold, be not crack'd within the ring.- Masters, you
are
 
   all welcome. We'll e'en to't like French falconers, fly at
    anything we see. We'll have a spe
ech straight. Come, give us
a
    taste of your quality. Come, a passionate speech.
  1. Play. Wh
at speech, my good lord?
  Ham. I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never
acted;
    
or if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember,
pleas'd
    not the million, 'twas caviary
 to the general; but it was (as
I
    receiv'd it, and others, whose judgments in such matters
cr
ied in
    the top of mine) an excellent play, well digested in the
scenes,
    set down with as 
much modesty as cunning. I remember one said
    there were no sallets in the lines to make the mat
ter
savoury,
    nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of
    affectation; but
 call'd it an honest method, as wholesome as
    sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. O
ne speech
in't
    I chiefly lov'd. 'Twas AEneas' tale to Dido, and thereabout
of it
    especia
lly where he speaks of Priam's slaughter. If it live
in
    your memory, begin at this line- let m
e see, let me see:

         'The rugged Pyrrhus, like th' Hyrcanian beast-'

    'Tis not so; i
t begins with Pyrrhus:

         'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
         Black as his 
purpose, did the night resemble
         When he lay couched in the ominous horse,
         Hath n
ow this dread and black complexion smear'd
         With heraldry more dismal. Head to foot
      
   Now is be total gules, horridly trick'd
         With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons
,
         Bak'd and impasted with the parching streets,
         That lend a tyrannous and a damn
ed light
         To their lord's murther. Roasted in wrath and fire,
         And thus o'ersized 
with coagulate gore,
         With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
         Old grandsir
e Priam seeks.'

    So, proceed you.
  Pol. Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and
 good
     discretion.

  1. Play. 'Anon he finds him,
      Striking too short at Greeks. His a
ntique sword,
      Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
      Repugnant to command. Unequa
l match'd,
      Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide;
      But with the whiff and wind 
of his fell sword
      Th' unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
      Seeming to feel thi
s blow, with flaming top
      Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
      Takes prisoner P
yrrhus' ear. For lo! his sword,
      Which was declining on the milky head
      Of reverend Pria
m, seem'd i' th' air to stick.
      So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
      And, like a neu
tral to his will and matter,
      Did nothing.
      But, as we often see, against some storm,
 
     A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
      The bold winds speechless, and the orb b
elow
      As hush as death- anon the dreadful thunder
      Doth rend the region; so, after Pyrrh
us' pause,
      Aroused vengeance sets him new awork;
      And never did the Cyclops' hammers fa
ll
      On Mars's armour, forg'd for proof eterne,
      With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding
 sword
      Now falls on Priam.
      Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods,
      In ge
neral synod take away her power;
      Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
      And 
bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
      As low as to the fiends!

  Pol. This is too l
ong.
  Ham. It shall to the barber's, with your beard.- Prithee say
on.
    He's for a jig or a t
ale of bawdry, or he sleeps. Say on;
come to
    Hecuba.

  1. Play. 'But who, O who, had seen t
he mobled queen-'

  Ham. 'The mobled queen'?
  Pol. That's good! 'Mobled queen' is good.

  1.
 Play. 'Run barefoot up and down, threat'ning the flames
      With bisson rheum; a clout upon that
 head
      Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
      About her lank and all o'erteemed l
oins,
      A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up-
      Who this had seen, with tongue in ven
om steep'd
      'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have pronounc'd.
      But if the gods them
selves did see her then,
      When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
      In Mincing with his
 sword her husband's limbs,
      The instant burst of clamour that she made
      (Unless things 
mortal move them not at all)
      Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven
      And pass
ion in the gods.'

  Pol. Look, whe'r he has not turn'd his colour, and has tears
in's
    eyes.
 Prithee no more!
  Ham. 'Tis well. I'll have thee speak out the rest of this
soon.-
    Good my 
lord, will you see the players well bestow'd? Do you
    hear? Let them be well us'd; for they are 
the abstract and
brief
    chronicles of the time. After your death you were better have
a
    b
ad epitaph than their ill report while you live.
  Pol. My lord, I will use them according to their
 desert.
  Ham. God's bodykins, man, much better! Use every man after his
    desert, and who shou
ld scape whipping? Use them after your
own
    honour and dignity. The less they deserve, the more
 merit is
in
    your bounty. Take them in.
  Pol. Come, sirs.
  Ham. Follow him, friends. We'll
 hear a play to-morrow.
                 Exeunt Polonius and Players [except the First].
    Dost 
thou hear me, old friend? Can you play 'The Murther of
    Gonzago'?
  1. Play. Ay, my lord.
  Ha
m. We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need, study a
    speech of some dozen or sixteen l
ines which I would set down
and
    insert in't, could you not?
  1. Play. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. V
ery well. Follow that lord- and look you mock him not.
                                            
[Exit First Player.]
    My good friends, I'll leave you till night. You are welcome
to
    Elsin
ore.
  Ros. Good my lord!
  Ham. Ay, so, God b' wi' ye!
                            [Exeunt Rosen
crantz and Guildenstern
    Now I am alone.
    O what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
    Is it 
not monstrous that this player here,
    But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
    Could force 
his soul so to his own conceit
    That, from her working, all his visage wann'd,
    Tears in his
 eyes, distraction in's aspect,
    A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
    With forms 
to his conceit? And all for nothing!
    For Hecuba!
    What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
 
   That he should weep for her? What would he do,
    Had he the motive and the cue for passion
  
  That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
    And cleave the general ear with horrid speec
h;
    Make mad the guilty and appal the free,
    Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed
    Th
e very faculties of eyes and ears.
    Yet I,
    A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak
    Like 
John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
    And can say nothing! No, not for a king,
    Upon whose
 property and most dear life
    A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
    Who calls me villain
? breaks my pate across?
    Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?
    Tweaks me by th' nos
e? gives me the lie i' th' throat
    As deep as to the lungs? Who does me this, ha?
    'Swounds,
 I should take it! for it cannot be
    But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall
    To make oppressi
on bitter, or ere this
    I should have fatted all the region kites
    With this slave's offal. 
Bloody bawdy villain!
    Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
    O, vengeance!

    Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
    That I, the son of a dear father murther'd,
 
   Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
    Must (like a whore) unpack my heart with words
 
   And fall a-cursing like a very drab,
    A scullion!
    Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! Hum,
 I have heard
    That guilty creatures, sitting at a play,
    Have by the very cunning of the sc
ene
    Been struck so to the soul that presently
    They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
  
  For murther, though it have no tongue, will speak
    With most miraculous organ, I'll have these
 Players
    Play something like the murther of my father
    Before mine uncle. I'll observe his 
looks;
    I'll tent him to the quick. If he but blench,
    I know my course. The spirit that I h
ave seen
    May be a devil; and the devil hath power
    T' assume a pleasing shape; yea, and per
haps
    Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
    As he is very potent with such spirits,
    Ab
uses me to damn me. I'll have grounds
    More relative than this. The play's the thing
    Wherei
n I'll catch the conscience of the King.         Exit.

ACT III. Scene I.
Elsin
ore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern,
and 
Lords.

  King. And can you by no drift of circumstance
    Get from him why he puts on this conf
usion,
    Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
    With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
  Ro
s. He does confess he feels himself distracted,
    But from what cause he will by no means speak.

  Guil. Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
    But with a crafty madness keeps aloof
    W
hen we would bring him on to some confession
    Of his true state.
  Queen. Did he receive you we
ll?
  Ros. Most like a gentleman.
  Guil. But with much forcing of his disposition.
  Ros. Niggar
d of question, but of our demands
    Most free in his reply.
  Queen. Did you assay him
    To a
ny pastime?
  Ros. Madam, it so fell out that certain players
    We o'erraught on the way. Of the
se we told him,
    And there did seem in him a kind of joy
    To hear of it. They are here about
 the court,
    And, as I think, they have already order
    This night to play before him.
  Pol
. 'Tis most true;
    And he beseech'd me to entreat your Majesties
    To hear and see the matter
.
  King. With all my heart, and it doth much content me
    To hear him so inclin'd.
    Good ge
ntlemen, give him a further edge
    And drive his purpose on to these delights.
  Ros. We shall, 
my lord.
                            Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
  King. Sweet Gertrude, 
leave us too;
    For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
    That he, as 'twere by accident, 
may here
    Affront Ophelia.
    Her father and myself (lawful espials)
    Will so bestow ourse
lves that, seeing unseen,
    We may of their encounter frankly judge
    And gather by him, as he
 is behav'd,
    If't be th' affliction of his love, or no,
    That thus he suffers for.
  Queen
. I shall obey you;
    And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
    That your good beauties be the h
appy cause
    Of Hamlet's wildness. So shall I hope your virtues
    Will bring him to his wonted
 way again,
    To both your honours.
  Oph. Madam, I wish it may.
                              
                     [Exit Queen.]
  Pol. Ophelia, walk you here.- Gracious, so please you,
    We
 will bestow ourselves.- [To Ophelia] Read on this book,
    That show of such an exercise may colo
ur
    Your loneliness.- We are oft to blame in this,
    'Tis too much prov'd, that with devotion
's visage
    And pious action we do sugar o'er
    The Devil himself.
  King. [aside] O, 'tis to
o true!
    How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
    The harlot's cheek, beautied
 with plast'ring art,
    Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
    Than is my deed to my mo
st painted word.
    O heavy burthen!
  Pol. I hear him coming. Let's withdraw, my lord.
        
                              Exeunt King and Polonius].

                           Enter Hamlet.


  Ham. To be, or not to be- that is the question:
    Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer

    The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
    Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
 
   And by opposing end them. To die- to sleep-
    No more; and by a sleep to say we end
    The h
eartache, and the thousand natural shocks
    That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation
    Devou
tly to be wish'd. To die- to sleep.
    To sleep- perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub!
    For
 in that sleep of death what dreams may come
    When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
    M
ust give us pause. There's the respect
    That makes calamity of so long life.
    For who would 
bear the whips and scorns of time,
    Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
    The p
angs of despis'd love, the law's delay,
    The insolence of office, and the spurns
    That patie
nt merit of th' unworthy takes,
    When he himself might his quietus make
    With a bare bodkin?
 Who would these fardels bear,
    To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
    But that the dread o
f something after death-
    The undiscover'd country, from whose bourn
    No traveller returns- 
puzzles the will,
    And makes us rather bear those ills we have
    Than fly to others that we k
now not of?
    Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
    And thus the native hue of resolu
tion
    Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
    And enterprises of great pith and mom
ent
    With this regard their currents turn awry
    And lose the name of action.- Soft you now!

    The fair Ophelia!- Nymph, in thy orisons
    Be all my sins rememb'red.
  Oph. Good my lord,

    How does your honour for this many a day?
  Ham. I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
  Oph.
 My lord, I have remembrances of yours
    That I have longed long to re-deliver.
    I pray you, 
now receive them.
  Ham. No, not I!
    I never gave you aught.
  Oph. My honour'd lord, you know
 right well you did,
    And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd
    As made the things mo
re rich. Their perfume lost,
    Take these again; for to the noble mind
    Rich gifts wax poor w
hen givers prove unkind.
    There, my lord.
  Ham. Ha, ha! Are you honest?
  Oph. My lord?
  Ha
m. Are you fair?
  Oph. What means your lordship?
  Ham. That if you be honest and fair, your hone
sty should admit
no
    discourse to your beauty.
  Oph. Could beauty, my lord, have better comme
rce than with
honesty?
  Ham. Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform
    honest
y from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty
can
    translate beauty into his likeness. 
This was sometime a
paradox,
    but now the time gives it proof. I did love you once.
  Oph. Ind
eed, my lord, you made me believe so.
  Ham. You should not have believ'd me; for virtue cannot so

    inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it. I loved
you
    not.
  Oph. I was the mor
e deceived.
  Ham. Get thee to a nunnery! Why wouldst thou be a breeder of
    sinners? I am mysel
f indifferent honest, but yet I could
accuse
    me of such things that it were better my mother h
ad not borne
me.
    I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more offences at
my
    beck t
han I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give
    them shape, or time to act them in. Wha
t should such fellows
as I
    do, crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves
all;

    believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where's your
    father?
  Oph. At home, my lord
.
  Ham. Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool
    nowhere but in's own house.
 Farewell.
  Oph. O, help him, you sweet heavens!
  Ham. If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this p
lague for thy
dowry:
    be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not
escape
    ca
lumny. Get thee to a nunnery. Go, farewell. Or if thou wilt
    needs marry, marry a fool; for wise
 men know well enough what
    monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go; and quickly too.
    F
arewell.
  Oph. O heavenly powers, restore him!
  Ham. I have heard of your paintings too, well en
ough. God hath
    given you one face, and you make yourselves another. You jig,
you
    amble, a
nd you lisp; you nickname God's creatures and make
your
    wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I'll
 no more on't! it hath
made
    me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages. Those that are
   
 married already- all but one- shall live; the rest shall keep
as
    they are. To a nunnery, go. 
                           Exit.
  Oph. O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
    The courtier'
s, scholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword,
    Th' expectancy and rose of the fair state,
    Th
e glass of fashion and the mould of form,
    Th' observ'd of all observers- quite, quite down!
  
  And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
    That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
    Now 
see that noble and most sovereign reason,
    Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
   
 That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
    Blasted with ecstasy. O, woe is me
    T' have
 seen what I have seen, see what I see!

                   Enter King and Polonius.

  King. Lo
ve? his affections do not that way tend;
    Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,
  
  Was not like madness. There's something in his soul
    O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;

    And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
    Will be some danger; which for to prevent,
    
I have in quick determination
    Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England
    For the dem
and of our neglected tribute.
    Haply the seas, and countries different,
    With variable objec
ts, shall expel
    This something-settled matter in his heart,
    Whereon his brains still beati
ng puts him thus
    From fashion of himself. What think you on't?
  Pol. It shall do well. But ye
t do I believe
    The origin and commencement of his grief
    Sprung from neglected love.- How n
ow, Ophelia?
    You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said.
    We heard it all.- My lord, do as 
you please;
    But if you hold it fit, after the play
    Let his queen mother all alone entreat 
him
    To show his grief. Let her be round with him;
    And I'll be plac'd so please you, in the
 ear
    Of all their conference. If she find him not,
    To England send him; or confine him whe
re
    Your wisdom best shall think.
  King. It shall be so.
    Madness in great ones must not u
nwatch'd go.         Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. hall in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet and t
hree of the Players.

  Ham. Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounc'd it to you,
    trippin
gly on the tongue. But if you mouth it, as many of our
    players do, I had as live the town crier
 spoke my lines. Nor
do
    not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all
    gently
; for in the very torrent, tempest, and (as I may say)
    whirlwind of your passion, you must acqu
ire and beget a
    temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to
the
    soul to h
ear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion
to
    tatters, to very rags, to split the ca
rs of the groundlings,
who
    (for the most part) are capable of nothing but inexplicable
dumb

    shows and noise. I would have such a fellow whipp'd for
o'erdoing
    Termagant. It out-herods
 Herod. Pray you avoid it.
  Player. I warrant your honour.
  Ham. Be not too tame neither; but le
t your own discretion be
your
    tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the action;
wit
h
    this special observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of
    nature: for anything so ov
erdone is from the purpose of
playing,
    whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to ho
ld, as
    'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show Virtue her own
feature,
    scorn her own ima
ge, and the very age and body of the time
his
    form and pressure. Now this overdone, or come ta
rdy off,
though
    it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious
    grieve; the ce
nsure of the which one must in your allowance
    o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be 
players that
I
    have seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly (not
to
    speak it
 profanely), that, neither having the accent of
    Christians, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, n
or man, have
so
    strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of Nature's
    journeymen had
 made men, and not made them well, they
imitated
    humanity so abominably.
  Player. I hope we 
have reform'd that indifferently with us,
sir.
  Ham. O, reform it altogether! And let those that 
play your
clowns
    speak no more than is set down for them. For there be of them
    that will 
themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren
    spectators to laugh too, though in the mean
 time some
necessary
    question of the play be then to be considered. That's
villanous
    and
 shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it.
Go
    make you ready.
                 
                                Exeunt Players.

            Enter Polonius, Rosencrantz, and Guil
denstern.

    How now, my lord? Will the King hear this piece of work?
  Pol. And the Queen too,
 and that presently.
  Ham. Bid the players make haste, [Exit Polonius.] Will you two
    help to 
hasten them?
  Both. We will, my lord.                       Exeunt they two.
  Ham. What, ho, Hor
atio!

                      Enter Horatio.

  Hor. Here, sweet lord, at your service.
  Ham. H
oratio, thou art e'en as just a man
    As e'er my conversation cop'd withal.
  Hor. O, my dear lo
rd!
  Ham. Nay, do not think I flatter;
    For what advancement may I hope from thee,
    That n
o revenue hast but thy good spirits
    To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?

    No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
    And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
  
  Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
    Since my dear soul was mistress of her choic
e
    And could of men distinguish, her election
    Hath seal'd thee for herself. For thou hast b
een
    As one, in suff'ring all, that suffers nothing;
    A man that Fortune's buffets and rewar
ds
    Hast ta'en with equal thanks; and blest are those
    Whose blood and judgment are so well 
commingled
    That they are not a pipe for Fortune's finger
    To sound what stop she please. Gi
ve me that man
    That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
    In my heart's core, ay, in
 my heart of heart,
    As I do thee. Something too much of this I
    There is a play to-night be
fore the King.
    One scene of it comes near the circumstance,
    Which I have told thee, of my 
father's death.
    I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
    Even with the very comment of t
hy soul
    Observe my uncle. If his occulted guilt
    Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
   
 It is a damned ghost that we have seen,
    And my imaginations are as foul
    As Vulcan's stith
y. Give him heedful note;
    For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,
    And after we will both o
ur judgments join
    In censure of his seeming.
  Hor. Well, my lord.
    If he steal aught the 
whilst this play is playing,
    And scape detecting, I will pay the theft.

    Sound a flourish
. [Enter Trumpets and Kettledrums. Danish
    march. [Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencr
antz,
      Guildenstern, and other Lords attendant, with the Guard
                       carryin
g torches.

  Ham. They are coming to the play. I must be idle.
    Get you a place.
  King. How
 fares our cousin Hamlet?
  Ham. Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish. I eat the
air,
   
 promise-cramm'd. You cannot feed capons so.
  King. I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet. These
 words are
not
    mine.
  Ham. No, nor mine now. [To Polonius] My lord, you play'd once
    i' 
th' university, you say?
  Pol. That did I, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.
  Ham. What d
id you enact?
  Pol. I did enact Julius Caesar; I was kill'd i' th' Capitol;
Brutus
    kill'd me
.
  Ham. It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf
there. Be
    the players ready.
 
 Ros. Ay, my lord. They stay upon your patience.
  Queen. Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.

  Ham. No, good mother. Here's metal more attractive.
  Pol. [to the King] O, ho! do you mark that?

  Ham. Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
                                  [Sits down at Ophelia's f
eet.]

  Oph. No, my lord.
  Ham. I mean, my head upon your lap?
  Oph. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Do 
you think I meant country matters?
  Oph. I think nothing, my lord.
  Ham. That's a fair thought t
o lie between maids' legs.
  Oph. What is, my lord?
  Ham. Nothing.
  Oph. You are merry, my lord
.
  Ham. Who, I?
  Oph. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. O God, your only jig-maker! What should a man do but 
be
merry?
    For look you how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father
died
    within 's two 
hours.
  Oph. Nay 'tis twice two months, my lord.
  Ham. So long? Nay then, let the devil wear bla
ck, for I'll have
a
    suit of sables. O heavens! die two months ago, and not
forgotten
    yet
? Then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his
life
    half a year. But, by'r Lady, he 
must build churches then; or
else
    shall he suffer not thinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose


    epitaph is 'For O, for O, the hobby-horse is forgot!'

               Hautboys play. The d
umb show enters.

    Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing
    him and he 
her. She kneels, and makes show of protestation
    unto him. He takes her up, and declines his hea
d upon her
    neck. He lays him down upon a bank of flowers. She, seeing
    him asleep, leaves h
im. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his
    crown, kisses it, pours poison in the sleeper's ears,
 and
    leaves him. The Queen returns, finds the King dead, and makes
    passionate action. The 
Poisoner with some three or four
Mutes,
    comes in again, seem to condole with her. The dead bod
y is
    carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with gifts; she
    seems harsh and unwilling 
awhile, but in the end accepts
    his love.
                                                     
    Exeunt.

  Oph. What means this, my lord?
  Ham. Marry, this is miching malhecho; it means mi
schief.
  Oph. Belike this show imports the argument of the play.

                      Enter Pr
ologue.

  Ham. We shall know by this fellow. The players cannot keep
counsel;
    they'll tell 
all.
  Oph. Will he tell us what this show meant?
  Ham. Ay, or any show that you'll show him. Be 
not you asham'd
to
    show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means.
  Oph. You are naught, yo
u are naught! I'll mark the play.

    Pro. For us, and for our tragedy,
      Here stooping to y
our clemency,
      We beg your hearing patiently.                     [Exit.]

  Ham. Is this a 
prologue, or the posy of a ring?
  Oph. 'Tis brief, my lord.
  Ham. As woman's love.

          
    Enter [two Players as] King and Queen.

    King. Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone ro
und
      Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
      And thirty dozen moons with borrowed
 sheen
      About the world have times twelve thirties been,
      Since love our hearts, and Hym
en did our hands,
      Unite comutual in most sacred bands.
    Queen. So many journeys may the s
un and moon
      Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
      But woe is me! you are so sick 
of late,
      So far from cheer and from your former state.
      That I distrust you. Yet, thoug
h I distrust,
      Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must;
      For women's fear and love hold
s quantity,
      In neither aught, or in extremity.
      Now what my love is, proof hath made yo
u know;
      And as my love is siz'd, my fear is so.
      Where love is great, the littlest doub
ts are fear;
      Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.
    King. Faith, I must 
leave thee, love, and shortly too;
      My operant powers their functions leave to do.
      And 
thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
      Honour'd, belov'd, and haply one as kind
      Fo
r husband shalt thou-
    Queen. O, confound the rest!
      Such love must needs be treason in my
 breast.
      When second husband let me be accurst!
      None wed the second but who killed the
 first.

  Ham. [aside] Wormwood, wormwood!

    Queen. The instances that second marriage move

      Are base respects of thrift, but none of love.
      A second time I kill my husband dead
 
     When second husband kisses me in bed.
    King. I do believe you think what now you speak;
  
    But what we do determine oft we break.
      Purpose is but the slave to memory,
      Of viol
ent birth, but poor validity;
      Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree,
      But fa
ll unshaken when they mellow be.
      Most necessary 'tis that we forget
      To pay ourselves w
hat to ourselves is debt.
      What to ourselves in passion we propose,
      The passion ending,
 doth the purpose lose.
      The violence of either grief or joy
      Their own enactures with t
hemselves destroy.
      Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
      Grief joys, joy grie
ves, on slender accident.
      This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
      That even ou
r loves should with our fortunes change;
      For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
      Whe
ther love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
      The great man down, you mark his favourite flie
s,
      The poor advanc'd makes friends of enemies;
      And hitherto doth love on fortune tend,

      For who not needs shall never lack a friend,
      And who in want a hollow friend doth try
,
      Directly seasons him his enemy.
      But, orderly to end where I begun,
      Our wills 
and fates do so contrary run
      That our devices still are overthrown;
      Our thoughts are o
urs, their ends none of our own.
      So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
      But die thy
 thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
    Queen. Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light,
   
   Sport and repose lock from me day and night,
      To desperation turn my trust and hope,
     
 An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope,
      Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
      Me
et what I would have well, and it destroy,
      Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
   
   If, once a widow, ever I be wife!

  Ham. If she should break it now!

    King. 'Tis deeply 
sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile.
      My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile
      The
 tedious day with sleep.
    Queen. Sleep rock thy brain,
                                        
            [He] sleeps.
      And never come mischance between us twain!
Exit.

  Ham. Madam, h
ow like you this play?
  Queen. The lady doth protest too much, methinks.
  Ham. O, but she'll kee
p her word.
  King. Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in't?
  Ham. No, no! They do 
but jest, poison in jest; no offence i'
th'
    world.
  King. What do you call the play?
  Ham.
 'The Mousetrap.' Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the
    image of a murther done in Vienna. G
onzago is the duke's
name;
    his wife, Baptista. You shall see anon. 'Tis a knavish piece
of
 
   work; but what o' that? Your Majesty, and we that have free
    souls, it touches us not. Let th
e gall'd jade winch; our
withers
    are unwrung.

                         Enter Lucianus.

 
   This is one Lucianus, nephew to the King.
  Oph. You are as good as a chorus, my lord.
  Ham. I
 could interpret between you and your love, if I could
see
    the puppets dallying.
  Oph. You a
re keen, my lord, you are keen.
  Ham. It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
  Oph. St
ill better, and worse.
  Ham. So you must take your husbands.- Begin, murtherer. Pox,
leave
    t
hy damnable faces, and begin! Come, the croaking raven doth
    bellow for revenge.

    Luc. Tho
ughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
      Confederate season, else no creature se
eing;
      Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,
      With Hecate's ban thrice blasted
, thrice infected,
      Thy natural magic and dire property
      On wholesome life usurp immedia
tely.
                                   Pours the poison in his ears.

  Ham. He poisons him i' 
th' garden for's estate. His name's
Gonzago.
    The story is extant, and written in very choice I
talian. You
    shall see anon how the murtherer gets the love of Gonzago's
wife.
  Oph. The King
 rises.
  Ham. What, frighted with false fire?
  Queen. How fares my lord?
  Pol. Give o'er the p
lay.
  King. Give me some light! Away!
  All. Lights, lights, lights!
                           
   Exeunt all but Hamlet and Horatio.
  Ham.   Why, let the strucken deer go weep,
          The h
art ungalled play;
         For some must watch, while some must sleep:
          Thus runs the wo
rld away.
    Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers- if the rest of
my
    fortunes turn 
Turk with me-with two Provincial roses on my
raz'd
    shoes, get me a fellowship in a cry of play
ers, sir?
  Hor. Half a share.
  Ham.   A whole one I!
         For thou dost know, O Damon dear,

           This realm dismantled was
         Of Jove himself; and now reigns here
           A 
very, very- pajock.
  Hor. You might have rhym'd.
  Ham. O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's wor
d for a thousand
    pound! Didst perceive?
  Hor. Very well, my lord.
  Ham. Upon the talk of th
e poisoning?
  Hor. I did very well note him.
  Ham.   Aha! Come, some music! Come, the recorders!

         For if the King like not the comedy,
         Why then, belike he likes it not, perdy.

    Come, some music!

                Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Guil. Good my lord
, vouchsafe me a word with you.
  Ham. Sir, a whole history.
  Guil. The King, sir-
  Ham. Ay, si
r, what of him?
  Guil. Is in his retirement, marvellous distemper'd.
  Ham. With drink, sir?
  G
uil. No, my lord; rather with choler.
  Ham. Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify 
this
to
    the doctor; for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps
    plunge him into far 
more choler.
  Guil. Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame, and
start
    not so wildl
y from my affair.
  Ham. I am tame, sir; pronounce.
  Guil. The Queen, your mother, in most great 
affliction of
spirit
    hath sent me to you.
  Ham. You are welcome.
  Guil. Nay, good my lord,
 this courtesy is not of the right
breed.
    If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer
, I will
do
    your mother's commandment; if not, your pardon and my return
    shall be the end
 of my business.
  Ham. Sir, I cannot.
  Guil. What, my lord?
  Ham. Make you a wholesome answer;
 my wit's diseas'd. But, sir,
such
    answer as I can make, you shall command; or rather, as you

say,
    my mother. Therefore no more, but to the matter! My mother,
you
    say-
  Ros. Then t
hus she says: your behaviour hath struck her into
    amazement and admiration.
  Ham. O wonderful
 son, that can so stonish a mother! But is
there no
    sequel at the heels of this mother's admir
ation? Impart.
  Ros. She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to
bed.
  Ham. We sh
all obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any
    further trade with us?
  Ros. My lord, y
ou once did love me.
  Ham. And do still, by these pickers and stealers!
  Ros. Good my lord, what
 is your cause of distemper? You do
surely
    bar the door upon your own liberty, if you deny you
r griefs
to
    your friend.
  Ham. Sir, I lack advancement.
  Ros. How can that be, when you ha
ve the voice of the King
himself
    for your succession in Denmark?
  Ham. Ay, sir, but 'while t
he grass grows'- the proverb is
something
    musty.

                     Enter the Players wit
h recorders.

    O, the recorders! Let me see one. To withdraw with you- why
do
    you go abou
t to recover the wind of me, as if you would drive
me
    into a toil?
  Guil. O my lord, if my d
uty be too bold, my love is too
unmannerly.
  Ham. I do not well understand that. Will you play up
on this
pipe?
  Guil. My lord, I cannot.
  Ham. I pray you.
  Guil. Believe me, I cannot.
  Ham
. I do beseech you.
  Guil. I know, no touch of it, my lord.
  Ham. It is as easy as lying. Govern
 these ventages with your
    fingers and thumbs, give it breath with your mouth, and it
will
   
 discourse most eloquent music. Look you, these are the stops.
  Guil. But these cannot I command t
o any utt'rance of harmony. I
    have not the skill.
  Ham. Why, look you now, how unworthy a thi
ng you make of me!
You
    would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you
would
    pl
uck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound me from my
    lowest note to the top of my compas
s; and there is much
music,
    excellent voice, in this little organ, yet cannot you make it
   
 speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am easier to be play'd on than
a
    pipe? Call me what instrument
 you will, though you can fret
me,
    you cannot play upon me.

                        Enter P
olonius.

    God bless you, sir!
  Pol. My lord, the Queen would speak with you, and presently.

  Ham. Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
  Pol. By th' mass, and 'tis lik
e a camel indeed.
  Ham. Methinks it is like a weasel.
  Pol. It is back'd like a weasel.
  Ham. 
Or like a whale.
  Pol. Very like a whale.
  Ham. Then will I come to my mother by-and-by.- They f
ool me to
the
    top of my bent.- I will come by-and-by.
  Pol. I will say so.                  
                    Exit.
  Ham. 'By-and-by' is easily said.- Leave me, friends.
                 
                       [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]

    'Tis now the very witching time of night,
  
  When churchyards yawn, and hell itself breathes out
    Contagion to this world. Now could I drin
k hot blood
    And do such bitter business as the day
    Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my
 mother!
    O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever
    The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom
.
    Let me be cruel, not unnatural;
    I will speak daggers to her, but use none.
    My tongu
e and soul in this be hypocrites-
    How in my words somever she be shent,
    To give them seals
 never, my soul, consent!             Exit.




Scene III.
A room in the Castle.

Enter King
, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.

  King. I like him not, nor stands it safe with us
    To let h
is madness range. Therefore prepare you;
    I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
    And he
 to England shall along with you.
    The terms of our estate may not endure
    Hazard so near us
 as doth hourly grow
    Out of his lunacies.
  Guil. We will ourselves provide.
    Most holy an
d religious fear it is
    To keep those many many bodies safe
    That live and feed upon your Ma
jesty.
  Ros. The single and peculiar life is bound
    With all the strength and armour of the mi
nd
    To keep itself from noyance; but much more
    That spirit upon whose weal depends and rest
s
    The lives of many. The cesse of majesty
    Dies not alone, but like a gulf doth draw
    W
hat's near it with it. It is a massy wheel,
    Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,
    To w
hose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
    Are mortis'd and adjoin'd; which when it falls,
  
  Each small annexment, petty consequence,
    Attends the boist'rous ruin. Never alone
    Did th
e king sigh, but with a general groan.
  King. Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;
    For
 we will fetters put upon this fear,
    Which now goes too free-footed.
  Both. We will haste us.

                                               Exeunt Gentlemen.

                   Enter Polon
ius.

  Pol. My lord, he's going to his mother's closet.
    Behind the arras I'll convey myself

    To hear the process. I'll warrant she'll tax him home;
    And, as you said, and wisely was it
 said,
    'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,
    Since nature makes them partial, s
hould o'erhear
    The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege.
    I'll call upon you ere you
 go to bed
    And tell you what I know.
  King. Thanks, dear my lord.
                          
                      Exit [Polonius].
    O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven;
    It hath
 the primal eldest curse upon't,
    A brother's murther! Pray can I not,
    Though inclination b
e as sharp as will.
    My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent,
    And, like a man to double 
business bound,
    I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
    And both neglect. What if this
 cursed hand
    Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,
    Is there not rain enough in th
e sweet heavens
    To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
    But to confront the visage 
of offence?
    And what's in prayer but this twofold force,
    To be forestalled ere we come to 
fall,
    Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;
    My fault is past. But, O, what form of pr
ayer
    Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murther'?
    That cannot be; since I am still pos
sess'd
    Of those effects for which I did the murther-
    My crown, mine own ambition, and my q
ueen.
    May one be pardon'd and retain th' offence?
    In the corrupted currents of this world

    Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,
    And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
   
 Buys out the law; but 'tis not so above.
    There is no shuffling; there the action lies
    In 
his true nature, and we ourselves compell'd,
    Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
   
 To give in evidence. What then? What rests?
    Try what repentance can. What can it not?
    Yet
 what can it when one cannot repent?
    O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
    O limed sou
l, that, struggling to be free,
    Art more engag'd! Help, angels! Make assay.
    Bow, stubborn 
knees; and heart with strings of steel,
    Be soft as sinews of the new-born babe!
    All may be
 well.                                  He kneels.

                         Enter Hamlet.

  Ha
m. Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
    And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven,
    
And so am I reveng'd. That would be scann'd.
    A villain kills my father; and for that,
    I, h
is sole son, do this same villain send
    To heaven.
    Why, this is hire and salary, not reveng
e!
    He took my father grossly, full of bread,
    With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as 
May;
    And how his audit stands, who knows save heaven?
    But in our circumstance and course o
f thought,
    'Tis heavy with him; and am I then reveng'd,
    To take him in the purging of his 
soul,
    When he is fit and seasoned for his passage?
    No.
    Up, sword, and know thou a mor
e horrid hent.
    When he is drunk asleep; or in his rage;
    Or in th' incestuous pleasure of h
is bed;
    At gaming, swearing, or about some act
    That has no relish of salvation in't-
    
Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,
    And that his soul may be as damn'd and black

    As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays.
    This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.      
        Exit.
  King. [rises] My words fly up, my thoughts remain below.
    Words without thought
s never to heaven go.             Exit.




Scene IV.
The Queen's closet.

Enter Queen and P
olonius.

  Pol. He will come straight. Look you lay home to him.
    Tell him his pranks have be
en too broad to bear with,
    And that your Grace hath screen'd and stood between
    Much heat a
nd him. I'll silence me even here.
    Pray you be round with him.
  Ham. (within) Mother, mother,
 mother!
  Queen. I'll warrant you; fear me not. Withdraw; I hear him
coming.
                   
           [Polonius hides behind the arras.]

                          Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. N
ow, mother, what's the matter?
  Queen. Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
  Ham. Mother,
 you have my father much offended.
  Queen. Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
  Ham. Go,
 go, you question with a wicked tongue.
  Queen. Why, how now, Hamlet?
  Ham. What's the matter no
w?
  Queen. Have you forgot me?
  Ham. No, by the rood, not so!
    You are the Queen, your husba
nd's brother's wife,
    And (would it were not so!) you are my mother.
  Queen. Nay, then I'll se
t those to you that can speak.
  Ham. Come, come, and sit you down. You shall not budge;
    You g
o not till I set you up a glass
    Where you may see the inmost part of you.
  Queen. What wilt t
hou do? Thou wilt not murther me?
    Help, help, ho!
  Pol. [behind] What, ho! help, help, help!

  Ham. [draws] How now? a rat? Dead for a ducat, dead!
            [Makes a pass through the arras
 and] kills Polonius.
  Pol. [behind] O, I am slain!
  Queen. O me, what hast thou done?
  Ham. N
ay, I know not. Is it the King?
  Queen. O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
  Ham. A bloody d
eed- almost as bad, good mother,
    As kill a king, and marry with his brother.
  Queen. As kill 
a king?
  Ham. Ay, lady, it was my word.
                         [Lifts up the arras and sees Pol
onius.]
    Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
    I took thee for thy better. Take th
y fortune.
    Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.
    Leave wringing of your hands. Peace
! sit you down
    And let me wring your heart; for so I shall
    If it be made of penetrable stu
ff;
    If damned custom have not braz'd it so
    That it is proof and bulwark against sense.
  
Queen. What have I done that thou dar'st wag thy tongue
    In noise so rude against me?
  Ham. Su
ch an act
    That blurs the grace and blush of modesty;
    Calls virtue hypocrite; takes off the
 rose
    From the fair forehead of an innocent love,
    And sets a blister there; makes marriage
 vows
    As false as dicers' oaths. O, such a deed
    As from the body of contraction plucks
  
  The very soul, and sweet religion makes
    A rhapsody of words! Heaven's face doth glow;
    Ye
a, this solidity and compound mass,
    With tristful visage, as against the doom,
    Is thought-
sick at the act.
  Queen. Ah me, what act,
    That roars so loud and thunders in the index?
  Ha
m. Look here upon th's picture, and on this,
    The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
    
See what a grace was seated on this brow;
    Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
    An 
eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
    A station like the herald Mercury
    New lighted on a
 heaven-kissing hill:
    A combination and a form indeed
    Where every god did seem to set his 
seal
    To give the world assurance of a man.
    This was your husband. Look you now what follow
s.
    Here is your husband, like a mildew'd ear
    Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes
?
    Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
    And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eye
s
    You cannot call it love; for at your age
    The heyday in the blood is tame, it's humble,

    And waits upon the judgment; and what judgment
    Would step from this to this? Sense sure you
 have,
    Else could you not have motion; but sure that sense
    Is apoplex'd; for madness would
 not err,
    Nor sense to ecstacy was ne'er so thrall'd
    But it reserv'd some quantity of choi
ce
    To serve in such a difference. What devil was't
    That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-b
lind?
    Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
    Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sa
ns all,
    Or but a sickly part of one true sense
    Could not so mope.
    O shame! where is t
hy blush? Rebellious hell,
    If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
    To flaming youth let 
virtue be as wax
    And melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame
    When the compulsive ardour gi
ves the charge,
    Since frost itself as actively doth burn,
    And reason panders will.
  Quee
n. O Hamlet, speak no more!
    Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul,
    And there I see such
 black and grained spots
    As will not leave their tinct.
  Ham. Nay, but to live
    In the ra
nk sweat of an enseamed bed,
    Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love
    Over the nasty
 sty!
  Queen. O, speak to me no more!
    These words like daggers enter in mine ears.
    No mo
re, sweet Hamlet!
  Ham. A murtherer and a villain!
    A slave that is not twentieth part the tit
he
    Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
    A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
    Th
at from a shelf the precious diadem stole
    And put it in his pocket!
  Queen. No more!

     
           Enter the Ghost in his nightgown.

  Ham. A king of shreds and patches!-
    Save me a
nd hover o'er me with your wings,
    You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?
  Quee
n. Alas, he's mad!
  Ham. Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
    That, laps'd in time and pa
ssion, lets go by
    Th' important acting of your dread command?
    O, say!
  Ghost. Do not for
get. This visitation
    Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
    But look, amazement on thy
 mother sits.
    O, step between her and her fighting soul
    Conceit in weakest bodies stronges
t works.
    Speak to her, Hamlet.
  Ham. How is it with you, lady?
  Queen. Alas, how is't with 
you,
    That you do bend your eye on vacancy,
    And with th' encorporal air do hold discourse?

    Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
    And, as the sleeping soldiers in th' alarm,

    Your bedded hairs, like life in excrements,
    Start up and stand an end. O gentle son,
    U
pon the heat and flame of thy distemper
    Sprinkle cool patience! Whereon do you look?
  Ham. On
 him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!
    His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,

    Would make them capable.- Do not look upon me,
    Lest with this piteous action you convert
 
   My stern effects. Then what I have to do
    Will want true colour- tears perchance for blood.

  Queen. To whom do you speak this?
  Ham. Do you see nothing there?
  Queen. Nothing at all; yet 
all that is I see.
  Ham. Nor did you nothing hear?
  Queen. No, nothing but ourselves.
  Ham. Wh
y, look you there! Look how it steals away!
    My father, in his habit as he liv'd!
    Look wher
e he goes even now out at the portal!
                                                     Exit Gho
st.
  Queen. This is the very coinage of your brain.
    This bodiless creation ecstasy
    Is ve
ry cunning in.
  Ham. Ecstasy?
    My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time
    And makes as 
healthful music. It is not madness
    That I have utt'red. Bring me to the test,
    And I the ma
tter will reword; which madness
    Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
    Lay not that
 flattering unction to your soul
    That not your trespass but my madness speaks.
    It will but
 skin and film the ulcerous place,
    Whiles rank corruption, mining all within,
    Infects unse
en. Confess yourself to heaven;
    Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
    And do not spre
ad the compost on the weeds
    To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;
    For in the fat
ness of these pursy times
    Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg-
    Yea, curb and woo for lea
ve to do him good.
  Queen. O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
  Ham. O, throw away the 
worser part of it,
    And live the purer with the other half,
    Good night- but go not to my un
cle's bed.
    Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
    That monster, custom, who all sense doth e
at
    Of habits evil, is angel yet in this,
    That to the use of actions fair and good
    He 
likewise gives a frock or livery,
    That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,
    And that shall l
end a kind of easiness
    To the next abstinence; the next more easy;
    For use almost can chan
ge the stamp of nature,
    And either [master] the devil, or throw him out
    With wondrous pote
ncy. Once more, good night;
    And when you are desirous to be blest,
    I'll blessing beg of yo
u.- For this same lord,
    I do repent; but heaven hath pleas'd it so,
    To punish me with this
, and this with me,
    That I must be their scourge and minister.
    I will bestow him, and will
 answer well
    The death I gave him. So again, good night.
    I must be cruel, only to be kind;

    Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.
    One word more, good lady.
  Queen. What shall
 I do?
  Ham. Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
    Let the bloat King tempt you again to 
bed;
    Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
    And let him, for a pair of reechy kis
ses,
    Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,
    Make you to ravel all this matter o
ut,
    That I essentially am not in madness,
    But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;

    For who that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
    Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib
  
  Such dear concernings hide? Who would do so?
    No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
    Unpeg 
the basket on the house's top,
    Let the birds fly, and like the famous ape,
    To try conclusi
ons, in the basket creep
    And break your own neck down.
  Queen. Be thou assur'd, if words be m
ade of breath,
    And breath of life, I have no life to breathe
    What thou hast said to me.
 
 Ham. I must to England; you know that?
  Queen. Alack,
    I had forgot! 'Tis so concluded on.
 
 Ham. There's letters seal'd; and my two schoolfellows,
    Whom I will trust as I will adders fang
'd,
    They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way
    And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;

    For 'tis the sport to have the enginer
    Hoist with his own petar; and 't shall go hard
   
 But I will delve one yard below their mines
    And blow them at the moon. O, 'tis most sweet
   
 When in one line two crafts directly meet.
    This man shall set me packing.
    I'll lug the gu
ts into the neighbour room.-
    Mother, good night.- Indeed, this counsellor
    Is now most stil
l, most secret, and most grave,
    Who was in life a foolish peating knave.
    Come, sir, to dra
w toward an end with you.
    Good night, mother.
                  [Exit the Queen. Then] Exit Ha
mlet, tugging in
                                                       Polonius.

ACT IV. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King and Queen, with Rosencrantz and 
Guildenstern.

  King. There's matter in these sighs. These profound heaves
    You must translat
e; 'tis fit we understand them.
    Where is your son?
  Queen. Bestow this place on us a little w
hile.
                          [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
    Ah, mine own lord, what
 have I seen to-night!
  King. What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
  Queen. Mad as the sea and wind w
hen both contend
    Which is the mightier. In his lawless fit
    Behind the arras hearing someth
ing stir,
    Whips out his rapier, cries 'A rat, a rat!'
    And in this brainish apprehension ki
lls
    The unseen good old man.
  King. O heavy deed!
    It had been so with us, had we been th
ere.
    His liberty is full of threats to all-
    To you yourself, to us, to every one.
    Ala
s, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
    It will be laid to us, whose providence
    Should 
have kept short, restrain'd, and out of haunt
    This mad young man. But so much was our love
   
 We would not understand what was most fit,
    But, like the owner of a foul disease,
    To keep
 it from divulging, let it feed
    Even on the pith of life. Where is he gone?
  Queen. To draw a
part the body he hath kill'd;
    O'er whom his very madness, like some ore
    Among a mineral of
 metals base,
    Shows itself pure. He weeps for what is done.
  King. O Gertrude, come away!
  
  The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch
    But we will ship him hence; and this vile deed
 
   We must with all our majesty and skill
    Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!

   
          Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

    Friends both, go join you with some further aid
.
    Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
    And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him.

    Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body
    Into the chapel. I pray you haste in this
.
                          Exeunt [Rosencrantz and Guildenstern].
    Come, Gertrude, we'll call 
up our wisest friends
    And let them know both what we mean to do
    And what's untimely done. 
[So haply slander-]
    Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter,
    As level as the cannon to his
 blank,
    Transports his poisoned shot- may miss our name
    And hit the woundless air.- O, com
e away!
    My soul is full of discord and dismay.
                                               
          Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A passage in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. 
Safely stow'd.
  Gentlemen. (within) Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!
  Ham. But soft! What noise? Who calls o
n Hamlet? O, here they
come.

               Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Ros. What h
ave you done, my lord, with the dead body?
  Ham. Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
  Ros
. Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
    And bear it to the chapel.
  Ham. Do not beli
eve it.
  Ros. Believe what?
  Ham. That I can keep your counsel, and not mine own. Besides,
to b
e
    demanded of a sponge, what replication should be made by the
son
    of a king?
  Ros. Tak
e you me for a sponge, my lord?
  Ham. Ay, sir; that soaks up the King's countenance, his
rewards,

    his authorities. But such officers do the King best service
in
    the end. He keeps them, l
ike an ape, in the corner of his
jaw;
    first mouth'd, to be last swallowed. When he needs what 
you
have
    glean'd, it is but squeezing you and, sponge, you shall be
dry
    again.
  Ros. I
 understand you not, my lord.
  Ham. I am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.
  
Ros. My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us
to
    the King.
  Ham. The body 
is with the King, but the King is not with the
body.
    The King is a thing-
  Guil. A thing, my
 lord?
  Ham. Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.
                              
                           Exeunt.




Scene III.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter Kin
g.

  King. I have sent to seek him and to find the body.
    How dangerous is it that this man g
oes loose!
    Yet must not we put the strong law on him.
    He's lov'd of the distracted multitu
de,
    Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;
    And where 'tis so, th' offender's scou
rge is weigh'd,
    But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,
    This sudden sending hi
m away must seem
    Deliberate pause. Diseases desperate grown
    By desperate appliance are rel
iev'd,
    Or not at all.

                    Enter Rosencrantz.

    How now O What hath befa
ll'n?
  Ros. Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
    We cannot get from him.
  King. But wh
ere is he?
  Ros. Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
  King. Bring him before us.

  Ros. Ho, Guildenstern! Bring in my lord.

        Enter Hamlet and Guildenstern [with Attendants
].

  King. Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
  Ham. At supper.
  King. At supper? Where?
  Ham. N
ot where he eats, but where he is eaten. A certain
    convocation of politic worms are e'en at him
. Your worm is
your
    only emperor for diet. We fat all creatures else to fat us,
and
    we f
at ourselves for maggots. Your fat king and your lean
beggar
    is but variable service- two dish
es, but to one table. That's
the
    end.
  King. Alas, alas!
  Ham. A man may fish with the wor
m that hath eat of a king, and
eat
    of the fish that hath fed of that worm.
  King. What dost 
thou mean by this?
  Ham. Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress
through
    the gu
ts of a beggar.
  King. Where is Polonius?
  Ham. In heaven. Send thither to see. If your messenge
r find him
not
    there, seek him i' th' other place yourself. But indeed, if
you
    find him 
not within this month, you shall nose him as you go
up
    the stair, into the lobby.
  King. Go 
seek him there. [To Attendants.]
  Ham. He will stay till you come.
                              
              [Exeunt Attendants.]
  King. Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,-
    Whic
h we do tender as we dearly grieve
    For that which thou hast done,- must send thee hence
    Wi
th fiery quickness. Therefore prepare thyself.
    The bark is ready and the wind at help,
    Th'
 associates tend, and everything is bent
    For England.
  Ham. For England?
  King. Ay, Hamlet.

  Ham. Good.
  King. So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
  Ham. I see a cherub that sees the
m. But come, for England!
    Farewell, dear mother.
  King. Thy loving father, Hamlet.
  Ham. My
 mother! Father and mother is man and wife; man and wife
is
    one flesh; and so, my mother. Come
, for England!
Exit.
  King. Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard.
    Delay it not; I
'll have him hence to-night.
    Away! for everything is seal'd and done
    That else leans on th
' affair. Pray you make haste.
                            Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]
  
  And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught,-
    As my great power thereof may give thee sens
e,
    Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
    After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
   
 Pays homage to us,- thou mayst not coldly set
    Our sovereign process, which imports at full,
 
   By letters congruing to that effect,
    The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;
    For l
ike the hectic in my blood he rages,
    And thou must cure me. Till I know 'tis done,
    Howe'er
 my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.             Exit.

Scene IV.
Near Elsinore.


Enter Fortinbras with his Army over the stage.

  For. Go, Captain, from me greet the Danish k
ing.
    Tell him that by his license Fortinbras
    Craves the conveyance of a promis'd march
  
  Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.
    If that his Majesty would aught with us,
    We s
hall express our duty in his eye;
    And let him know so.
  Capt. I will do't, my lord.
  For. G
o softly on.
                                   Exeunt [all but the Captain].

       Enter Hamle
t, Rosencrantz, [Guildenstern,] and others.

  Ham. Good sir, whose powers are these?
  Capt. The
y are of Norway, sir.
  Ham. How purpos'd, sir, I pray you?
  Capt. Against some part of Poland.

  Ham. Who commands them, sir?
  Capt. The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.
  Ham. Goes it agains
t the main of Poland, sir,
    Or for some frontier?
  Capt. Truly to speak, and with no addition,

    We go to gain a little patch of ground
    That hath in it no profit but the name.
    To pa
y five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
    Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
    A ranker
 rate, should it be sold in fee.
  Ham. Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
  Capt. Yes, it
 is already garrison'd.
  Ham. Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
    Will not debate t
he question of this straw.
    This is th' imposthume of much wealth and peace,
    That inward br
eaks, and shows no cause without
    Why the man dies.- I humbly thank you, sir.
  Capt. God b' wi
' you, sir.                             [Exit.]
  Ros. Will't please you go, my lord?
  Ham. I'll 
be with you straight. Go a little before.
                                        [Exeunt all but H
amlet.]
    How all occasions do inform against me
    And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
 
   If his chief good and market of his time
    Be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.
    Su
re he that made us with such large discourse,
    Looking before and after, gave us not
    That c
apability and godlike reason
    To fust in us unus'd. Now, whether it be
    Bestial oblivion, or
 some craven scruple
    Of thinking too precisely on th' event,-
    A thought which, quarter'd, 
hath but one part wisdom
    And ever three parts coward,- I do not know
    Why yet I live to say
 'This thing's to do,'
    Sith I have cause, and will, and strength, and means
    To do't. Examp
les gross as earth exhort me.
    Witness this army of such mass and charge,
    Led by a delicate
 and tender prince,
    Whose spirit, with divine ambition puff'd,
    Makes mouths at the invisib
le event,
    Exposing what is mortal and unsure
    To all that fortune, death, and danger dare,

    Even for an eggshell. Rightly to be great
    Is not to stir without great argument,
    But 
greatly to find quarrel in a straw
    When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,
    That have
 a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,
    Excitements of my reason and my blood,
    And let all sle
ep, while to my shame I see
    The imminent death of twenty thousand men
    That for a fantasy a
nd trick of fame
    Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot
    Whereon the numbers cannot
 try the cause,
    Which is not tomb enough and continent
    To hide the slain? O, from this tim
e forth,
    My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!            Exit.

Scen
e V.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter Horatio, Queen, and a Gentleman.

  Queen. I will n
ot speak with her.
  Gent. She is importunate, indeed distract.
    Her mood will needs be pitied.

  Queen. What would she have?
  Gent. She speaks much of her father; says she hears
    There's 
tricks i' th' world, and hems, and beats her heart;
    Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things i
n doubt,
    That carry but half sense. Her speech is nothing,
    Yet the unshaped use of it doth
 move
    The hearers to collection; they aim at it,
    And botch the words up fit to their own t
houghts;
    Which, as her winks and nods and gestures yield them,
    Indeed would make one think
 there might be thought,
    Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
  Hor. 'Twere good she were 
spoken with; for she may strew
    Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.
  Queen. Let her c
ome in.
                                               [Exit Gentleman.]
    [Aside] To my sick so
ul (as sin's true nature is)
    Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
    So full of artle
ss jealousy is guilt
    It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.

                 Enter Ophelia
 distracted.

  Oph. Where is the beauteous Majesty of Denmark?
  Queen. How now, Ophelia?
  Oph
. (sings)
         How should I your true-love know
           From another one?
         By his 
cockle bat and' staff
           And his sandal shoon.

  Queen. Alas, sweet lady, what imports t
his song?
  Oph. Say you? Nay, pray You mark.

    (Sings) He is dead and gone, lady,
          
    He is dead and gone;
            At his head a grass-green turf,
              At his heels a 
stone.

    O, ho!
  Queen. Nay, but Ophelia-
  Oph. Pray you mark.

    (Sings) White his shr
oud as the mountain snow-

                    Enter King.

  Queen. Alas, look here, my lord!

  Oph. (Sings)
           Larded all with sweet flowers;
         Which bewept to the grave did no
t go
           With true-love showers.

  King. How do you, pretty lady?
  Oph. Well, God dild 
you! They say the owl was a baker's
daughter.
    Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we 
may be. God
be at
    your table!
  King. Conceit upon her father.
  Oph. Pray let's have no wor
ds of this; but when they ask, you
what
    it means, say you this:

    (Sings) To-morrow is Sa
int Valentine's day,
              All in the morning bedtime,
            And I a maid at your wi
ndow,
              To be your Valentine.

            Then up he rose and donn'd his clo'es
   
           And dupp'd the chamber door,
            Let in the maid, that out a maid
             
 Never departed more.

  King. Pretty Ophelia!
  Oph. Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an e
nd on't!

    [Sings] By Gis and by Saint Charity,
              Alack, and fie for shame!
     
       Young men will do't if they come to't
              By Cock, they are to blame.

         
   Quoth she, 'Before you tumbled me,
              You promis'd me to wed.'

    He answers:


            'So would I 'a' done, by yonder sun,
              An thou hadst not come to my bed.'


  King. How long hath she been thus?
  Oph. I hope all will be well. We must be patient; but I ca
nnot
    choose but weep to think they would lay him i' th' cold
ground.
    My brother shall kno
w of it; and so I thank you for your good
    counsel. Come, my coach! Good night, ladies. Good nig
ht,
sweet
    ladies. Good night, good night.                         Exit
  King. Follow her clo
se; give her good watch, I pray you.
                                                 [Exit Horatio
.]

    O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs
    All from her father's death. O Gertru
de, Gertrude,
    When sorrows come, they come not single spies.
    But in battalions! First, her
 father slain;
    Next, your son gone, and he most violent author
    Of his own just remove; the
 people muddied,
    Thick and and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers
    For good Poloniu
s' death, and we have done but greenly
    In hugger-mugger to inter him; poor Ophelia
    Divided
 from herself and her fair judgment,
    Without the which we are pictures or mere beasts;
    Las
t, and as much containing as all these,
    Her brother is in secret come from France;
    And wan
ts not buzzers to infect his ear
    Feeds on his wonder, keep, himself in clouds,
    With pestil
ent speeches of his father's death,
    Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
    Will nothing st
ick our person to arraign
    In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
    Like to a murd'ring pi
ece, in many places
    Give me superfluous death.                  A noise within.
  Queen. Alack
, what noise is this?
  King. Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.

                  
   Enter a Messenger.

    What is the matter?
  Mess. Save Yourself, my lord:
    The ocean, ov
erpeering of his list,
    Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
    Than Young Laertes, in
 a riotous head,
    O'erbears Your offices. The rabble call him lord;
    And, as the world were 
now but to begin,
    Antiquity forgot, custom not known,
    The ratifiers and props of every wor
d,
    They cry 'Choose we! Laertes shall be king!'
    Caps, hands, and tongues applaud it to the
 clouds,
    'Laertes shall be king! Laertes king!'
                                              
   A noise within.
  Queen. How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!
    O, this is counter, yo
u false Danish dogs!
  King. The doors are broke.

                    Enter Laertes with others.


  Laer. Where is this king?- Sirs, staid you all without.
  All. No, let's come in!
  Laer. I 
pray you give me leave.
  All. We will, we will!
  Laer. I thank you. Keep the door.      [Exeunt 
his Followers.]
    O thou vile king,
    Give me my father!
  Queen. Calmly, good Laertes.
  La
er. That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard;
    Cries cuckold to my father; brands the
 harlot
    Even here between the chaste unsmirched brows
    Of my true mother.
  King. What is 
the cause, Laertes,
    That thy rebellion looks so giantlike?
    Let him go, Gertrude. Do not fe
ar our person.
    There's such divinity doth hedge a king
    That treason can but peep to what i
t would,
    Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,
    Why thou art thus incens'd. Let him go
, Gertrude.
    Speak, man.
  Laer. Where is my father?
  King. Dead.
  Queen. But not by him!

  King. Let him demand his fill.
  Laer. How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
    To hell, 
allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil
    Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
    I da
re damnation. To this point I stand,
    That both the world, I give to negligence,
    Let come w
hat comes; only I'll be reveng'd
    Most throughly for my father.
  King. Who shall stay you?
  
Laer. My will, not all the world!
    And for my means, I'll husband them so well
    They shall g
o far with little.
  King. Good Laertes,
    If you desire to know the certainty
    Of your dear
 father's death, is't writ in your revenge
    That sweepstake you will draw both friend and foe,

    Winner and loser?
  Laer. None but his enemies.
  King. Will you know them then?
  Laer. To h
is good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms
    And, like the kind life-rend'ring pelican,
    Repa
st them with my blood.
  King. Why, now You speak
    Like a good child and a true gentleman.
   
 That I am guiltless of your father's death,
    And am most sensibly in grief for it,
    It shal
l as level to your judgment pierce
    As day does to your eye.
                              A no
ise within: 'Let her come in.'
  Laer. How now? What noise is that?

                      Enter 
Ophelia.

    O heat, dry up my brains! Tears seven times salt
    Burn out the sense and virtue 
of mine eye!
    By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight
    Till our scale turn the beam. 
O rose of May!
    Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
    O heavens! is't possible a young mai
d's wits
    Should be as mortal as an old man's life?
    Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis 
fine,
    It sends some precious instance of itself
    After the thing it loves.

  Oph. (sings
)
         They bore him barefac'd on the bier
           (Hey non nony, nony, hey nony)
        
 And in his grave rain'd many a tear.

    Fare you well, my dove!
  Laer. Hadst thou thy wits, a
nd didst persuade revenge,
    It could not move thus.
  Oph. You must sing 'A-down a-down, and yo
u call him a-down-a.'
O,
    how the wheel becomes it! It is the false steward, that stole
his
 
   master's daughter.
  Laer. This nothing's more than matter.
  Oph. There's rosemary, that's for
 remembrance. Pray you, love,
    remember. And there is pansies, that's for thoughts.
  Laer. A d
ocument in madness! Thoughts and remembrance fitted.
  Oph. There's fennel for you, and columbines.
 There's rue for
you,
    and here's some for me. We may call it herb of grace o'
Sundays.
    O
, you must wear your rue with a difference! There's a daisy.
I
    would give you some violets, bu
t they wither'd all when my
father
    died. They say he made a good end.

    [Sings] For bonny
 sweet Robin is all my joy.

  Laer. Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,
    She turns 
to favour and to prettiness.
  Oph. (sings)
         And will he not come again?
         And wil
l he not come again?
           No, no, he is dead;
           Go to thy deathbed;
         He ne
ver will come again.

         His beard was as white as snow,
         All flaxen was his poll.

           He is gone, he is gone,
           And we cast away moan.
         God 'a'mercy on his
 soul!

    And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God b' wi' you.
Exit.
  Laer. Do you see thi
s, O God?
  King. Laertes, I must commune with your grief,
    Or you deny me right. Go but apart,

    Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will,
    And they shall hear and judge 'twixt yo
u and me.
    If by direct or by collateral hand
    They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom giv
e,
    Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours,
    To you in satisfaction; but if not,
  
  Be you content to lend your patience to us,
    And we shall jointly labour with your soul
    T
o give it due content.
  Laer. Let this be so.
    His means of death, his obscure funeral-
    N
o trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,
    No noble rite nor formal ostentation,-
    Cry 
to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
    That I must call't in question.
  King. So you sh
all;
    And where th' offence is let the great axe fall.
    I pray you go with me.
            
                                              Exeunt

Scene VI.
Elsinore. Anoth
er room in the Castle.

Enter Horatio with an Attendant.

  Hor. What are they that would speak 
with me?
  Servant. Seafaring men, sir. They say they have letters for
you.
  Hor. Let them come 
in.
                                               [Exit Attendant.]
    I do not know from what p

    I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.

                          Ent
er Sailors.

  Sailor. God bless you, sir.
  Hor. Let him bless thee too.
  Sailor. 'A shall, si
r, an't please him. There's a letter for
you,
    sir,- it comes from th' ambassador that was boun
d for
England- if
    your name be Horatio, as I am let to know it is.
  Hor. (reads the letter) 
'Horatio, when thou shalt have
overlook'd
    this, give these fellows some means to the King. The
y have
    letters for him. Ere we were two days old at sea, a pirate of

    very warlike appoin
tment gave us chase. Finding ourselves too
    slow of sail, we put on a compelled valour, and in t
he
grapple I
    boarded them. On the instant they got clear of our ship; so I
    alone became t
heir prisoner. They have dealt with me like
thieves
    of mercy; but they knew what they did: I a
m to do a good turn
for
    them. Let the King have the letters I have sent, and repair
thou
   
 to me with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death. I have
words
    to speak in thine ear will m
ake thee dumb; yet are they much
too
    light for the bore of the matter. These good fellows will

bring
    thee where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their
course
    for England. Of t
hem I have much to tell thee. Farewell.
                            'He that thou knowest thine, HA
MLET.'

    Come, I will give you way for these your letters,
    And do't the speedier that you 
may direct me
    To him from whom you brought them.                   Exeunt.

Scene VII.
Elsinore. Another room in the Castle.

Enter King and Laertes.

  King. Now must yo
ur conscience my acquittance seal,
    And You must put me in your heart for friend,
    Sith you 
have heard, and with a knowing ear,
    That he which hath your noble father slain
    Pursued my 
life.
  Laer. It well appears. But tell me
    Why you proceeded not against these feats
    So c
rimeful and so capital in nature,
    As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
    You mainly w
ere stirr'd up.
  King. O, for two special reasons,
    Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsin
ew'd,
    But yet to me they are strong. The Queen his mother
    Lives almost by his looks; and f
or myself,-
    My virtue or my plague, be it either which,-
    She's so conjunctive to my life a
nd soul
    That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
    I could not but by her. The other m
otive
    Why to a public count I might not go
    Is the great love the general gender bear him,

    Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
    Would, like the spring that turneth wood t
o stone,
    Convert his gives to graces; so that my arrows,
    Too slightly timber'd for so loud
 a wind,
    Would have reverted to my bow again,
    And not where I had aim'd them.
  Laer. And
 so have I a noble father lost;
    A sister driven into desp'rate terms,
    Whose worth, if prai
ses may go back again,
    Stood challenger on mount of all the age
    For her perfections. But m
y revenge will come.
  King. Break not your sleeps for that. You must not think
    That we are ma
de of stuff so flat and dull
    That we can let our beard be shook with danger,
    And think it 
pastime. You shortly shall hear more.
    I lov'd your father, and we love ourself,
    And that, 
I hope, will teach you to imagine-

                 Enter a Messenger with letters.

    How no
w? What news?
  Mess. Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:
    This to your Majesty; this to the Queen.

  King. From Hamlet? Who brought them?
  Mess. Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not.
    Th
ey were given me by Claudio; he receiv'd them
    Of him that brought them.
  King. Laertes, you s
hall hear them.
    Leave us.
                                                 Exit Messenger.
  
  [Reads]'High and Mighty,-You shall know I am set naked on
your
    kingdom. To-morrow shall I be
g leave to see your kingly eyes;
    when I shall (first asking your pardon thereunto) recount the

    occasion of my sudden and more strange return.
                                               
      'HAMLET.'
    What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?
    Or is it some abuse, an
d no such thing?
  Laer. Know you the hand?
  King. 'Tis Hamlet's character. 'Naked!'
    And in 
a postscript here, he says 'alone.'
    Can you advise me?
  Laer. I am lost in it, my lord. But l
et him come!
    It warms the very sickness in my heart
    That I shall live and tell him to his 
teeth,
    'Thus didest thou.'
  King. If it be so, Laertes
    (As how should it be so? how othe
rwise?),
    Will you be rul'd by me?
  Laer. Ay my lord,
    So you will not o'errule me to a pe
ace.
  King. To thine own peace. If he be now return'd
    As checking at his voyage, and that he 
means
    No more to undertake it, I will work him
    To exploit now ripe in my device,
    Unde
r the which he shall not choose but fall;
    And for his death no wind shall breathe
    But even
 his mother shall uncharge the practice
    And call it accident.
  Laer. My lord, I will be rul'd
;
    The rather, if you could devise it so
    That I might be the organ.
  King. It falls right
.
    You have been talk'd of since your travel much,
    And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a qual
ity
    Wherein they say you shine, Your sum of parts
    Did not together pluck such envy from hi
m
    As did that one; and that, in my regard,
    Of the unworthiest siege.
  Laer. What part is
 that, my lord?
  King. A very riband in the cap of youth-
    Yet needfull too; for youth no less
 becomes
    The light and careless livery that it wears
    Than settled age his sables and his w
eeds,
    Importing health and graveness. Two months since
    Here was a gentleman of Normandy.

    I have seen myself, and serv'd against, the French,
    And they can well on horseback; but thi
s gallant
    Had witchcraft in't. He grew unto his seat,
    And to such wondrous doing brought h
is horse
    As had he been incorps'd and demi-natur'd
    With the brave beast. So far he topp'd 
my thought
    That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
    Come short of what he did.
  Laer. A 
Norman was't?
  King. A Norman.
  Laer. Upon my life, Lamound.
  King. The very same.
  Laer. I 
know him well. He is the broach indeed
    And gem of all the nation.
  King. He made confession o
f you;
    And gave you such a masterly report
    For art and exercise in your defence,
    And 
for your rapier most especially,
    That he cried out 'twould be a sight indeed
    If one could 
match you. The scrimers of their nation
    He swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
    If yo
u oppos'd them. Sir, this report of his
    Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
    That he could 
nothing do but wish and beg
    Your sudden coming o'er to play with you.
    Now, out of this-
 
 Laer. What out of this, my lord?
  King. Laertes, was your father dear to you?
    Or are you lik
e the painting of a sorrow,
    A face without a heart,'
  Laer. Why ask you this?
  King. Not th
at I think you did not love your father;
    But that I know love is begun by time,
    And that I
 see, in passages of proof,
    Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
    There lives within th
e very flame of love
    A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
    And nothing is at a like 
goodness still;
    For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
    Dies in his own too-much. That we woul
d do,
    We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes,
    And hath abatements and delays
 as many
    As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
    And then this 'should' is like a 
spendthrift sigh,
    That hurts by easing. But to the quick o' th' ulcer!
    Hamlet comes back. 
What would you undertake
    To show yourself your father's son in deed
    More than in words?
 
 Laer. To cut his throat i' th' church!
  King. No place indeed should murther sanctuarize;
    Re
venge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,
    Will you do this? Keep close within your chambe
r.
    Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home.
    We'll put on those shall praise your exce
llence
    And set a double varnish on the fame
    The Frenchman gave you; bring you in fine toge
ther
    And wager on your heads. He, being remiss,
    Most generous, and free from all contrivin
g,
    Will not peruse the foils; so that with ease,
    Or with a little shuffling, you may choos
e
    A sword unbated, and, in a pass of practice,
    Requite him for your father.
  Laer. I wil
l do't!
    And for that purpose I'll anoint my sword.
    I bought an unction of a mountebank,
 
   So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
    Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
    Colle
cted from all simples that have virtue
    Under the moon, can save the thing from death
    This 
is but scratch'd withal. I'll touch my point
    With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,

    It may be death.
  King. Let's further think of this,
    Weigh what convenience both of tim
e and means
    May fit us to our shape. If this should fall,
    And that our drift look through 
our bad performance.
    'Twere better not assay'd. Therefore this project
    Should have a back 
or second, that might hold
    If this did blast in proof. Soft! let me see.
    We'll make a sole
mn wager on your cunnings-
    I ha't!
    When in your motion you are hot and dry-
    As make y
our bouts more violent to that end-
    And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepar'd him
    A 
chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,
    If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
    Our
 purpose may hold there.- But stay, what noise,

                           Enter Queen.

    Ho
w now, sweet queen?
  Queen. One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
    So fast they follow. Your
 sister's drown'd, Laertes.
  Laer. Drown'd! O, where?
  Queen. There is a willow grows aslant a b
rook,
    That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream.
    There with fantastic garlands did s
he come
    Of crowflowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,
    That liberal shepherds give a 
grosser name,
    But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them.
    There on the pendant bou
ghs her coronet weeds
    Clamb'ring to hang, an envious sliver broke,
    When down her weedy tro
phies and herself
    Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide
    And, mermaid-like, aw
hile they bore her up;
    Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes,
    As one incapable of 
her own distress,
    Or like a creature native and indued
    Unto that element; but long it coul
d not be
    Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
    Pull'd the poor wretch from her m
elodious lay
    To muddy death.
  Laer. Alas, then she is drown'd?
  Queen. Drown'd, drown'd.
 
 Laer. Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
    And therefore I forbid my tears; but yet
   
 It is our trick; nature her custom holds,
    Let shame say what it will. When these are gone,
  
  The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord.
    I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze
    Bu
t that this folly douts it.                          Exit.
  King. Let's follow, Gertrude.
    How
 much I had to do to calm his rage I
    Now fear I this will give it start again;
    Therefore l
et's follow.
                                                         Exeunt.

ACT V. Scene I.
Elsinore. A churchyard.

Enter two Clowns, [with spades and pickaxes].

  Clown
. Is she to be buried in Christian burial when she
wilfully
    seeks her own salvation?
  Other.
 I tell thee she is; therefore make her grave straight.
    The crowner hath sate on her, and finds
 it Christian burial.
  Clown. How can that be, unless she drown'd herself in her own
    defence?

  Other. Why, 'tis found so.
  Clown. It must be se offendendo; it cannot be else. For here
lies

    the point: if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act; and
an
    act hath three branches
-it is to act, to do, and to perform;
    argal, she drown'd herself wittingly.
  Other. Nay, but 
hear you, Goodman Delver!
  Clown. Give me leave. Here lies the water; good. Here stands
the
    
man; good. If the man go to this water and drown himself, it
is,
    will he nill he, he goes- mar
k you that. But if the water
come to
    him and drown him, he drowns not himself. Argal, he that 
is
not
    guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.
  Other. But is this law?
  Clown.
 Ay, marry, is't- crowner's quest law.
  Other. Will you ha' the truth an't? If this had not been a

    gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o' Christian
burial.
  Clown. Why, there thou s
ay'st! And the more pity that great
folk
    should have count'nance in this world to drown or han
g
themselves
    more than their even-Christian. Come, my spade! There is no
    ancient gentleme
n but gard'ners, ditchers, and grave-makers.
They
    hold up Adam's profession.
  Other. Was he 
a gentleman?
  Clown. 'A was the first that ever bore arms.
  Other. Why, he had none.
  Clown. W
hat, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the
Scripture?
    The Scripture says Adam digg'd. Co
uld he dig without arms?
I'll
    put another question to thee. If thou answerest me not to the
 
   purpose, confess thyself-
  Other. Go to!
  Clown. What is he that builds stronger than either 
the mason,
the
    shipwright, or the carpenter?
  Other. The gallows-maker; for that frame outli
ves a thousand
    tenants.
  Clown. I like thy wit well, in good faith. The gallows does
well.

    But how does it well? It does well to those that do ill. Now,
    thou dost ill to say the gall
ows is built stronger than the
    church. Argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To't again,
com
e!
  Other. Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a
    carpenter?
  Clown. Ay, tell
 me that, and unyoke.
  Other. Marry, now I can tell!
  Clown. To't.
  Other. Mass, I cannot tell
.

                 Enter Hamlet and Horatio afar off.

  Clown. Cudgel thy brains no more about
 it, for your dull ass
will
    not mend his pace with beating; and when you are ask'd this
    q
uestion next, say 'a grave-maker.' The houses he makes lasts
    till doomsday. Go, get thee to Yau
ghan; fetch me a stoup of
    liquor.
                                            [Exit Second Clo
wn.]


                       [Clown digs and] sings.

       In youth when I did love, did lov
e,
         Methought it was very sweet;
       To contract- O- the time for- a- my behove,
     
    O, methought there- a- was nothing- a- meet.

  Ham. Has this fellow no feeling of his busines
s, that he sings
at
    grave-making?
  Hor. Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.

  Ham. 'Tis e'en so. The hand of little employment hath the
daintier
    sense.
  Clown. (sings)

         But age with his stealing steps
           Hath clawed me in his clutch,
         And ha
th shipped me intil the land,
           As if I had never been such.
                            
                [Throws up a skull.]

  Ham. That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once. H
ow
the
    knave jowls it to the ground,as if 'twere Cain's jawbone,
that
    did the first murt
her! This might be the pate of a
Politician,
    which this ass now o'erreaches; one that would ci
rcumvent
God,
    might it not?
  Hor. It might, my lord.
  Ham. Or of a courtier, which could s
ay 'Good morrow, sweet
lord!
    How dost thou, good lord?' This might be my Lord Such-a-one,
tha
t
    prais'd my Lord Such-a-one's horse when he meant to beg it-
might
    it not?
  Hor. Ay, m
y lord.
  Ham. Why, e'en so! and now my Lady Worm's, chapless, and
knock'd
    about the mazzard 
with a sexton's spade. Here's fine
revolution,
    and we had the trick to see't. Did these bones 
cost no more
the
    breeding but to play at loggets with 'em? Mine ache to think
    on't.
  Cl
own. (Sings)
         A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,
           For and a shrouding sheet;
     
    O, a Pit of clay for to be made
           For such a guest is meet.
                         
             Throws up [another skull].

  Ham. There's another. Why may not that be the skull of 
a
lawyer?
    Where be his quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, his
tenures,
    and his trick
s? Why does he suffer this rude knave now to
knock
    him about the sconce with a dirty shovel, a
nd will not tell
him
    of his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be in's time
a
    gre
at buyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizances,
his
    fines, his double vouchers, his re
coveries. Is this the fine
of
    his fines, and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his
fine

    pate full of fine dirt? Will his vouchers vouch him no more
of
    his purchases, and double
 ones too, than the length and
breadth
    of a pair of indentures? The very conveyances of his la
nds
will
    scarcely lie in this box; and must th' inheritor himself have
no
    more, ha?
  H
or. Not a jot more, my lord.
  Ham. Is not parchment made of sheepskins?
  Hor. Ay, my lord, And o
f calveskins too.
  Ham. They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in
that. I
    will s
peak to this fellow. Whose grave's this, sirrah?
  Clown. Mine, sir.

    [Sings] O, a pit of cla
y for to be made
              For such a guest is meet.

  Ham. I think it be thine indeed, for 
thou liest in't.
  Clown. You lie out on't, sir, and therefore 'tis not yours.
    For my part, I 
do not lie in't, yet it is mine.
  Ham. Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine. 'Tis
f
or
    the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.
  Clown. 'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill a
way again from me to you.
  Ham. What man dost thou dig it for?
  Clown. For no man, sir.
  Ham. 
What woman then?
  Clown. For none neither.
  Ham. Who is to be buried in't?
  Clown. One that wa
s a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's
dead.
  Ham. How absolute the knave is! We must speak by
 the card, or
    equivocation will undo us. By the Lord, Horatio, this three
years
    I have ta
ken note of it, the age is grown so picked that the
toe
    of the peasant comes so near the heel 
of the courtier he
galls
    his kibe.- How long hast thou been a grave-maker?
  Clown. Of all th
e days i' th' year, I came to't that day that
our
    last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.
  Ham
. How long is that since?
  Clown. Cannot you tell that? Every fool can tell that. It was
the
   
 very day that young Hamlet was born- he that is mad, and sent
    into England.
  Ham. Ay, marry,
 why was be sent into England?
  Clown. Why, because 'a was mad. 'A shall recover his wits
there;

    or, if 'a do not, 'tis no great matter there.
  Ham. Why?
  Clown. 'Twill not he seen in him 
there. There the men are as
mad as
    he.
  Ham. How came he mad?
  Clown. Very strangely, they
 say.
  Ham. How strangely?
  Clown. Faith, e'en with losing his wits.
  Ham. Upon what ground?

  Clown. Why, here in Denmark. I have been sexton here, man and
boy
    thirty years.
  Ham. How 
long will a man lie i' th' earth ere he rot?
  Clown. Faith, if 'a be not rotten before 'a die (as 
we have
many
    pocky corses now-a-days that will scarce hold the laying in,
I
    will last yo
u some eight year or nine year. A tanner will
last
    you nine year.
  Ham. Why he more than ano
ther?
  Clown. Why, sir, his hide is so tann'd with his trade that 'a
will
    keep out water a g
reat while; and your water is a sore
decayer of
    your whoreson dead body. Here's a skull now. T
his skull hath
lien
    you i' th' earth three-and-twenty years.
  Ham. Whose was it?
  Clown. A
 whoreson, mad fellow's it was. Whose do you think it
was?
  Ham. Nay, I know not.
  Clown. A pes
tilence on him for a mad rogue! 'A pour'd a flagon
of
    Rhenish on my head once. This same skull
, sir, was Yorick's
    skull, the King's jester.
  Ham. This?
  Clown. E'en that.
  Ham. Let me
 see. [Takes the skull.] Alas, poor Yorick! I knew
him,
    Horatio. A fellow of infinite jest, of
 most excellent fancy.
He
    hath borne me on his back a thousand times. And now how
abhorred
 
   in my imagination it is! My gorge rises at it. Here hung
those
    lips that I have kiss'd I kn
ow not how oft. Where be your
gibes
    now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment t
hat
    were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock
your
    own grinning? Quite c
hap- fall'n? Now get you to my lady's
    chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to th
is
    favour she must come. Make her laugh at that. Prithee,
Horatio,
    tell me one thing.
  
Hor. What's that, my lord?
  Ham. Dost thou think Alexander look'd o' this fashion i' th'
earth?

  Hor. E'en so.
  Ham. And smelt so? Pah!
                                          [Puts down the
 skull.]
  Hor. E'en so, my lord.
  Ham. To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not
  
  imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it
    stopping a bunghole?
  Hor. 'T
were to consider too curiously, to consider so.
  Ham. No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thit
her with
modesty
    enough, and likelihood to lead it; as thus: Alexander died,
    Alexander wa
s buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust
is
    earth; of earth we make loam; and why of 
that loam (whereto
he
    was converted) might they not stop a beer barrel?
    Imperious Caesar,
 dead and turn'd to clay,
    Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.
    O, that that earth whic
h kept the world in awe
    Should patch a wall t' expel the winter's flaw!
    But soft! but soft
! aside! Here comes the King-

    Enter [priests with] a coffin [in funeral procession], King,
 
            Queen, Laertes, with Lords attendant.]

    The Queen, the courtiers. Who is this they
 follow?
    And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken
    The corse they follow did with desp
'rate hand
    Fordo it own life. 'Twas of some estate.
    Couch we awhile, and mark.
          
                               [Retires with Horatio.]

  Laer. What ceremony else?
  Ham. That i
s Laertes,
    A very noble youth. Mark.
  Laer. What ceremony else?
  Priest. Her obsequies have
 been as far enlarg'd
    As we have warranty. Her death was doubtful;
    And, but that great com
mand o'ersways the order,
    She should in ground unsanctified have lodg'd
    Till the last trum
pet. For charitable prayers,
    Shards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on her.
    Yet here
 she is allow'd her virgin rites,
    Her maiden strewments, and the bringing home
    Of bell and
 burial.
  Laer. Must there no more be done?
  Priest. No more be done.
    We should profane the
 service of the dead
    To sing a requiem and such rest to her
    As to peace-parted souls.
  L
aer. Lay her i' th' earth;
    And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
    May violets spring! I te
ll thee, churlish priest,
    A minist'ring angel shall my sister be
    When thou liest howling.

  Ham. What, the fair Ophelia?
  Queen. Sweets to the sweet! Farewell.
                          
                   [Scatters flowers.]
    I hop'd thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
    I
 thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
    And not have strew'd thy grave.
  Laer. O, 
treble woe
    Fall ten times treble on that cursed head
    Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious 
sense
    Depriv'd thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,
    Till I have caught her once more in min
e arms.
                                             Leaps in the grave.
    Now pile your dust up
on the quick and dead
    Till of this flat a mountain you have made
    T' o'ertop old Pelion or 
the skyish head
    Of blue Olympus.
  Ham. [comes forward] What is he whose grief
    Bears such
 an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow
    Conjures the wand'ring stars, and makes them stand
    Li
ke wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,
    Hamlet the Dane.                    [Leaps in after Laert
es.
  Laer. The devil take thy soul!
                                            [Grapples with hi
m].
  Ham. Thou pray'st not well.
    I prithee take thy fingers from my throat;
    For, though 
I am not splenitive and rash,
    Yet have I in me something dangerous,
    Which let thy wisdom f
ear. Hold off thy hand!
  King. Pluck them asunder.
  Queen. Hamlet, Hamlet!
  All. Gentlemen!
 
 Hor. Good my lord, be quiet.
             [The Attendants part them, and they come out of the
   
                                                      grave.]
  Ham. Why, I will fight with him upo
n this theme
    Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
  Queen. O my son, what theme?
  Ham. I lov
'd Ophelia. Forty thousand brothers
    Could not (with all their quantity of love)
    Make up my
 sum. What wilt thou do for her?
  King. O, he is mad, Laertes.
  Queen. For love of God, forbear 
him!
  Ham. 'Swounds, show me what thou't do.
    Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear 
thyself?
    Woo't drink up esill? eat a crocodile?
    I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?

    To outface me with leaping in her grave?
    Be buried quick with her, and so will I.
    And 
if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
    Millions of acres on us, till our ground,
    Singe
ing his pate against the burning zone,
    Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
    I'll 
rant as well as thou.
  Queen. This is mere madness;
    And thus a while the fit will work on him
.
    Anon, as patient as the female dove
    When that her golden couplets are disclos'd,
    Hi
s silence will sit drooping.
  Ham. Hear you, sir!
    What is the reason that you use me thus?
 
   I lov'd you ever. But it is no matter.
    Let Hercules himself do what he may,
    The cat wil
l mew, and dog will have his day.
Exit.
  King. I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.
       
                                            Exit Horatio.
    [To Laertes] Strengthen your patience
 in our last night's
speech.
    We'll put the matter to the present push.-
    Good Gertrude, se
t some watch over your son.-
    This grave shall have a living monument.
    An hour of quiet sho
rtly shall we see;
    Till then in patience our proceeding be.
                                  
                       Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A hall in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet a
nd Horatio.

  Ham. So much for this, sir; now shall you see the other.
    You do remember all t
he circumstance?
  Hor. Remember it, my lord!
  Ham. Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting

    That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay
    Worse than the mutinies in the bilboes. Rash
ly-
    And prais'd be rashness for it; let us know,
    Our indiscretion sometime serves us well

    When our deep plots do pall; and that should learn us
    There's a divinity that shapes our e
nds,
    Rough-hew them how we will-
  Hor. That is most certain.
  Ham. Up from my cabin,
    M
y sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
    Grop'd I to find out them; had my desire,
    Finger'
d their packet, and in fine withdrew
    To mine own room again; making so bold
    (My fears forg
etting manners) to unseal
    Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio
    (O royal knavery!
), an exact command,
    Larded with many several sorts of reasons,
    Importing Denmark's health
, and England's too,
    With, hoo! such bugs and goblins in my life-
    That, on the supervise, 
no leisure bated,
    No, not to stay the finding of the axe,
    My head should be struck off.
 
 Hor. Is't possible?
  Ham. Here's the commission; read it at more leisure.
    But wilt thou bear
 me how I did proceed?
  Hor. I beseech you.
  Ham. Being thus benetted round with villanies,
   
 Or I could make a prologue to my brains,
    They had begun the play. I sat me down;
    Devis'd 
a new commission; wrote it fair.
    I once did hold it, as our statists do,
    A baseness to wri
te fair, and labour'd much
    How to forget that learning; but, sir, now
    It did me yeoman's s
ervice. Wilt thou know
    Th' effect of what I wrote?
  Hor. Ay, good my lord.
  Ham. An earnest
 conjuration from the King,
    As England was his faithful tributary,
    As love between them li
ke the palm might flourish,
    As peace should still her wheaten garland wear
    And stand a com
ma 'tween their amities,
    And many such-like as's of great charge,
    That, on the view and kn
owing of these contents,
    Without debatement further, more or less,
    He should the bearers p
ut to sudden death,
    Not shriving time allow'd.
  Hor. How was this seal'd?
  Ham. Why, even i
n that was heaven ordinant.
    I had my father's signet in my purse,
    Which was the model of t
hat Danish seal;
    Folded the writ up in the form of th' other,
    Subscrib'd it, gave't th' im
pression, plac'd it safely,
    The changeling never known. Now, the next day
    Was our sea-figh
t; and what to this was sequent
    Thou know'st already.
  Hor. So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz g
o to't.
  Ham. Why, man, they did make love to this employment!
    They are not near my conscienc
e; their defeat
    Does by their own insinuation grow.
    'Tis dangerous when the baser nature c
omes
    Between the pass and fell incensed points
    Of mighty opposites.
  Hor. Why, what a ki
ng is this!
  Ham. Does it not, thinks't thee, stand me now upon-
    He that hath kill'd my king,
 and whor'd my mother;
    Popp'd in between th' election and my hopes;
    Thrown out his angle f
or my proper life,
    And with such coz'nage- is't not perfect conscience
    To quit him with th
is arm? And is't not to be damn'd
    To let this canker of our nature come
    In further evil?

  Hor. It must be shortly known to him from England
    What is the issue of the business there.
 
 Ham. It will be short; the interim is mine,
    And a man's life is no more than to say 'one.'
  
  But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
    That to Laertes I forgot myself,
    For by the image of 
my cause I see
    The portraiture of his. I'll court his favours.
    But sure the bravery of his
 grief did put me
    Into a tow'ring passion.
  Hor. Peace! Who comes here?

                 E
nter young Osric, a courtier.

  Osr. Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
  Ham. I hu
mbly thank you, sir. [Aside to Horatio] Dost know this
    waterfly?
  Hor. [aside to Hamlet] No, 
my good lord.
  Ham. [aside to Horatio] Thy state is the more gracious; for
'tis a
    vice to kn
ow him. He hath much land, and fertile. Let a beast
be
    lord of beasts, and his crib shall stan
d at the king's mess.
'Tis
    a chough; but, as I say, spacious in the possession of dirt.

  O
sr. Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should
impart
    a thing to you from his Maje
sty.
  Ham. I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit. Put
your
    bonnet to his righ
t use. 'Tis for the head.
  Osr. I thank your lordship, it is very hot.
  Ham. No, believe me, 'ti
s very cold; the wind is northerly.
  Osr. It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
  Ham. But yet
 methinks it is very sultry and hot for my
complexion.
  Osr. Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sul
try, as 'twere- I
cannot
    tell how. But, my lord, his Majesty bade me signify to you
that
   
 he has laid a great wager on your head. Sir, this is the
matter-
  Ham. I beseech you remember.

                           [Hamlet moves him to put on his hat.]
  Osr. Nay, good my lord; for mine
 ease, in good faith. Sir, here
is
    newly come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute
gentl
eman,
    full of most excellent differences, of very soft society and
    great showing. Indeed, 
to speak feelingly of him, he is the
card
    or calendar of gentry; for you shall find in him the

continent of
    what part a gentleman would see.
  Ham. Sir, his definement suffers no perditio
n in you; though, I

    know, to divide him inventorially would dozy th' arithmetic
of
    memo
ry, and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail.
    But, in the verity of extolment, I ta
ke him to be a soul of
great
    article, and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as, to
mak
e
    true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror, and who
else
    would trace him, his umb
rage, nothing more.
  Osr. Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
  Ham. The concernancy, si
r? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our
more
    rawer breath?
  Osr. Sir?
  Hor [aside to Hamlet
] Is't not possible to understand in
another
    tongue? You will do't, sir, really.
  Ham. What 
imports the nomination of this gentleman?
  Osr. Of Laertes?
  Hor. [aside] His purse is empty alr
eady. All's golden words are
    spent.
  Ham. Of him, sir.
  Osr. I know you are not ignorant-

  Ham. I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would
not
    much approve me. Well, si
r?
  Osr. You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is-
  Ham. I dare not confess that, lest
 I should compare with him in
    excellence; but to know a man well were to know himself.
  Osr. 
I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on
him
    by them, in his meed he's unfel
lowed.
  Ham. What's his weapon?
  Osr. Rapier and dagger.
  Ham. That's two of his weapons- but 
well.
  Osr. The King, sir, hath wager'd with him six Barbary horses;
    against the which he has
 impon'd, as I take it, six French
    rapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers
,
and
    so. Three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy,
    very responsive to th
e hilts, most delicate carriages, and of
    very liberal conceit.
  Ham. What call you the carria
ges?
  Hor. [aside to Hamlet] I knew you must be edified by the
margent
    ere you had done.
  
Osr. The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
  Ham. The phrase would be more germane to the matter if 
we could
    carry cannon by our sides. I would it might be hangers till
then.
    But on! Six Ba
rbary horses against six French swords, their
    assigns, and three liberal-conceited carriages: t
hat's the
French
    bet against the Danish. Why is this all impon'd, as you call
it?
  Osr. The
 King, sir, hath laid that, in a dozen passes between
    yourself and him, he shall not exceed you
 three hits; he hath
    laid on twelve for nine, and it would come to immediate trial
    if your
 lordship would vouchsafe the answer.
  Ham. How if I answer no?
  Osr. I mean, my lord, the oppos
ition of your person in trial.
  Ham. Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please his
Majesty,

    it is the breathing time of day with me. Let the foils be
    brought, the gentleman willing,
 and the King hold his
purpose,
    I will win for him if I can; if not, I will gain nothing but

my
    shame and the odd hits.
  Osr. Shall I redeliver you e'en so?
  Ham. To this effect, sir, 
after what flourish your nature will.
  Osr. I commend my duty to your lordship.
  Ham. Yours, you
rs. [Exit Osric.] He does well to commend it
    himself; there are no tongues else for's turn.
  
Hor. This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.
  Ham. He did comply with his dug before he
 suck'd it. Thus has
he,
    and many more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age
dotes
   
 on, only got the tune of the time and outward habit of
encounter-
    a kind of yesty collection,
 which carries them through and
    through the most fann'd and winnowed opinions; and do but
blow

    them to their trial-the bubbles are out,

                            Enter a Lord.

  Lor
d. My lord, his Majesty commended him to you by young Osric,
who
    brings back to him, that you 
attend him in the hall. He sends
to
    know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that y
ou
will
    take longer time.
  Ham. I am constant to my purposes; they follow the King's
pleasu
re.
    If his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or whensoever,
provided
    I be so able as now
.
  Lord. The King and Queen and all are coming down.
  Ham. In happy time.
  Lord. The Queen des
ires you to use some gentle entertainment to
    Laertes before you fall to play.
  Ham. She well 
instructs me.
                                                    [Exit Lord.]
  Hor. You will los
e this wager, my lord.
  Ham. I do not think so. Since he went into France I have been
in
    con
tinual practice. I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst
not
    think how ill all's here about 
my heart. But it is no matter.
  Hor. Nay, good my lord -
  Ham. It is but foolery; but it is such
 a kind of gaingiving as
    would perhaps trouble a woman.
  Hor. If your mind dislike anything, 
obey it. I will forestall
their
    repair hither and say you are not fit.
  Ham. Not a whit, we 
defy augury; there's a special providence
in
    the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not to 
come; if it
be
    not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will
come:
    the read
iness is all. Since no man knows aught of what he
leaves,
    what is't to leave betimes? Let be.


    Enter King, Queen, Laertes, Osric, and Lords, with other
              Attendants with foils
 and gauntlets.
               A table and flagons of wine on it.

  King. Come, Hamlet, come, an
d take this hand from me.
                    [The King puts Laertes' hand into Hamlet's.]
  Ham. 
Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong;
    But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.
    Thi
s presence knows,
    And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd
    With sore distraction. 
What I have done
    That might your nature, honour, and exception
    Roughly awake, I here procl
aim was madness.
    Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet.
    If Hamlet from himself be tak
en away,
    And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
    Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet den
ies it.
    Who does it, then? His madness. If't be so,
    Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong
'd;
    His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
    Sir, in this audience,
    Let my disclaiming fro
m a purpos'd evil
    Free me so far in your most generous thoughts
    That I have shot my arrow 
o'er the house
    And hurt my brother.
  Laer. I am satisfied in nature,
    Whose motive in thi
s case should stir me most
    To my revenge. But in my terms of honour
    I stand aloof, and wil
l no reconcilement
    Till by some elder masters of known honour
    I have a voice and precedent
 of peace
    To keep my name ungor'd. But till that time
    I do receive your offer'd love like 
love,
    And will not wrong it.
  Ham. I embrace it freely,
    And will this brother's wager fr
ankly play.
    Give us the foils. Come on.
  Laer. Come, one for me.
  Ham. I'll be your foil, L
aertes. In mine ignorance
    Your skill shall, like a star i' th' darkest night,
    Stick fiery 
off indeed.
  Laer. You mock me, sir.
  Ham. No, by this hand.
  King. Give them the foils, young
 Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
    You know the wager?
  Ham. Very well, my lord.
    Your Grace has laid
 the odds o' th' weaker side.
  King. I do not fear it, I have seen you both;
    But since he is 
better'd, we have therefore odds.
  Laer. This is too heavy; let me see another.
  Ham. This likes
 me well. These foils have all a length?
                                                Prepare to
 play.
  Osr. Ay, my good lord.
  King. Set me the stoups of wine upon that table.
    If Hamlet 
give the first or second hit,
    Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
    Let all the battlem
ents their ordnance fire;
    The King shall drink to Hamlet's better breath,
    And in the cup a
n union shall he throw
    Richer than that which four successive kings
    In Denmark's crown hav
e worn. Give me the cups;
    And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
    The trumpet to the cann
oneer without,
    The cannons to the heavens, the heaven to earth,
    'Now the King drinks to Ha
mlet.' Come, begin.
    And you the judges, bear a wary eye.
  Ham. Come on, sir.
  Laer. Come, m
y lord.                                They play.
  Ham. One.
  Laer. No.
  Ham. Judgment!
  Osr
. A hit, a very palpable hit.
  Laer. Well, again!
  King. Stay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl
 is thine;
    Here's to thy health.
               [Drum; trumpets sound; a piece goes off [withi
n].
    Give him the cup.
  Ham. I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile.
    Come. (They pla
y.) Another hit. What say you?
  Laer. A touch, a touch; I do confess't.
  King. Our son shall win
.
  Queen. He's fat, and scant of breath.
    Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows.
    Th
e Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
  Ham. Good madam!
  King. Gertrude, do not drink.
  Que
en. I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.          Drinks.
  King. [aside] It is the poison'd cup;
 it is too late.
  Ham. I dare not drink yet, madam; by-and-by.
  Queen. Come, let me wipe thy fac
e.
  Laer. My lord, I'll hit him now.
  King. I do not think't.
  Laer. [aside] And yet it is alm
ost against my conscience.
  Ham. Come for the third, Laertes! You but dally.
    Pray you pass wi
th your best violence;
    I am afeard you make a wanton of me.
  Laer. Say you so? Come on.      
                         Play.
  Osr. Nothing neither way.
  Laer. Have at you now!
             
   [Laertes wounds Hamlet; then] in scuffling, they
                    change rapiers, [and Hamlet
 wounds Laertes].
  King. Part them! They are incens'd.
  Ham. Nay come! again!                   
      The Queen falls.

  Osr. Look to the Queen there, ho!
  Hor. They bleed on both sides. How 
is it, my lord?
  Osr. How is't, Laertes?
  Laer. Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric.

    I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.
  Ham. How does the Queen?
  King. She sounds to s
ee them bleed.
  Queen. No, no! the drink, the drink! O my dear Hamlet!
    The drink, the drink! 
I am poison'd.                 [Dies.]
  Ham. O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd.
    Treachery
! Seek it out.
                                                [Laertes falls.]
  Laer. It is here
, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain;
    No medicine in the world can do thee good.
    In thee there
 is not half an hour of life.
    The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
    Unbated and enven
om'd. The foul practice
    Hath turn'd itself on me. Lo, here I lie,
    Never to rise again. Thy
 mother's poison'd.
    I can no more. The King, the King's to blame.
  Ham. The point envenom'd t
oo?
    Then, venom, to thy work.                    Hurts the King.
  All. Treason! treason!
  K
ing. O, yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt.
  Ham. Here, thou incestuous, murd'rous, damned Dane
,
    Drink off this potion! Is thy union here?
    Follow my mother.                             
    King dies.
  Laer. He is justly serv'd.
    It is a poison temper'd by himself.
    Exchange 
forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet.
    Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
    Nor thin
e on me!                                       Dies.
  Ham. Heaven make thee free of it! I follow t
hee.
    I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!
    You that look pale and tremble at this cha
nce,
    That are but mutes or audience to this act,
    Had I but time (as this fell sergeant, De
ath,
    Is strict in his arrest) O, I could tell you-
    But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;
   
 Thou liv'st; report me and my cause aright
    To the unsatisfied.
  Hor. Never believe it.
    
I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.
    Here's yet some liquor left.
  Ham. As th'art a man,

    Give me the cup. Let go! By heaven, I'll ha't.
    O good Horatio, what a wounded name
    (Th
ings standing thus unknown) shall live behind me!
    If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,
   
 Absent thee from felicity awhile,
    And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
    To tel
l my story.         [March afar off, and shot within.]
    What warlike noise is this?
  Osr. Youn
g Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
    To the ambassadors of England gives
    This war
like volley.
  Ham. O, I die, Horatio!
    The potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit.
    I can
not live to hear the news from England,
    But I do prophesy th' election lights
    On Fortinbra
s. He has my dying voice.
    So tell him, with th' occurrents, more and less,
    Which have soli
cited- the rest is silence.             Dies.
  Hor. Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet pr
ince,
    And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
                                           
      [March within.]
    Why does the drum come hither?

    Enter Fortinbras and English Ambass
adors, with Drum,
                  Colours, and Attendants.

  Fort. Where is this sight?
  Hor
. What is it you will see?
    If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
  Fort. This quarry c
ries on havoc. O proud Death,
    What feast is toward in thine eternal cell
    That thou so many
 princes at a shot
    So bloodily hast struck.
  Ambassador. The sight is dismal;
    And our af
fairs from England come too late.
    The ears are senseless that should give us hearing
    To te
ll him his commandment is fulfill'd
    That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.
    Where shou
ld we have our thanks?
  Hor. Not from his mouth,
    Had it th' ability of life to thank you.
  
  He never gave commandment for their death.
    But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
   
 You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
    Are here arriv'd, give order that these bodies

    High on a stage be placed to the view;
    And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
    H
ow these things came about. So shall you hear
    Of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts;
    Of acc
idental judgments, casual slaughters;
    Of deaths put on by cunning and forc'd cause;
    And, i
n this upshot, purposes mistook
    Fall'n on th' inventors' heads. All this can I
    Truly deliv
er.
  Fort. Let us haste to hear it,
    And call the noblest to the audience.
    For me, with s
orrow I embrace my fortune.
    I have some rights of memory in this kingdom
    Which now, to cla
im my vantage doth invite me.
  Hor. Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
    And from his mo
uth whose voice will draw on more.
    But let this same be presently perform'd,
    Even while me
n's minds are wild, lest more mischance
    On plots and errors happen.
  Fort. Let four captains

    Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage;
    For he was likely, had he been put on,
    To ha
ve prov'd most royally; and for his passage
    The soldiers' music and the rites of war
    Speak
 loudly for him.
    Take up the bodies. Such a sight as this
    Becomes the field but here shows
 much amiss.
    Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
            Exeunt marching; after the which a peal o
f ordnance
                                                   are shot off.

ACT I. Scene I.
Elsinore. A platform before the Castle.

Enter 
two Sentinels-[first,] Francisco, [who paces up and down
at his post; then] Bernardo, [who approach
es him].

  Ber. Who's there?
  Fran. Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.
  Ber. Long liv
e the King!
  Fran. Bernardo?
  Ber. He.
  Fran. You come most carefully upon your hour.
  Ber. 
'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.
  Fran. For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitte
r cold,
    And I am sick at heart.
  Ber. Have you had quiet guard?
  Fran. Not a mouse stirring
.
  Ber. Well, good night.
    If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
    The rivals of my watch, 
bid them make haste.

                    Enter Horatio and Marcellus.

  Fran. I think I hear t
hem. Stand, ho! Who is there?
  Hor. Friends to this ground.
  Mar. And liegemen to the Dane.
  F
ran. Give you good night.
  Mar. O, farewell, honest soldier.
    Who hath reliev'd you?
  Fran. 
Bernardo hath my place.
    Give you good night.                                   Exit.
  Mar. Ho
lla, Bernardo!
  Ber. Say-
    What, is Horatio there ?
  Hor. A piece of him.
  Ber. Welcome, H
oratio. Welcome, good Marcellus.
  Mar. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
  Ber. I hav
e seen nothing.
  Mar. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
    And will not let belief take hold of
 him
    Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.
    Therefore I have entreated him along,

    With us to watch the minutes of this night,
    That, if again this apparition come,
    He m
ay approve our eyes and speak to it.
  Hor. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
  Ber. Sit down awhile,

    And let us once again assail your ears,
    That are so fortified against our story,
    Wha
t we two nights have seen.
  Hor. Well, sit we down,
    And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.

  Ber. Last night of all,
    When yond same star that's westward from the pole
    Had made his c
ourse t' illume that part of heaven
    Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
    The bell the
n beating one-

                        Enter Ghost.

  Mar. Peace! break thee off! Look where i
t comes again!
  Ber. In the same figure, like the King that's dead.
  Mar. Thou art a scholar; sp
eak to it, Horatio.
  Ber. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.
  Hor. Most like. It harr
ows me with fear and wonder.
  Ber. It would be spoke to.
  Mar. Question it, Horatio.
  Hor. Wha
t art thou that usurp'st this time of night
    Together with that fair and warlike form
    In wh
ich the majesty of buried Denmark
    Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!
  Mar. I
t is offended.
  Ber. See, it stalks away!
  Hor. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!
      
                                               Exit Ghost.
  Mar. 'Tis gone and will not answer.
 
 Ber. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale.
    Is not this something more than fantasy?
  
  What think you on't?
  Hor. Before my God, I might not this believe
    Without the sensible and
 true avouch
    Of mine own eyes.
  Mar. Is it not like the King?
  Hor. As thou art to thyself.

    Such was the very armour he had on
    When he th' ambitious Norway combated.
    So frown'd
 he once when, in an angry parle,
    He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
    'Tis strange.

  Mar. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
    With martial stalk hath he gone by our wa
tch.
  Hor. In what particular thought to work I know not;
    But, in the gross and scope of my o
pinion,
    This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
  Mar. Good now, sit down, and tell me 
he that knows,
    Why this same strict and most observant watch
    So nightly toils the subject 
of the land,
    And why such daily cast of brazen cannon
    And foreign mart for implements of w
ar;
    Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
    Does not divide the Sunday from the w
eek.
    What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
    Doth make the night joint-labourer with 
the day?
    Who is't that can inform me?
  Hor. That can I.
    At least, the whisper goes so. O
ur last king,
    Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
    Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of 
Norway,
    Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
    Dar'd to the combat; in which our vali
ant Hamlet
    (For so this side of our known world esteem'd him)
    Did slay this Fortinbras; wh
o, by a seal'd compact,
    Well ratified by law and heraldry,
    Did forfeit, with his life, all
 those his lands
    Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror;
    Against the which a moiety co
mpetent
    Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
    To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
    H
ad he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant
    And carriage of the article design'd,
    His 
fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
    Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
    Hath in the
 skirts of Norway, here and there,
    Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
    For food and di
et, to some enterprise
    That hath a stomach in't; which is no other,
    As it doth well appear
 unto our state,
    But to recover of us, by strong hand
    And terms compulsatory, those foresa
id lands
    So by his father lost; and this, I take it,
    Is the main motive of our preparation
s,
    The source of this our watch, and the chief head
    Of this post-haste and romage in the l
and.
  Ber. I think it be no other but e'en so.
    Well may it sort that this portentous figure

    Comes armed through our watch, so like the King
    That was and is the question of these wars.

  Hor. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
    In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
   
 A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
    The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead
   
 Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;
    As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood,

    Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
    Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
    
Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.
    And even the like precurse of fierce events,
    As 
harbingers preceding still the fates
    And prologue to the omen coming on,
    Have heaven and e
arth together demonstrated
    Unto our climature and countrymen.

                      Enter Gh
ost again.

    But soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again!
    I'll cross it, though it blast me
.- Stay illusion!
                                               Spreads his arms.
    If thou has
t any sound, or use of voice,
    Speak to me.
    If there be any good thing to be done,
    Tha
t may to thee do ease, and, race to me,
    Speak to me.
    If thou art privy to thy country's fa
te,
    Which happily foreknowing may avoid,
    O, speak!
    Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy l
ife
    Extorted treasure in the womb of earth
    (For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in d
eath),
                                                 The cock crows.
    Speak of it! Stay, and
 speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!
  Mar. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
  Hor. Do, if it will n
ot stand.
  Ber. 'Tis here!
  Hor. 'Tis here!
  Mar. 'Tis gone!
                                
                     Exit Ghost.
    We do it wrong, being so majestical,
    To offer it the show
 of violence;
    For it is as the air, invulnerable,
    And our vain blows malicious mockery.
 
 Ber. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
  Hor. And then it started, like a guilty thing
 
   Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
    The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
    Doth wi
th his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
    Awake the god of day; and at his warning,
    Whether 
in sea or fire, in earth or air,
    Th' extravagant and erring spirit hies
    To his confine; an
d of the truth herein
    This present object made probation.
  Mar. It faded on the crowing of th
e cock.
    Some say that ever, 'gainst that season comes
    Wherein our Saviour's birth is celeb
rated,
    The bird of dawning singeth all night long;
    And then, they say, no spirit dare stir
 abroad,
    The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,
    No fairy takes, nor witch hath 
power to charm,
    So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
  Hor. So have I heard and do in part
 believe it.
    But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
    Walks o'er the dew of yon high eas
tward hill.
    Break we our watch up; and by my advice
    Let us impart what we have seen to-nig
ht
    Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
    This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
    
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
    As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
    L
et's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
    Where we shall find him most conveniently.          
 Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A room of state in the Castle.

Flourish. [Enter Claudius, 
King of Denmark, Gertrude the Queen,
Hamlet,
Polonius, Laertes and his sister Ophelia, [Voltemand,
 Cornelius,]
Lords Attendant.

  King. Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
    The mem
ory be green, and that it us befitted
    To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom
    T
o be contracted in one brow of woe,
    Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
    That we 
with wisest sorrow think on him
    Together with remembrance of ourselves.
    Therefore our some
time sister, now our queen,
    Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,
    Have we, as 'twe
re with a defeated joy,
    With an auspicious, and a dropping eye,
    With mirth in funeral, and
 with dirge in marriage,
    In equal scale weighing delight and dole,
    Taken to wife; nor have
 we herein barr'd
    Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
    With this affair along. For 
all, our thanks.
    Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
    Holding a weak supposal of 
our worth,
    Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
    Our state to be disjoint and out o
f frame,
    Colleagued with this dream of his advantage,
    He hath not fail'd to pester us with
 message
    Importing the surrender of those lands
    Lost by his father, with all bands of law,

    To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
    Now for ourself and for this time of meetin
g.
    Thus much the business is: we have here writ
    To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,
   
 Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears
    Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress
    His fu
rther gait herein, in that the levies,
    The lists, and full proportions are all made
    Out of
 his subject; and we here dispatch
    You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,
    For bearers of
 this greeting to old Norway,
    Giving to you no further personal power
    To business with the
 King, more than the scope
    Of these dilated articles allow.            [Gives a paper.]
    Fa
rewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
  Cor., Volt. In that, and all things, will we show o
ur duty.
  King. We doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell.
                                 Exeunt V
oltemand and Cornelius.
    And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
    You told us of some su
it. What is't, Laertes?
    You cannot speak of reason to the Dane
    And lose your voice. What w
ouldst thou beg, Laertes,
    That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
    The head is not more
 native to the heart,
    The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
    Than is the throne of Denma
rk to thy father.
    What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
  Laer. My dread lord,
    Your leave and 
favour to return to France;
    From whence though willingly I came to Denmark
    To show my duty
 in your coronation,
    Yet now I must confess, that duty done,
    My thoughts and wishes bend a
gain toward France
    And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
  King. Have you your fathe
r's leave? What says Polonius?
  Pol. He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
    By labours
ome petition, and at last
    Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent.
    I do beseech you give hi
m leave to go.
  King. Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,
    And thy best graces spend i
t at thy will!
    But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son-
  Ham. [aside] A little more than kin, a
nd less than kind!
  King. How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
  Ham. Not so, my lord. I 
am too much i' th' sun.
  Queen. Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
    And let thine eye l
ook like a friend on Denmark.
    Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
    Seek for thy noble fath
er in the dust.
    Thou know'st 'tis common. All that lives must die,
    Passing through nature 
to eternity.
  Ham. Ay, madam, it is common.
  Queen. If it be,
    Why seems it so particular wi
th thee?
  Ham. Seems, madam, Nay, it is. I know not 'seems.'
    'Tis not alone my inky cloak, go
od mother,
    Nor customary suits of solemn black,
    Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,
 
   No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
    Nor the dejected havior of the visage,
    Together 
with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
    'That can denote me truly. These indeed seem,
    For 
they are actions that a man might play;
    But I have that within which passeth show-
    These b
ut the trappings and the suits of woe.
  King. 'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,

    To give these mourning duties to your father;
    But you must know, your father lost a father;

    That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
    In filial obligation for some term
  
  To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever
    In obstinate condolement is a course
    Of impious
 stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief;
    It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
    A heart unfor
tified, a mind impatient,
    An understanding simple and unschool'd;
    For what we know must be
, and is as common
    As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
    Why should we in our peevish opp
osition
    Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
    A fault against the dead, a fault t
o nature,
    To reason most absurd, whose common theme
    Is death of fathers, and who still hat
h cried,
    From the first corse till he that died to-day,
    'This must be so.' We pray you thr
ow to earth
    This unprevailing woe, and think of us
    As of a father; for let the world take 
note
    You are the most immediate to our throne,
    And with no less nobility of love
    Than
 that which dearest father bears his son
    Do I impart toward you. For your intent
    In going 
back to school in Wittenberg,
    It is most retrograde to our desire;
    And we beseech you, ben
d you to remain
    Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
    Our chiefest courtier, cousin, a
nd our son.
  Queen. Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.
    I pray thee stay with us, go
 not to Wittenberg.
  Ham. I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
  King. Why, 'tis a loving and 
a fair reply.
    Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come.
    This gentle and unforc'd accord of Ha
mlet
    Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,
    No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-d
ay
    But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
    And the King's rouse the heaven shall br
uit again,
    Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.
                                Flourish. Ex
eunt all but Hamlet.
  Ham. O that this too too solid flesh would melt,
    Thaw, and resolve itse
lf into a dew!
    Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
    His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O G
od! God!
    How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
    Seem to me all the uses of this world!

    Fie on't! ah, fie! 'Tis an unweeded garden
    That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nat
ure
    Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
    But two months dead! Nay, not so much,
 not two.
    So excellent a king, that was to this
    Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mothe
r
    That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
    Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and eart
h!
    Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him
    As if increase of appetite had grown
    B
y what it fed on; and yet, within a month-
    Let me not think on't! Frailty, thy name is woman!-

    A little month, or ere those shoes were old
    With which she followed my poor father's body

    Like Niobe, all tears- why she, even she
    (O God! a beast that wants discourse of reason
 
   Would have mourn'd longer) married with my uncle;
    My father's brother, but no more like my f
ather
    Than I to Hercules. Within a month,
    Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
    
Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
    She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
    With 
such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
    It is not, nor it cannot come to good.
    But break my h
eart, for I must hold my tongue!

          Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo.

  Hor. Hail
 to your lordship!
  Ham. I am glad to see you well.
    Horatio!- or I do forget myself.
  Hor. 
The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
  Ham. Sir, my good friend- I'll change that name wi
th you.
    And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?
    Marcellus?
  Mar. My good lord!
  Ha
m. I am very glad to see you.- [To Bernardo] Good even, sir.-

    But what, in faith, make you fr
om Wittenberg?
  Hor. A truant disposition, good my lord.
  Ham. I would not hear your enemy say s
o,
    Nor shall you do my ear that violence
    To make it truster of your own report
    Agains
t yourself. I know you are no truant.
    But what is your affair in Elsinore?
    We'll teach you
 to drink deep ere you depart.
  Hor. My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
  Ham. I prith
ee do not mock me, fellow student.
    I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
  Hor. Indeed, m
y lord, it followed hard upon.
  Ham. Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats
    Did col
dly furnish forth the marriage tables.
    Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
    Or ever I 
had seen that day, Horatio!
    My father- methinks I see my father.
  Hor. O, where, my lord?
  
Ham. In my mind's eye, Horatio.
  Hor. I saw him once. He was a goodly king.
  Ham. He was a man, 
take him for all in all.
    I shall not look upon his like again.
  Hor. My lord, I think I saw h
im yesternight.
  Ham. Saw? who?
  Hor. My lord, the King your father.
  Ham. The King my father?

  Hor. Season your admiration for a while
    With an attent ear, till I may deliver
    Upon th
e witness of these gentlemen,
    This marvel to you.
  Ham. For God's love let me hear!
  Hor. T
wo nights together had these gentlemen
    (Marcellus and Bernardo) on their watch
    In the dead
 vast and middle of the night
    Been thus encount'red. A figure like your father,
    Armed at p
oint exactly, cap-a-pe,
    Appears before them and with solemn march
    Goes slow and stately by
 them. Thrice he walk'd
    By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
    Within his truncheon's
 length; whilst they distill'd
    Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
    Stand dumb and speak 
not to him. This to me
    In dreadful secrecy impart they did,
    And I with them the third nigh
t kept the watch;
    Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
    Form of the thing, each word
 made true and good,
    The apparition comes. I knew your father.
    These hands are not more li
ke.
  Ham. But where was this?
  Mar. My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
  Ham. Did you
 not speak to it?
  Hor. My lord, I did;
    But answer made it none. Yet once methought
    It l
ifted up it head and did address
    Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
    But even then t
he morning cock crew loud,
    And at the sound it shrunk in haste away
    And vanish'd from our 
sight.
  Ham. 'Tis very strange.
  Hor. As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
    And we did
 think it writ down in our duty
    To let you know of it.
  Ham. Indeed, indeed, sirs. But this t
roubles me.
    Hold you the watch to-night?
  Both [Mar. and Ber.] We do, my lord.
  Ham. Arm'd,
 say you?
  Both. Arm'd, my lord.
  Ham. From top to toe?
  Both. My lord, from head to foot.
  
Ham. Then saw you not his face?
  Hor. O, yes, my lord! He wore his beaver up.
  Ham. What, look'd
 he frowningly.
  Hor. A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
  Ham. Pale or red?
  Hor. Nay
, very pale.
  Ham. And fix'd his eyes upon you?
  Hor. Most constantly.
  Ham. I would I had bee
n there.
  Hor. It would have much amaz'd you.
  Ham. Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
  Hor
. While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
  Both. Longer, longer.
  Hor. Not when I sa
w't.
  Ham. His beard was grizzled- no?
  Hor. It was, as I have seen it in his life,
    A sable
 silver'd.
  Ham. I will watch to-night.
    Perchance 'twill walk again.
  Hor. I warr'nt it wil
l.
  Ham. If it assume my noble father's person,
    I'll speak to it, though hell itself should g
ape
    And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
    If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,

    Let it be tenable in your silence still;
    And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
    Give 
it an understanding but no tongue.
    I will requite your loves. So, fare you well.
    Upon the 
platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
    I'll visit you.
  All. Our duty to your honour.
  Ham. Yo
ur loves, as mine to you. Farewell.
                                        Exeunt [all but Hamlet]
.
    My father's spirit- in arms? All is not well.
    I doubt some foul play. Would the night we
re come!
    Till then sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,
    Though all the earth o'erwhel
m them, to men's eyes.
Exit.




Scene III.
Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius.

Ent
er Laertes and Ophelia.

  Laer. My necessaries are embark'd. Farewell.
    And, sister, as the w
inds give benefit
    And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
    But let me hear from you.
  Oph.
 Do you doubt that?
  Laer. For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,
    Hold it a fashion, and
 a toy in blood;
    A violet in the youth of primy nature,
    Forward, not permanent- sweet, not
 lasting;
    The perfume and suppliance of a minute;
    No more.
  Oph. No more but so?
  Laer
. Think it no more.
    For nature crescent does not grow alone
    In thews and bulk; but as this
 temple waxes,
    The inward service of the mind and soul
    Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves
 you now,
    And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
    The virtue of his will; but you must fe
ar,
    His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
    For he himself is subject to his birth
.
    He may not, as unvalued persons do,
    Carve for himself, for on his choice depends
    Th
e safety and health of this whole state,
    And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd
    Un
to the voice and yielding of that body
    Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
 
   It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
    As he in his particular act and place
    May give
 his saying deed; which is no further
    Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
    Then wei
gh what loss your honour may sustain
    If with too credent ear you list his songs,
    Or lose y
our heart, or your chaste treasure open
    To his unmast'red importunity.
    Fear it, Ophelia, f
ear it, my dear sister,
    And keep you in the rear of your affection,
    Out of the shot and da
nger of desire.
    The chariest maid is prodigal enough
    If she unmask her beauty to the moon.

    Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes.
    The canker galls the infants of the spring

    Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd,
    And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
    Con
tagious blastments are most imminent.
    Be wary then; best safety lies in fear.
    Youth to its
elf rebels, though none else near.
  Oph. I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep
    As watch
man to my heart. But, good my brother,
    Do not as some ungracious pastors do,
    Show me the s
teep and thorny way to heaven,
    Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
    Himself the p
rimrose path of dalliance treads
    And recks not his own rede.
  Laer. O, fear me not!

      
                 Enter Polonius.

    I stay too long. But here my father comes.
    A double ble
ssing is a double grace;
    Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
  Pol. Yet here, Laertes? Aboard
, aboard, for shame!
    The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
    And you are stay'd for. T
here- my blessing with thee!
    And these few precepts in thy memory
    Look thou character. Giv
e thy thoughts no tongue,
    Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.
    Be thou familiar, but by
 no means vulgar:
    Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
    Grapple them unto thy
 soul with hoops of steel;
    But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
    Of each new-hatch'd
, unfledg'd comrade. Beware
    Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,
    Bear't that th' oppose
d may beware of thee.
    Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice;
    Take each man's censure
, but reserve thy judgment.
    Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
    But not express'd in fa
ncy; rich, not gaudy;
    For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
    And they in France of the bes
t rank and station
    Are most select and generous, chief in that.
    Neither a borrower nor a l
ender be;
    For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
    And borrowing dulls the edge of husba
ndry.
    This above all- to thine own self be true,
    And it must follow, as the night the day,

    Thou canst not then be false to any man.
    Farewell. My blessing season this in thee!
  La
er. Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
  Pol. The time invites you. Go, your servants tend.

  Laer. Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well
    What I have said to you.
  Oph. 'Tis in my memory
 lock'd,
    And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
  Laer. Farewell.                         
                 Exit.
  Pol. What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?
  Oph. So please you, somet
hing touching the Lord Hamlet.
  Pol. Marry, well bethought!
    'Tis told me he hath very oft of 
late
    Given private time to you, and you yourself
    Have of your audience been most free and 
bounteous.
    If it be so- as so 'tis put on me,
    And that in way of caution- I must tell you

    You do not understand yourself so clearly
    As it behooves my daughter and your honour.
   
 What is between you? Give me up the truth.
  Oph. He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
   
 Of his affection to me.
  Pol. Affection? Pooh! You speak like a green girl,
    Unsifted in such
 perilous circumstance.
    Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
  Oph. I do not know, my
 lord, what I should think,
  Pol. Marry, I will teach you! Think yourself a baby
    That you hav
e ta'en these tenders for true pay,
    Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,
    O
r (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
    Running it thus) you'll tender me a fool.
  Oph. 
My lord, he hath importun'd me with love
    In honourable fashion.
  Pol. Ay, fashion you may cal
l it. Go to, go to!
  Oph. And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
    With almost all 
the holy vows of heaven.
  Pol. Ay, springes to catch woodcocks! I do know,
    When the blood bur
ns, how prodigal the soul
    Lends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter,
    Giving more light
 than heat, extinct in both
    Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
    You must not take fo
r fire. From this time
    Be something scanter of your maiden presence.
    Set your entreatments
 at a higher rate
    Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
    Believe so much in him, that 
he is young,
    And with a larger tether may he walk
    Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia,

    Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
    Not of that dye which their investments sho
w,
    But mere implorators of unholy suits,
    Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
    T
he better to beguile. This is for all:
    I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth
    H
ave you so slander any moment leisure
    As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
    Look 
to't, I charge you. Come your ways.
  Oph. I shall obey, my lord.
                                
                         Exeunt.




Scene IV.
Elsinore. The platform before the Castle.

En
ter Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus.

  Ham. The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
  Hor. It is
 a nipping and an eager air.
  Ham. What hour now?
  Hor. I think it lacks of twelve.
  Mar. No, 
it is struck.
  Hor. Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws near the season
    Wherein the spirit 
held his wont to walk.
                   A flourish of trumpets, and two pieces go off.
    What 
does this mean, my lord?
  Ham. The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
    Keeps wassail
, and the swagg'ring upspring reels,
    And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
    The k
ettledrum and trumpet thus bray out
    The triumph of his pledge.
  Hor. Is it a custom?
  Ham. 
Ay, marry, is't;
    But to my mind, though I am native here
    And to the manner born, it is a c
ustom
    More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
    This heavy-headed revel east and we
st
    Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations;
    They clip us drunkards and with swinish p
hrase
    Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
    From our achievements, though perform'd at he
ight,
    The pith and marrow of our attribute.
    So oft it chances in particular men
    That,
 for some vicious mole of nature in them,
    As in their birth,- wherein they are not guilty,
   
 Since nature cannot choose his origin,-
    By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
    Oft breakin
g down the pales and forts of reason,
    Or by some habit that too much o'erleavens
    The form 
of plausive manners, that these men
    Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
    Being nature
's livery, or fortune's star,
    Their virtues else- be they as pure as grace,
    As infinite as
 man may undergo-
    Shall in the general censure take corruption
    From that particular fault.
 The dram of e'il
    Doth all the noble substance often dout To his own scandal.

              
           Enter Ghost.

  Hor. Look, my lord, it comes!
  Ham. Angels and ministers of grace def
end us!
    Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
    Bring with thee airs from heaven or b
lasts from hell,
    Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
    Thou com'st in such a questionable s
hape
    That I will speak to thee. I'll call thee Hamlet,
    King, father, royal Dane. O, answer
 me?
    Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell
    Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,
 
   Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre
    Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
    Hath
 op'd his ponderous and marble jaws
    To cast thee up again. What may this mean
    That thou, d
ead corse, again in complete steel,
    Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
    Making night h
ideous, and we fools of nature
    So horridly to shake our disposition
    With thoughts beyond t
he reaches of our souls?
    Say, why is this? wherefore? What should we do?
                     
                      Ghost beckons Hamlet.
  Hor. It beckons you to go away with it,
    As if it
 some impartment did desire
    To you alone.
  Mar. Look with what courteous action
    It waves
 you to a more removed ground.
    But do not go with it!
  Hor. No, by no means!
  Ham. It will 
not speak. Then will I follow it.
  Hor. Do not, my lord!
  Ham. Why, what should be the fear?
  
  I do not set my life at a pin's fee;
    And for my soul, what can it do to that,
    Being a th
ing immortal as itself?
    It waves me forth again. I'll follow it.
  Hor. What if it tempt you t
oward the flood, my lord,
    Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
    That beetles o'er his bas
e into the sea,
    And there assume some other, horrible form
    Which might deprive your sovere
ignty of reason
    And draw you into madness? Think of it.
    The very place puts toys of desper
ation,
    Without more motive, into every brain
    That looks so many fadoms to the sea
    And
 hears it roar beneath.
  Ham. It waves me still.
    Go on. I'll follow thee.
  Mar. You shall n
ot go, my lord.
  Ham. Hold off your hands!
  Hor. Be rul'd. You shall not go.
  Ham. My fate cri
es out
    And makes each petty artire in this body
    As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
    
                                            [Ghost beckons.]

    Still am I call'd. Unhand me, ge
ntlemen.
    By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!-
    I say, away!- Go on. I'll foll
ow thee.
                                        Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet.
  Hor. He waxes desperat
e with imagination.
  Mar. Let's follow. 'Tis not fit thus to obey him.
  Hor. Have after. To what
 issue will this come?
  Mar. Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
  Hor. Heaven will dire
ct it.
  Mar. Nay, let's follow him.
                                                         Exeu
nt.




Scene V.
Elsinore. The Castle. Another part of the fortifications.

Enter Ghost and 
Hamlet.

  Ham. Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak! I'll go no further.
  Ghost. Mark me.
  Ham. I
 will.
  Ghost. My hour is almost come,
    When I to sulph'rous and tormenting flames
    Must r
ender up myself.
  Ham. Alas, poor ghost!
  Ghost. Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
    
To what I shall unfold.
  Ham. Speak. I am bound to hear.
  Ghost. So art thou to revenge, when th
ou shalt hear.
  Ham. What?
  Ghost. I am thy father's spirit,
    Doom'd for a certain term to w
alk the night,
    And for the day confin'd to fast in fires,
    Till the foul crimes done in my 
days of nature
    Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid
    To tell the secrets of my p
rison house,
    I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
    Would harrow up thy soul, freeze th
y young blood,
    Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
    Thy knotted and co
mbined locks to part,
    And each particular hair to stand on end
    Like quills upon the fretfu
l porcupine.
    But this eternal blazon must not be
    To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O
, list!
    If thou didst ever thy dear father love-
  Ham. O God!
  Ghost. Revenge his foul and 
most unnatural murther.
  Ham. Murther?
  Ghost. Murther most foul, as in the best it is;
    But
 this most foul, strange, and unnatural.
  Ham. Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
  
  As meditation or the thoughts of love,
    May sweep to my revenge.
  Ghost. I find thee apt;
 
   And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
    That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
    
Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.
    'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,

    A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark
    Is by a forged process of my death
    Ra
nkly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth,
    The serpent that did sting thy father's life
    Now 
wears his crown.
  Ham. O my prophetic soul!
    My uncle?
  Ghost. Ay, that incestuous, that adu
lterate beast,
    With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts-
    O wicked wit and gifts, 
that have the power
    So to seduce!- won to his shameful lust
    The will of my most seeming-vi
rtuous queen.
    O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there,
    From me, whose love was of that dign
ity
    That it went hand in hand even with the vow
    I made to her in marriage, and to decline

    Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
    To those of mine!
    But virtue, as it never
 will be mov'd,
    Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
    So lust, though to a radian
t angel link'd,
    Will sate itself in a celestial bed
    And prey on garbage.
    But soft! me
thinks I scent the morning air.
    Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
    My custom alw
ays of the afternoon,
    Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
    With juice of cursed hebona in 
a vial,
    And in the porches of my ears did pour
    The leperous distilment; whose effect
    
Holds such an enmity with blood of man
    That swift as quicksilver it courses through
    The na
tural gates and alleys of the body,
    And with a sudden vigour it doth posset
    And curd, like
 eager droppings into milk,
    The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine;
    And a most insta
nt tetter bark'd about,
    Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust
    All my smooth body.

    Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
    Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd
;
    Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
    Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd,
    No reck
oning made, but sent to my account
    With all my imperfections on my head.
  Ham. O, horrible! O
, horrible! most horrible!
  Ghost. If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.
    Let not the roya
l bed of Denmark be
    A couch for luxury and damned incest.
    But, howsoever thou pursuest thi
s act,
    Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
    Against thy mother aught. Leave her t
o heaven,
    And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge
    To prick and sting her. Fare thee we
ll at once.
    The glowworm shows the matin to be near
    And gins to pale his uneffectual fire.

    Adieu, adieu, adieu! Remember me.                      Exit.

  Ham. O all you host of heave
n! O earth! What else?
    And shall I couple hell? Hold, hold, my heart!
    And you, my sinews, 
grow not instant old,
    But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?
    Ay, thou poor ghost, while me
mory holds a seat
    In this distracted globe. Remember thee?
    Yea, from the table of my memor
y
    I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
    All saws of books, all forms, all pressures pas
t
    That youth and observation copied there,
    And thy commandment all alone shall live
    W
ithin the book and volume of my brain,
    Unmix'd with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!
    O most p
ernicious woman!
    O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
    My tables! Meet it is I set 
it down
    That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
    At least I am sure it may be so i
n Denmark.        [Writes.]
    So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word:
    It is 'Adieu, adieu!
 Remember me.'
    I have sworn't.
  Hor. (within) My lord, my lord!

                   Enter H
oratio and Marcellus.

  Mar. Lord Hamlet!
  Hor. Heaven secure him!
  Ham. So be it!
  Mar. Il
lo, ho, ho, my lord!
  Ham. Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.
  Mar. How is't, my noble lord?

  Hor. What news, my lord?
  Mar. O, wonderful!
  Hor. Good my lord, tell it.
  Ham. No, you wil
l reveal it.
  Hor. Not I, my lord, by heaven!
  Mar. Nor I, my lord.
  Ham. How say you then? Wo
uld heart of man once think it?
    But you'll be secret?
  Both. Ay, by heaven, my lord.
  Ham. 
There's neer a villain dwelling in all Denmark
    But he's an arrant knave.
  Hor. There needs no
 ghost, my lord, come from the grave
    To tell us this.
  Ham. Why, right! You are in the right!

    And so, without more circumstance at all,
    I hold it fit that we shake hands and part;
  
  You, as your business and desires shall point you,
    For every man hath business and desire,
 
   Such as it is; and for my own poor part,
    Look you, I'll go pray.
  Hor. These are but wild 
and whirling words, my lord.
  Ham. I am sorry they offend you, heartily;
    Yes, faith, heartily
.
  Hor. There's no offence, my lord.
  Ham. Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
    An
d much offence too. Touching this vision here,
    It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.
  
  For your desire to know what is between us,
    O'ermaster't as you may. And now, good friends,

    As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,
    Give me one poor request.
  Hor. What is't, my
 lord? We will.
  Ham. Never make known what you have seen to-night.
  Both. My lord, we will not.

  Ham. Nay, but swear't.
  Hor. In faith,
    My lord, not I.
  Mar. Nor I, my lord- in faith.

  Ham. Upon my sword.
  Mar. We have sworn, my lord, already.
  Ham. Indeed, upon my sword, indee
d.

                 Ghost cries under the stage.

  Ghost. Swear.
  Ham. Aha boy, say'st thou 
so? Art thou there, truepenny?
    Come on! You hear this fellow in the cellarage.
    Consent to 
swear.
  Hor. Propose the oath, my lord.
  Ham. Never to speak of this that you have seen.
    Sw
ear by my sword.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
  Ham. Hic et ubique? Then we'll shift our ground.
   
 Come hither, gentlemen,
    And lay your hands again upon my sword.
    Never to speak of this th
at you have heard:
    Swear by my sword.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear by his sword.
  Ham. Well said
, old mole! Canst work i' th' earth so fast?
    A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends."

  Hor. O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
  Ham. And therefore as a stranger give it w
elcome.
    There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
    Than are dreamt of in your phi
losophy.
    But come!
    Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
    How strange or odd soe'
er I bear myself
    (As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
    To put an antic disposition on
),
    That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
    With arms encumb'red thus, or this head
-shake,
    Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
    As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could,
 an if we would,'
    Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'
    Or such ambig
uous giving out, to note
    That you know aught of me- this is not to do,
    So grace and mercy 
at your most need help you,
    Swear.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
                                
                   [They swear.]
  Ham. Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! So, gentlemen,
    With all 
my love I do commend me to you;
    And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
    May do t' express his 
love and friending to you,
    God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;
    And still y
our fingers on your lips, I pray.
    The time is out of joint. O cursed spite
    That ever I was
 born to set it right!
    Nay, come, let's go together.
                                         
                Exeunt.

Act II. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the house of Polo
nius.

Enter Polonius and Reynaldo.

  Pol. Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
  Re
y. I will, my lord.
  Pol. You shall do marvell's wisely, good Reynaldo,
    Before You visit him,
 to make inquire
    Of his behaviour.
  Rey. My lord, I did intend it.
  Pol. Marry, well said, 
very well said. Look you, sir,
    Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
    And how, and w
ho, what means, and where they keep,
    What company, at what expense; and finding
    By this en
compassment and drift of question
    That they do know my son, come you more nearer
    Than your
 particular demands will touch it.
    Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
    As 
thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
    And in part him.' Do you mark this, Reynaldo?
  Rey.
 Ay, very well, my lord.
  Pol. 'And in part him, but,' you may say, 'not well.
    But if't be he
 I mean, he's very wild
    Addicted so and so'; and there put on him
    What forgeries you pleas
e; marry, none so rank
    As may dishonour him- take heed of that;
    But, sir, such wanton, wil
d, and usual slips
    As are companions noted and most known
    To youth and liberty.
  Rey. As
 gaming, my lord.
  Pol. Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
    Drabbing. You may go
 so far.
  Rey. My lord, that would dishonour him.
  Pol. Faith, no, as you may season it in the c
harge.
    You must not put another scandal on him,
    That he is open to incontinency.
    That
's not my meaning. But breathe his faults so quaintly
    That they may seem the taints of liberty,

    The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
    A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
    Of genera
l assault.
  Rey. But, my good lord-
  Pol. Wherefore should you do this?
  Rey. Ay, my lord,
  
  I would know that.
  Pol. Marry, sir, here's my drift,
    And I believe it is a fetch of warran
t.
    You laying these slight sullies on my son
    As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' th' work
ing,
    Mark you,
    Your party in converse, him you would sound,
    Having ever seen in the p
renominate crimes
    The youth you breathe of guilty, be assur'd
    He closes with you in this c
onsequence:
    'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman'-
    According to the phrase or the
 addition
    Of man and country-
  Rey. Very good, my lord.
  Pol. And then, sir, does 'a this- 
'a does- What was I about to
say?
    By the mass, I was about to say something! Where did I leave
?
  Rey. At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,' and
    gentleman.'
  Pol. At 'closes
 in the consequence'- Ay, marry!
    He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman.
    I saw him yesterda
y, or t'other day,
    Or then, or then, with such or such; and, as you say,
    There was 'a gami
ng; there o'ertook in's rouse;
    There falling out at tennis'; or perchance,
    'I saw him ente
r such a house of sale,'
    Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
    See you now-
    Your bait of
 falsehood takes this carp of truth;
    And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
    With windlasse
s and with assays of bias,
    By indirections find directions out.
    So, by my former lecture a
nd advice,
    Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?
  Rey. My lord, I have.
  Pol. God b'
 wi' ye, fare ye well!
  Rey. Good my lord!                                    [Going.]
  Pol. Obs
erve his inclination in yourself.
  Rey. I shall, my lord.
  Pol. And let him ply his music.
  Re
y. Well, my lord.
  Pol. Farewell!
                                                  Exit Reynaldo
.

                       Enter Ophelia.

    How now, Ophelia? What's the matter?
  Oph. O my 
lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
  Pol. With what, i' th' name of God?
  Oph. My lord, as
 I was sewing in my closet,
    Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac'd,
    No hat upon his he
ad, his stockings foul'd,
    Ungart'red, and down-gyved to his ankle;
    Pale as his shirt, his 
knees knocking each other,
    And with a look so piteous in purport
    As if he had been loosed 
out of hell
    To speak of horrors- he comes before me.
  Pol. Mad for thy love?
  Oph. My lord,
 I do not know,
    But truly I do fear it.
  Pol. What said he?
  Oph. He took me by the wrist a
nd held me hard;
    Then goes he to the length of all his arm,
    And, with his other hand thus 
o'er his brow,
    He falls to such perusal of my face
    As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so.

    At last, a little shaking of mine arm,
    And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
    
He rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound
    As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
    And end hi
s being. That done, he lets me go,
    And with his head over his shoulder turn'd
    He seem'd to
 find his way without his eyes,
    For out o' doors he went without their help
    And to the las
t bended their light on me.
  Pol. Come, go with me. I will go seek the King.
    This is the very
 ecstasy of love,
    Whose violent property fordoes itself
    And leads the will to desperate un
dertakings
    As oft as any passion under heaven
    That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.

    What, have you given him any hard words of late?
  Oph. No, my good lord; but, as you did comma
nd,
    I did repel his letters and denied
    His access to me.
  Pol. That hath made him mad.

    I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
    I had not quoted him. I fear'd he did but tri
fle
    And meant to wrack thee; but beshrew my jealousy!
    By heaven, it is as proper to our ag
e
    To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
    As it is common for the younger sort
    To la
ck discretion. Come, go we to the King.
    This must be known; which, being kept close, might move

    More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
    Come.
                                      
                   Exeunt.

Scene II.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Flourish. [Enter King an
d Queen, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern,
cum aliis.

  King. Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildens
tern.
    Moreover that we much did long to see you,
    The need we have to use you did provoke

    Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
    Of Hamlet's transformation. So I call it,
    
Sith nor th' exterior nor the inward man
    Resembles that it was. What it should be,
    More th
an his father's death, that thus hath put him
    So much from th' understanding of himself,
    I
 cannot dream of. I entreat you both
    That, being of so young days brought up with him,
    And
 since so neighbour'd to his youth and haviour,
    That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court

    Some little time; so by your companies
    To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather
    So 
much as from occasion you may glean,
    Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus
    That, o
pen'd, lies within our remedy.
  Queen. Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,
    And sure I
 am two men there are not living
    To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
    To show us
 so much gentry and good will
    As to expend your time with us awhile
    For the supply and pro
fit of our hope,
    Your visitation shall receive such thanks
    As fits a king's remembrance.

  Ros. Both your Majesties
    Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
    Put your dread pl
easures more into command
    Than to entreaty.
  Guil. But we both obey,
    And here give up ou
rselves, in the full bent,
    To lay our service freely at your feet,
    To be commanded.
  Kin
g. Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
  Queen. Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrant
z.
    And I beseech you instantly to visit
    My too much changed son.- Go, some of you,
    An
d bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
  Guil. Heavens make our presence and our practices
    P
leasant and helpful to him!
  Queen. Ay, amen!
                 Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenster
n, [with some
                                                    Attendants].

                 
        Enter Polonius.

  Pol. Th' ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
    Are joyfully retur
n'd.
  King. Thou still hast been the father of good news.
  Pol. Have I, my lord? Assure you, my 
good liege,
    I hold my duty as I hold my soul,
    Both to my God and to my gracious king;
   
 And I do think- or else this brain of mine
    Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
    As it ha
th us'd to do- that I have found
    The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
  King. O, speak of that! 
That do I long to hear.
  Pol. Give first admittance to th' ambassadors.
    My news shall be the 
fruit to that great feast.
  King. Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
                  
                              [Exit Polonius.]
    He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found
  
  The head and source of all your son's distemper.
  Queen. I doubt it is no other but the main,
 
   His father's death and our o'erhasty marriage.
  King. Well, we shall sift him.

             
 Enter Polonius, Voltemand, and Cornelius.

    Welcome, my good friends.
    Say, Voltemand, wha
t from our brother Norway?
  Volt. Most fair return of greetings and desires.
    Upon our first, 
he sent out to suppress
    His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
    To be a preparation 'ga
inst the Polack,
    But better look'd into, he truly found
    It was against your Highness; wher
eat griev'd,
    That so his sickness, age, and impotence
    Was falsely borne in hand, sends out
 arrests
    On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys,
    Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fi
ne,
    Makes vow before his uncle never more
    To give th' assay of arms against your Majesty.

    Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
    Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee
    
And his commission to employ those soldiers,
    So levied as before, against the Polack;
    With
 an entreaty, herein further shown,
                                                [Gives a paper.
]
    That it might please you to give quiet pass
    Through your dominions for this enterprise,

    On such regards of safety and allowance
    As therein are set down.
  King. It likes us well
;
    And at our more consider'd time we'll read,
    Answer, and think upon this business.
    M
eantime we thank you for your well-took labour.
    Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together.

    Most welcome home!                       Exeunt Ambassadors.
  Pol. This business is well end
ed.
    My liege, and madam, to expostulate
    What majesty should be, what duty is,
    Why day
 is day, night is night, and time is time.
    Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time.
   
 Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
    And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,

    I will be brief. Your noble son is mad.
    Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,
    
What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
    But let that go.
  Queen. More matter, with less art
.
  Pol. Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
    That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;

    And pity 'tis 'tis true. A foolish figure!
    But farewell it, for I will use no art.
    Mad
 let us grant him then. And now remains
    That we find out the cause of this effect-
    Or rath
er say, the cause of this defect,
    For this effect defective comes by cause.
    Thus it remain
s, and the remainder thus.
    Perpend.
    I have a daughter (have while she is mine),
    Who i
n her duty and obedience, mark,
    Hath given me this. Now gather, and surmise.
                 
                            [Reads] the letter.
    'To the celestial, and my soul's idol, the most
 beautified
      Ophelia,'-

    That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is a vile
  
    phrase.
    But you shall hear. Thus:
                                                        
[Reads.]
    'In her excellent white bosom, these, &c.'
  Queen. Came this from Hamlet to her?
  
Pol. Good madam, stay awhile. I will be faithful.     [Reads.]


          'Doubt thou the stars 
are fire;
            Doubt that the sun doth move;
          Doubt truth to be a liar;
         
   But never doubt I love.
      'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers; I have not art
to
  
  reckon my groans; but that I love thee best, O most best,
believe
    it. Adieu.
      'Thine e
vermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to
him,

HAMLET.'

    This, in obedience, hath
 my daughter shown me;
    And more above, hath his solicitings,
    As they fell out by time, by 
means, and place,
    All given to mine ear.
  King. But how hath she
    Receiv'd his love?
  P
ol. What do you think of me?
  King. As of a man faithful and honourable.
  Pol. I would fain prov
e so. But what might you think,
    When I had seen this hot love on the wing
    (As I perceiv'd 
it, I must tell you that,
    Before my daughter told me), what might you,
    Or my dear Majesty 
your queen here, think,
    If I had play'd the desk or table book,
    Or given my heart a winkin
g, mute and dumb,
    Or look'd upon this love with idle sight?
    What might you think? No, I we
nt round to work
    And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
    'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out o
f thy star.
    This must not be.' And then I prescripts gave her,
    That she should lock hersel
f from his resort,
    Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
    Which done, she took the fruits
 of my advice,
    And he, repulsed, a short tale to make,
    Fell into a sadness, then into a fa
st,
    Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
    Thence to a lightness, and, by this declens
ion,
    Into the madness wherein now he raves,
    And all we mourn for.
  King. Do you think 't
is this?
  Queen. it may be, very like.
  Pol. Hath there been such a time- I would fain know that
-
    That I have Positively said ''Tis so,'
    When it prov'd otherwise.?
  King. Not that I kn
ow.
  Pol. [points to his head and shoulder] Take this from this, if
this
      be otherwise.
  
  If circumstances lead me, I will find
    Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
    With
in the centre.
  King. How may we try it further?
  Pol. You know sometimes he walks for hours tog
ether
    Here in the lobby.
  Queen. So he does indeed.
  Pol. At such a time I'll loose my daug
hter to him.
    Be you and I behind an arras then.
    Mark the encounter. If he love her not,
 
   And he not from his reason fall'n thereon
    Let me be no assistant for a state,
    But keep 
a farm and carters.
  King. We will try it.

                 Enter Hamlet, reading on a book.


  Queen. But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
  Pol. Away, I do beseech you, both a
way
    I'll board him presently. O, give me leave.
                       Exeunt King and Queen, 
[with Attendants].
    How does my good Lord Hamlet?
  Ham. Well, God-a-mercy.
  Pol. Do you know
 me, my lord?
  Ham. Excellent well. You are a fishmonger.
  Pol. Not I, my lord.
  Ham. Then I w
ould you were so honest a man.
  Pol. Honest, my lord?
  Ham. Ay, sir. To be honest, as this world
 goes, is to be one
man
    pick'd out of ten thousand.
  Pol. That's very true, my lord.
  Ham.
 For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god
    kissing carrion- Have you a daughter?

  Pol. I have, my lord.
  Ham. Let her not walk i' th' sun. Conception is a blessing, but
not
  
  as your daughter may conceive. Friend, look to't.
  Pol. [aside] How say you by that? Still harpi
ng on my daughter.
Yet
    he knew me not at first. He said I was a fishmonger. He is
far
    go
ne, far gone! And truly in my youth I suff'red much
extremity
    for love- very near this. I'll s
peak to him again.- What do
you
    read, my lord?
  Ham. Words, words, words.
  Pol. What is th
e matter, my lord?
  Ham. Between who?
  Pol. I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
  Ham. S
landers, sir; for the satirical rogue says here that old
men
    have grey beards; that their face
s are wrinkled; their eyes
    purging thick amber and plum-tree gum; and that they have a
    ple
ntiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams. All
which,
    sir, though I most powerfully and
 potently believe, yet I
hold it
    not honesty to have it thus set down; for you yourself, sir,

    should be old as I am if, like a crab, you could go backward.

  Pol. [aside] Though this be 
madness, yet there is a method
in't.-
   Will You walk out of the air, my lord?
  Ham. Into my gr
ave?
  Pol. Indeed, that is out o' th' air. [Aside] How pregnant
sometimes
    his replies are! a
 happiness that often madness hits on,
which
    reason and sanity could not so prosperously be de
livered of.
I
    will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting
between
    him and 
my daughter.- My honourable lord, I will most humbly
take
    my leave of you.
  Ham. You cannot,
 sir, take from me anything that I will more
    willingly part withal- except my life, except my l
ife, except
my
    life,

                    Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Pol. Fare
 you well, my lord.
  Ham. These tedious old fools!
  Pol. You go to seek the Lord Hamlet. There h
e is.
  Ros. [to Polonius] God save you, sir!
                                                Exit
 [Polonius].

  Guil. My honour'd lord!
  Ros. My most dear lord!
  Ham. My excellent good frien
ds! How dost thou, Guildenstern?
Ah,
    Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
  Ros. As the in
different children of the earth.
  Guil. Happy in that we are not over-happy.
    On Fortune's cap
 we are not the very button.
  Ham. Nor the soles of her shoe?
  Ros. Neither, my lord.
  Ham. Th
en you live about her waist, or in the middle of her
    favours?
  Guil. Faith, her privates we.

  Ham. In the secret parts of Fortune? O! most true! she is a
    strumpet. What news ?
  Ros. No
ne, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
  Ham. Then is doomsday near! But your news is not 
true. Let me
    question more in particular. What have you, my good friends,
    deserved at the 
hands of Fortune that she sends you to prison
    hither?
  Guil. Prison, my lord?
  Ham. Denmark
's a prison.
  Ros. Then is the world one.
  Ham. A goodly one; in which there are many confines, 
wards, and
    dungeons, Denmark being one o' th' worst.
  Ros. We think not so, my lord.
  Ham. 
Why, then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either
good
    or bad but thinking makes it so. 
To me it is a prison.
  Ros. Why, then your ambition makes it one. 'Tis too narrow for
your
    m
ind.
  Ham. O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a
    king of infinite space,
 were it not that I have bad dreams.
  Guil. Which dreams indeed are ambition; for the very substan
ce
of
    the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
  Ham. A dream itself is but a shadow.

  Ros. Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality
that
    it is but a shadow's sha
dow.
  Ham. Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and
outstretch'd
    heroes the beggars
' shadows. Shall we to th' court? for, by
my
    fay, I cannot reason.
  Both. We'll wait upon yo
u.
  Ham. No such matter! I will not sort you with the rest of my
    servants; for, to speak to y
ou like an honest man, I am most
    dreadfully attended. But in the beaten way of friendship,
wha
t
    make you at Elsinore?
  Ros. To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
  Ham. Beggar that I
 am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank
you;
    and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear
 a halfpenny.
Were
    you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free
    visitation? C
ome, deal justly with me. Come, come! Nay,
speak.
  Guil. What should we say, my lord?
  Ham. Why
, anything- but to th' purpose. You were sent for; and
    there is a kind of confession in your lo
oks, which your
modesties
    have not craft enough to colour. I know the good King and
Queen
  
  have sent for you.
  Ros. To what end, my lord?
  Ham. That you must teach me. But let me conjur
e you by the
rights
    of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the
    obligation 
of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear
a
    better proposer could charge you withal, b
e even and direct
with
    me, whether you were sent for or no.
  Ros. [aside to Guildenstern] Wh
at say you?
  Ham. [aside] Nay then, I have an eye of you.- If you love me,
hold
    not off.
  
Guil. My lord, we were sent for.
  Ham. I will tell you why. So shall my anticipation prevent your

    discovery, and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no
    feather. I have of late- but wh
erefore I know not- lost all
my
    mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes
s
o
    heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the
earth,
    seems to me a sterile pr
omontory; this most excellent canopy,
the
    air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, thi
s
majestical
    roof fretted with golden fire- why, it appeareth no other
thing
    to me than 
a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What
a
    piece of work is a man! how noble in reas
on! how infinite in
    faculties! in form and moving how express and admirable! in
    action how
 like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the
    beauty of the world, the paragon of animals
! And yet to me
what
    is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me- no, nor
woman
    ne
ither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.
  Ros. My lord, there was no such stuff in my tho
ughts.
  Ham. Why did you laugh then, when I said 'Man delights not me'?
  Ros. To think, my lord,
 if you delight not in man, what lenten
    entertainment the players shall receive from you. We co
ted
them
    on the way, and hither are they coming to offer you service.
  Ham. He that plays th
e king shall be welcome- his Majesty shall
    have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use
 his foil
and
    target; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humorous man
shall
    end his pa
rt in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose
    lungs are tickle o' th' sere; and the lady 
shall say her mind
    freely, or the blank verse shall halt for't. What players are
    they?
  
Ros. Even those you were wont to take such delight in, the
    tragedians of the city.
  Ham. How 
chances it they travel? Their residence, both in
    reputation and profit, was better both ways.

  Ros. I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late
    innovation.
  Ham. Do they hold
 the same estimation they did when I was in
the
    city? Are they so follow'd?
  Ros. No indeed 
are they not.
  Ham. How comes it? Do they grow rusty?
  Ros. Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wo
nted pace; but there
is,
    sir, an eyrie of children, little eyases, that cry out on the
top
 
   of question and are most tyrannically clapp'd for't. These
are now
    the fashion, and so bera
ttle the common stages (so they call
    them) that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goosequills 
and
    dare scarce come thither.
  Ham. What, are they children? Who maintains 'em? How are they

    escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can
    sing? Will they not say afte
rwards, if they should grow
    themselves to common players (as it is most like, if their
means

    are no better), their writers do them wrong to make them
exclaim
    against their own success
ion.
  Ros. Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the
nation
    holds it no sin to
 tarre them to controversy. There was, for
a
    while, no money bid for argument unless the poet 
and the
player
    went to cuffs in the question.
  Ham. Is't possible?
  Guil. O, there has bee
n much throwing about of brains.
  Ham. Do the boys carry it away?
  Ros. Ay, that they do, my lor
d- Hercules and his load too.
  Ham. It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark,
and

    those that would make mows at him while my father lived give
    twenty, forty, fifty, a hundr
ed ducats apiece for his picture
in
    little. 'Sblood, there is something in this more than
nat
ural, if
    philosophy could find it out.

                     Flourish for the Players.

  G
uil. There are the players.
  Ham. Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come!
Th'

    appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me
comply
    with you in this garb, lest
 my extent to the players (which I
    tell you must show fairly outwards) should more appear like

    entertainment than yours. You are welcome. But my
uncle-father
    and aunt-mother are deceiv
'd.
  Guil. In what, my dear lord?
  Ham. I am but mad north-north-west. When the wind is southerl
y
I
    know a hawk from a handsaw.

                            Enter Polonius.

  Pol. Well 
be with you, gentlemen!
  Ham. Hark you, Guildenstern- and you too- at each ear a hearer!
    That
 great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling
    clouts.
  Ros. Happily he's the seco
nd time come to them; for they say an
old
    man is twice a child.
  Ham. I will prophesy he com
es to tell me of the players. Mark
it.-
   You say right, sir; a Monday morning; twas so indeed.

  Pol. My lord, I have news to tell you.
  Ham. My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was 
an
actor in
    Rome-
  Pol. The actors are come hither, my lord.
  Ham. Buzz, buzz!
  Pol. Upo
n my honour-
  Ham. Then came each actor on his ass-
  Pol. The best actors in the world, either f
or tragedy, comedy,
    history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral,
    tragical-his
torical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral;
scene
    individable, or poem unlimited. Seneca ca
nnot be too heavy,
nor
    Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these
are
   
 the only men.
  Ham. O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
  Pol. What treasur
e had he, my lord?
  Ham. Why,

         'One fair daughter, and no more,
           The which h
e loved passing well.'

  Pol. [aside] Still on my daughter.
  Ham. Am I not i' th' right, old Je
phthah?
  Pol. If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I
    love passing well.

  Ham. Nay, that follows not.
  Pol. What follows then, my lord?
  Ham. Why,

           'As by 
lot, God wot,'

 and then, you know,

           'It came to pass, as most like it was.'

    
The first row of the pious chanson will show you more; for
look
    where my abridgment comes.


                     Enter four or five Players.

    You are welcome, masters; welcome, all.- I a
m glad to see
thee
    well.- Welcome, good friends.- O, my old friend? Why, thy
face is
    val
anc'd since I saw thee last. Com'st' thou to' beard me in
    Denmark?- What, my young lady and mis
tress? By'r Lady, your
    ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last by the
    altitu
de of a chopine. Pray God your voice, like a piece of
    uncurrent gold, be not crack'd within the
 ring.- Masters, you
are
    all welcome. We'll e'en to't like French falconers, fly at
    anyth
ing we see. We'll have a speech straight. Come, give us
a
    taste of your quality. Come, a passi
onate speech.
  1. Play. What speech, my good lord?
  Ham. I heard thee speak me a speech once, bu
t it was never
acted;
    or if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember,
pleas'd
    no
t the million, 'twas caviary to the general; but it was (as
I
    receiv'd it, and others, whose j
udgments in such matters
cried in
    the top of mine) an excellent play, well digested in the
sc
enes,
    set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember one said
    there were no sallets 
in the lines to make the matter
savoury,
    nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the aut
hor of
    affectation; but call'd it an honest method, as wholesome as
    sweet, and by very muc
h more handsome than fine. One speech
in't
    I chiefly lov'd. 'Twas AEneas' tale to Dido, and th
ereabout
of it
    especially where he speaks of Priam's slaughter. If it live
in
    your memor
y, begin at this line- let me see, let me see:

         'The rugged Pyrrhus, like th' Hyrcanian b
east-'

    'Tis not so; it begins with Pyrrhus:

         'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable a
rms,
         Black as his purpose, did the night resemble
         When he lay couched in the omi
nous horse,
         Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd
         With heraldry more 
dismal. Head to foot
         Now is be total gules, horridly trick'd
         With blood of fathe
rs, mothers, daughters, sons,
         Bak'd and impasted with the parching streets,
         That
 lend a tyrannous and a damned light
         To their lord's murther. Roasted in wrath and fire,

         And thus o'ersized with coagulate gore,
         With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Py
rrhus
         Old grandsire Priam seeks.'

    So, proceed you.
  Pol. Fore God, my lord, well 
spoken, with good accent and good
     discretion.

  1. Play. 'Anon he finds him,
      Strikin
g too short at Greeks. His antique sword,
      Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
      
Repugnant to command. Unequal match'd,
      Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide;
      
But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
      Th' unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium
,
      Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
      Stoops to his base, and with a hideous c
rash
      Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear. For lo! his sword,
      Which was declining on the milky 
head
      Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' th' air to stick.
      So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus s
tood,
      And, like a neutral to his will and matter,
      Did nothing.
      But, as we often
 see, against some storm,
      A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
      The bold win
ds speechless, and the orb below
      As hush as death- anon the dreadful thunder
      Doth rend
 the region; so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
      Aroused vengeance sets him new awork;
      And never
 did the Cyclops' hammers fall
      On Mars's armour, forg'd for proof eterne,
      With less re
morse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
      Now falls on Priam.
      Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune
! All you gods,
      In general synod take away her power;
      Break all the spokes and fellies
 from her wheel,
      And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
      As low as to the fie
nds!

  Pol. This is too long.
  Ham. It shall to the barber's, with your beard.- Prithee say
on
.
    He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps. Say on;
come to
    Hecuba.

  1. Play.
 'But who, O who, had seen the mobled queen-'

  Ham. 'The mobled queen'?
  Pol. That's good! 'Mo
bled queen' is good.

  1. Play. 'Run barefoot up and down, threat'ning the flames
      With bis
son rheum; a clout upon that head
      Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
      About h
er lank and all o'erteemed loins,
      A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up-
      Who this 
had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd
      'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have pronounc'd.

      But if the gods themselves did see her then,
      When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious spor
t
      In Mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,
      The instant burst of clamour that she
 made
      (Unless things mortal move them not at all)
      Would have made milch the burning ey
es of heaven
      And passion in the gods.'

  Pol. Look, whe'r he has not turn'd his colour, an
d has tears
in's
    eyes. Prithee no more!
  Ham. 'Tis well. I'll have thee speak out the rest o
f this
soon.-
    Good my lord, will you see the players well bestow'd? Do you
    hear? Let them
 be well us'd; for they are the abstract and
brief
    chronicles of the time. After your death yo
u were better have
a
    bad epitaph than their ill report while you live.
  Pol. My lord, I will
 use them according to their desert.
  Ham. God's bodykins, man, much better! Use every man after h
is
    desert, and who should scape whipping? Use them after your
own
    honour and dignity. The
 less they deserve, the more merit is
in
    your bounty. Take them in.
  Pol. Come, sirs.
  Ham
. Follow him, friends. We'll hear a play to-morrow.
                 Exeunt Polonius and Players [e
xcept the First].
    Dost thou hear me, old friend? Can you play 'The Murther of
    Gonzago'?
 
 1. Play. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need, study a
    speec
h of some dozen or sixteen lines which I would set down
and
    insert in't, could you not?
  1. 
Play. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Very well. Follow that lord- and look you mock him not.
                
                            [Exit First Player.]
    My good friends, I'll leave you till night. Yo
u are welcome
to
    Elsinore.
  Ros. Good my lord!
  Ham. Ay, so, God b' wi' ye!
             
               [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
    Now I am alone.
    O what a rogue and pea
sant slave am I!
    Is it not monstrous that this player here,
    But in a fiction, in a dream o
f passion,
    Could force his soul so to his own conceit
    That, from her working, all his visa
ge wann'd,
    Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
    A broken voice, and his whole funct
ion suiting
    With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!
    For Hecuba!
    What's Hecuba
 to him, or he to Hecuba,
    That he should weep for her? What would he do,
    Had he the motive
 and the cue for passion
    That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
    And cleave the g
eneral ear with horrid speech;
    Make mad the guilty and appal the free,
    Confound the ignora
nt, and amaze indeed
    The very faculties of eyes and ears.
    Yet I,
    A dull and muddy-met
tled rascal, peak
    Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
    And can say nothing! No, not
 for a king,
    Upon whose property and most dear life
    A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a cowar
d?
    Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
    Plucks off my beard and blows it in my fac
e?
    Tweaks me by th' nose? gives me the lie i' th' throat
    As deep as to the lungs? Who does
 me this, ha?
    'Swounds, I should take it! for it cannot be
    But I am pigeon-liver'd and lac
k gall
    To make oppression bitter, or ere this
    I should have fatted all the region kites
 
   With this slave's offal. Bloody bawdy villain!
    Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless
 villain!
    O, vengeance!
    Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
    That I, the son of
 a dear father murther'd,
    Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
    Must (like a whore) u
npack my heart with words
    And fall a-cursing like a very drab,
    A scullion!
    Fie upon't
! foh! About, my brain! Hum, I have heard
    That guilty creatures, sitting at a play,
    Have b
y the very cunning of the scene
    Been struck so to the soul that presently
    They have procla
im'd their malefactions;
    For murther, though it have no tongue, will speak
    With most mirac
ulous organ, I'll have these Players
    Play something like the murther of my father
    Before m
ine uncle. I'll observe his looks;
    I'll tent him to the quick. If he but blench,
    I know my
 course. The spirit that I have seen
    May be a devil; and the devil hath power
    T' assume a 
pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
    Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
    As he is very poten
t with such spirits,
    Abuses me to damn me. I'll have grounds
    More relative than this. The 
play's the thing
    Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King.         Exit.

ACT III. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rose
ncrantz, Guildenstern,
and Lords.

  King. And can you by no drift of circumstance
    Get from 
him why he puts on this confusion,
    Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
    With turbulent
 and dangerous lunacy?
  Ros. He does confess he feels himself distracted,
    But from what cause
 he will by no means speak.
  Guil. Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
    But with a craft
y madness keeps aloof
    When we would bring him on to some confession
    Of his true state.
  
Queen. Did he receive you well?
  Ros. Most like a gentleman.
  Guil. But with much forcing of his
 disposition.
  Ros. Niggard of question, but of our demands
    Most free in his reply.
  Queen.
 Did you assay him
    To any pastime?
  Ros. Madam, it so fell out that certain players
    We o
'erraught on the way. Of these we told him,
    And there did seem in him a kind of joy
    To hea
r of it. They are here about the court,
    And, as I think, they have already order
    This nigh
t to play before him.
  Pol. 'Tis most true;
    And he beseech'd me to entreat your Majesties
  
  To hear and see the matter.
  King. With all my heart, and it doth much content me
    To hear h
im so inclin'd.
    Good gentlemen, give him a further edge
    And drive his purpose on to these 
delights.
  Ros. We shall, my lord.
                            Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenster
n.
  King. Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
    For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
    That
 he, as 'twere by accident, may here
    Affront Ophelia.
    Her father and myself (lawful espial
s)
    Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing unseen,
    We may of their encounter frankly judge

    And gather by him, as he is behav'd,
    If't be th' affliction of his love, or no,
    That t
hus he suffers for.
  Queen. I shall obey you;
    And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
    That
 your good beauties be the happy cause
    Of Hamlet's wildness. So shall I hope your virtues
    
Will bring him to his wonted way again,
    To both your honours.
  Oph. Madam, I wish it may.
  
                                                 [Exit Queen.]
  Pol. Ophelia, walk you here.- Grac
ious, so please you,
    We will bestow ourselves.- [To Ophelia] Read on this book,
    That show 
of such an exercise may colour
    Your loneliness.- We are oft to blame in this,
    'Tis too muc
h prov'd, that with devotion's visage
    And pious action we do sugar o'er
    The Devil himself.

  King. [aside] O, 'tis too true!
    How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
    
The harlot's cheek, beautied with plast'ring art,
    Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it

    Than is my deed to my most painted word.
    O heavy burthen!
  Pol. I hear him coming. Let's 
withdraw, my lord.
                                      Exeunt King and Polonius].

            
               Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. To be, or not to be- that is the question:
    Whether 'tis 
nobler in the mind to suffer
    The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
    Or to take arms a
gainst a sea of troubles,
    And by opposing end them. To die- to sleep-
    No more; and by a sl
eep to say we end
    The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks
    That flesh is heir to. 'T
is a consummation
    Devoutly to be wish'd. To die- to sleep.
    To sleep- perchance to dream: a
y, there's the rub!
    For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
    When we have shuffled 
off this mortal coil,
    Must give us pause. There's the respect
    That makes calamity of so lo
ng life.
    For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
    Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud
 man's contumely,
    The pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay,
    The insolence of office, an
d the spurns
    That patient merit of th' unworthy takes,
    When he himself might his quietus m
ake
    With a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear,
    To grunt and sweat under a weary lif
e,
    But that the dread of something after death-
    The undiscover'd country, from whose bourn

    No traveller returns- puzzles the will,
    And makes us rather bear those ills we have
    
Than fly to others that we know not of?
    Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
    And t
hus the native hue of resolution
    Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
    And enter
prises of great pith and moment
    With this regard their currents turn awry
    And lose the nam
e of action.- Soft you now!
    The fair Ophelia!- Nymph, in thy orisons
    Be all my sins rememb
'red.
  Oph. Good my lord,
    How does your honour for this many a day?
  Ham. I humbly thank yo
u; well, well, well.
  Oph. My lord, I have remembrances of yours
    That I have longed long to r
e-deliver.
    I pray you, now receive them.
  Ham. No, not I!
    I never gave you aught.
  Oph
. My honour'd lord, you know right well you did,
    And with them words of so sweet breath compos'
d
    As made the things more rich. Their perfume lost,
    Take these again; for to the noble min
d
    Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
    There, my lord.
  Ham. Ha, ha! Are you ho
nest?
  Oph. My lord?
  Ham. Are you fair?
  Oph. What means your lordship?
  Ham. That if you b
e honest and fair, your honesty should admit
no
    discourse to your beauty.
  Oph. Could beauty
, my lord, have better commerce than with
honesty?
  Ham. Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will 
sooner transform
    honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty
can
    translat
e beauty into his likeness. This was sometime a
paradox,
    but now the time gives it proof. I di
d love you once.
  Oph. Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
  Ham. You should not have believ
'd me; for virtue cannot so
    inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it. I loved
you
  
  not.
  Oph. I was the more deceived.
  Ham. Get thee to a nunnery! Why wouldst thou be a breeder
 of
    sinners? I am myself indifferent honest, but yet I could
accuse
    me of such things tha
t it were better my mother had not borne
me.
    I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more
 offences at
my
    beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give
    them shape,
 or time to act them in. What should such fellows
as I
    do, crawling between earth and heaven? 
We are arrant knaves
all;
    believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where's your
    fath
er?
  Oph. At home, my lord.
  Ham. Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool
   
 nowhere but in's own house. Farewell.
  Oph. O, help him, you sweet heavens!
  Ham. If thou dost 
marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy
dowry:
    be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, th
ou shalt not
escape
    calumny. Get thee to a nunnery. Go, farewell. Or if thou wilt
    needs m
arry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what
    monsters you make of them. To a nunnery,
 go; and quickly too.
    Farewell.
  Oph. O heavenly powers, restore him!
  Ham. I have heard of
 your paintings too, well enough. God hath
    given you one face, and you make yourselves another.
 You jig,
you
    amble, and you lisp; you nickname God's creatures and make
your
    wantonness
 your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't! it hath
made
    me mad. I say, we will have no more ma
rriages. Those that are
    married already- all but one- shall live; the rest shall keep
as
    
they are. To a nunnery, go.                            Exit.
  Oph. O, what a noble mind is here o'
erthrown!
    The courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword,
    Th' expectancy and ros
e of the fair state,
    The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
    Th' observ'd of all obser
vers- quite, quite down!
    And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
    That suck'd the honey 
of his music vows,
    Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
    Like sweet bells jangled,
 out of tune and harsh;
    That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
    Blasted with ecstas
y. O, woe is me
    T' have seen what I have seen, see what I see!

                   Enter King
 and Polonius.

  King. Love? his affections do not that way tend;
    Nor what he spake, though 
it lack'd form a little,
    Was not like madness. There's something in his soul
    O'er which hi
s melancholy sits on brood;
    And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
    Will be some danger;
 which for to prevent,
    I have in quick determination
    Thus set it down: he shall with speed
 to England
    For the demand of our neglected tribute.
    Haply the seas, and countries differe
nt,
    With variable objects, shall expel
    This something-settled matter in his heart,
    Wh
ereon his brains still beating puts him thus
    From fashion of himself. What think you on't?
  P
ol. It shall do well. But yet do I believe
    The origin and commencement of his grief
    Sprung
 from neglected love.- How now, Ophelia?
    You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said.
    We he
ard it all.- My lord, do as you please;
    But if you hold it fit, after the play
    Let his que
en mother all alone entreat him
    To show his grief. Let her be round with him;
    And I'll be 
plac'd so please you, in the ear
    Of all their conference. If she find him not,
    To England 
send him; or confine him where
    Your wisdom best shall think.
  King. It shall be so.
    Madn
ess in great ones must not unwatch'd go.         Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. hall in the C
astle.

Enter Hamlet and three of the Players.

  Ham. Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronou
nc'd it to you,
    trippingly on the tongue. But if you mouth it, as many of our
    players do, 
I had as live the town crier spoke my lines. Nor
do
    not saw the air too much with your hand, t
hus, but use all
    gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and (as I may say)
    whirlwind of
 your passion, you must acquire and beget a
    temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offen
ds me to
the
    soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion
to
    tatters, t
o very rags, to split the cars of the groundlings,
who
    (for the most part) are capable of noth
ing but inexplicable
dumb
    shows and noise. I would have such a fellow whipp'd for
o'erdoing

    Termagant. It out-herods Herod. Pray you avoid it.
  Player. I warrant your honour.
  Ham. Be 
not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be
your
    tutor. Suit the action to the word, 
the word to the action;
with
    this special observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of
  
  nature: for anything so overdone is from the purpose of
playing,
    whose end, both at the firs
t and now, was and is, to hold, as
    'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show Virtue her own
fea
ture,
    scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time
his
    form and pressure. N
ow this overdone, or come tardy off,
though
    it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the j
udicious
    grieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance
    o'erweigh a whole the
atre of others. O, there be players that
I
    have seen play, and heard others praise, and that h
ighly (not
to
    speak it profanely), that, neither having the accent of
    Christians, nor the
 gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have
so
    strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of 
Nature's
    journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they
imitated
    humanity so abomi
nably.
  Player. I hope we have reform'd that indifferently with us,
sir.
  Ham. O, reform it alt
ogether! And let those that play your
clowns
    speak no more than is set down for them. For ther
e be of them
    that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren
    spectators to l
augh too, though in the mean time some
necessary
    question of the play be then to be considered
. That's
villanous
    and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it.
Go
    make y
ou ready.
                                                 Exeunt Players.

            Enter Pol
onius, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.

    How now, my lord? Will the King hear this piece of work
?
  Pol. And the Queen too, and that presently.
  Ham. Bid the players make haste, [Exit Polonius.
] Will you two
    help to hasten them?
  Both. We will, my lord.                       Exeunt the
y two.
  Ham. What, ho, Horatio!

                      Enter Horatio.

  Hor. Here, sweet lord
, at your service.
  Ham. Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
    As e'er my conversation cop'd w
ithal.
  Hor. O, my dear lord!
  Ham. Nay, do not think I flatter;
    For what advancement may I
 hope from thee,
    That no revenue hast but thy good spirits
    To feed and clothe thee? Why sh
ould the poor be flatter'd?
    No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
    And crook the pre
gnant hinges of the knee
    Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
    Since my dear so
ul was mistress of her choice
    And could of men distinguish, her election
    Hath seal'd thee 
for herself. For thou hast been
    As one, in suff'ring all, that suffers nothing;
    A man that
 Fortune's buffets and rewards
    Hast ta'en with equal thanks; and blest are those
    Whose blo
od and judgment are so well commingled
    That they are not a pipe for Fortune's finger
    To so
und what stop she please. Give me that man
    That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
  
  In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
    As I do thee. Something too much of this I
   
 There is a play to-night before the King.
    One scene of it comes near the circumstance,
    Wh
ich I have told thee, of my father's death.
    I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
    Eve
n with the very comment of thy soul
    Observe my uncle. If his occulted guilt
    Do not itself 
unkennel in one speech,
    It is a damned ghost that we have seen,
    And my imaginations are as
 foul
    As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
    For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,

    And after we will both our judgments join
    In censure of his seeming.
  Hor. Well, my lord.

    If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
    And scape detecting, I will pay the th

    Sound a flourish. [Enter Trumpets and Kettledrums. Danish
    march. [Enter King, Queen
, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz,
      Guildenstern, and other Lords attendant, with the Guard
  
                     carrying torches.

  Ham. They are coming to the play. I must be idle.
    G
et you a place.
  King. How fares our cousin Hamlet?
  Ham. Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon'
s dish. I eat the
air,
    promise-cramm'd. You cannot feed capons so.
  King. I have nothing wit
h this answer, Hamlet. These words are
not
    mine.
  Ham. No, nor mine now. [To Polonius] My lo
rd, you play'd once
    i' th' university, you say?
  Pol. That did I, my lord, and was accounted 
a good actor.
  Ham. What did you enact?
  Pol. I did enact Julius Caesar; I was kill'd i' th' Cap
itol;
Brutus
    kill'd me.
  Ham. It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf
there. B
e
    the players ready.
  Ros. Ay, my lord. They stay upon your patience.
  Queen. Come hither, 
my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
  Ham. No, good mother. Here's metal more attractive.
  Pol. [to the Ki
ng] O, ho! do you mark that?
  Ham. Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
                               
   [Sits down at Ophelia's feet.]

  Oph. No, my lord.
  Ham. I mean, my head upon your lap?
  O
ph. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Do you think I meant country matters?
  Oph. I think nothing, my lord.
  
Ham. That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
  Oph. What is, my lord?
  Ham. Nothing.
 
 Oph. You are merry, my lord.
  Ham. Who, I?
  Oph. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. O God, your only jig-make
r! What should a man do but be
merry?
    For look you how cheerfully my mother looks, and my fath
er
died
    within 's two hours.
  Oph. Nay 'tis twice two months, my lord.
  Ham. So long? Nay 
then, let the devil wear black, for I'll have
a
    suit of sables. O heavens! die two months ago,
 and not
forgotten
    yet? Then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his
life
    half
 a year. But, by'r Lady, he must build churches then; or
else
    shall he suffer not thinking on,
 with the hobby-horse, whose

    epitaph is 'For O, for O, the hobby-horse is forgot!'

       
        Hautboys play. The dumb show enters.

    Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Quee
n embracing
    him and he her. She kneels, and makes show of protestation
    unto him. He takes 
her up, and declines his head upon her
    neck. He lays him down upon a bank of flowers. She, seei
ng
    him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his
    crown, kisses it, pours p
oison in the sleeper's ears, and
    leaves him. The Queen returns, finds the King dead, and makes

    passionate action. The Poisoner with some three or four
Mutes,
    comes in again, seem to co
ndole with her. The dead body is
    carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with gifts; she
  
  seems harsh and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts
    his love.
                         
                                Exeunt.

  Oph. What means this, my lord?
  Ham. Marry, this is m
iching malhecho; it means mischief.
  Oph. Belike this show imports the argument of the play.

  
                    Enter Prologue.

  Ham. We shall know by this fellow. The players cannot keep

counsel;
    they'll tell all.
  Oph. Will he tell us what this show meant?
  Ham. Ay, or any sh
ow that you'll show him. Be not you asham'd
to
    show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means
.
  Oph. You are naught, you are naught! I'll mark the play.

    Pro. For us, and for our traged
y,
      Here stooping to your clemency,
      We beg your hearing patiently.                     
[Exit.]

  Ham. Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
  Oph. 'Tis brief, my lord.
  Ham. As
 woman's love.

              Enter [two Players as] King and Queen.

    King. Full thirty time
s hath Phoebus' cart gone round
      Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
      And thir
ty dozen moons with borrowed sheen
      About the world have times twelve thirties been,
      Si
nce love our hearts, and Hymen did our hands,
      Unite comutual in most sacred bands.
    Queen
. So many journeys may the sun and moon
      Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
      But
 woe is me! you are so sick of late,
      So far from cheer and from your former state.
      Tha
t I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
      Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must;
      Fo
r women's fear and love holds quantity,
      In neither aught, or in extremity.
      Now what my
 love is, proof hath made you know;
      And as my love is siz'd, my fear is so.
      Where love
 is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
      Where little fears grow great, great love grows ther
e.
    King. Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;
      My operant powers their functi
ons leave to do.
      And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
      Honour'd, belov'd, and
 haply one as kind
      For husband shalt thou-
    Queen. O, confound the rest!
      Such love
 must needs be treason in my breast.
      When second husband let me be accurst!
      None wed t
he second but who killed the first.

  Ham. [aside] Wormwood, wormwood!

    Queen. The instance
s that second marriage move
      Are base respects of thrift, but none of love.
      A second ti
me I kill my husband dead
      When second husband kisses me in bed.
    King. I do believe you t
hink what now you speak;
      But what we do determine oft we break.
      Purpose is but the sla
ve to memory,
      Of violent birth, but poor validity;
      Which now, like fruit unripe, stick
s on the tree,
      But fall unshaken when they mellow be.
      Most necessary 'tis that we forg
et
      To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt.
      What to ourselves in passion we propose
,
      The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
      The violence of either grief or joy
    
  Their own enactures with themselves destroy.
      Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;

      Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
      This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not
 strange
      That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
      For 'tis a question left
 us yet to prove,
      Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
      The great man down,
 you mark his favourite flies,
      The poor advanc'd makes friends of enemies;
      And hithert
o doth love on fortune tend,
      For who not needs shall never lack a friend,
      And who in w
ant a hollow friend doth try,
      Directly seasons him his enemy.
      But, orderly to end wher
e I begun,
      Our wills and fates do so contrary run
      That our devices still are overthrow
n;
      Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own.
      So think thou wilt no second hus
band wed;
      But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
    Queen. Nor earth to me give 
food, nor heaven light,
      Sport and repose lock from me day and night,
      To desperation tu
rn my trust and hope,
      An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope,
      Each opposite that blan
ks the face of joy
      Meet what I would have well, and it destroy,
      Both here and hence pu
rsue me lasting strife,
      If, once a widow, ever I be wife!

  Ham. If she should break it no
w!

    King. 'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile.
      My spirits grow dull, and fai
n I would beguile
      The tedious day with sleep.
    Queen. Sleep rock thy brain,
            
                                        [He] sleeps.
      And never come mischance between us twai
n!
Exit.

  Ham. Madam, how like you this play?
  Queen. The lady doth protest too much, methink
s.
  Ham. O, but she'll keep her word.
  King. Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in
't?
  Ham. No, no! They do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i'
th'
    world.
  King. What d
o you call the play?
  Ham. 'The Mousetrap.' Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the
    image of
 a murther done in Vienna. Gonzago is the duke's
name;
    his wife, Baptista. You shall see anon.
 'Tis a knavish piece
of
    work; but what o' that? Your Majesty, and we that have free
    soul
s, it touches us not. Let the gall'd jade winch; our
withers
    are unwrung.

                 
        Enter Lucianus.

    This is one Lucianus, nephew to the King.
  Oph. You are as good as 
a chorus, my lord.
  Ham. I could interpret between you and your love, if I could
see
    the pup
pets dallying.
  Oph. You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
  Ham. It would cost you a groaning to 
take off my edge.
  Oph. Still better, and worse.
  Ham. So you must take your husbands.- Begin, m
urtherer. Pox,
leave
    thy damnable faces, and begin! Come, the croaking raven doth
    bellow 
for revenge.

    Luc. Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
      Confederate
 season, else no creature seeing;
      Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,
      With
 Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,
      Thy natural magic and dire property
      On 
wholesome life usurp immediately.
                                   Pours the poison in his ears.


  Ham. He poisons him i' th' garden for's estate. His name's
Gonzago.
    The story is extant, 
and written in very choice Italian. You
    shall see anon how the murtherer gets the love of Gonza
go's
wife.
  Oph. The King rises.
  Ham. What, frighted with false fire?
  Queen. How fares my l
ord?
  Pol. Give o'er the play.
  King. Give me some light! Away!
  All. Lights, lights, lights!

                              Exeunt all but Hamlet and Horatio.
  Ham.   Why, let the strucken de
er go weep,
          The hart ungalled play;
         For some must watch, while some must sleep:

          Thus runs the world away.
    Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers- if the res
t of
my
    fortunes turn Turk with me-with two Provincial roses on my
raz'd
    shoes, get me a
 fellowship in a cry of players, sir?
  Hor. Half a share.
  Ham.   A whole one I!
         For t
hou dost know, O Damon dear,
           This realm dismantled was
         Of Jove himself; and no
w reigns here
           A very, very- pajock.
  Hor. You might have rhym'd.
  Ham. O good Horati
o, I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand
    pound! Didst perceive?
  Hor. Very well, my lord.

  Ham. Upon the talk of the poisoning?
  Hor. I did very well note him.
  Ham.   Aha! Come, some
 music! Come, the recorders!
         For if the King like not the comedy,
         Why then, beli
ke he likes it not, perdy.
    Come, some music!

                Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenst
ern.

  Guil. Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.
  Ham. Sir, a whole history.
  Guil. T
he King, sir-
  Ham. Ay, sir, what of him?
  Guil. Is in his retirement, marvellous distemper'd.

  Ham. With drink, sir?
  Guil. No, my lord; rather with choler.
  Ham. Your wisdom should show it
self more richer to signify this
to
    the doctor; for me to put him to his purgation would perha
ps
    plunge him into far more choler.
  Guil. Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame, 
and
start
    not so wildly from my affair.
  Ham. I am tame, sir; pronounce.
  Guil. The Queen,
 your mother, in most great affliction of
spirit
    hath sent me to you.
  Ham. You are welcome.

  Guil. Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right
breed.
    If it shall please you t
o make me a wholesome answer, I will
do
    your mother's commandment; if not, your pardon and my 
return
    shall be the end of my business.
  Ham. Sir, I cannot.
  Guil. What, my lord?
  Ham. 
Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseas'd. But, sir,
such
    answer as I can make, you shall
 command; or rather, as you
say,
    my mother. Therefore no more, but to the matter! My mother,

you
    say-
  Ros. Then thus she says: your behaviour hath struck her into
    amazement and adm
iration.
  Ham. O wonderful son, that can so stonish a mother! But is
there no
    sequel at the 
heels of this mother's admiration? Impart.
  Ros. She desires to speak with you in her closet ere y
ou go to
bed.
  Ham. We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any
    further trade
 with us?
  Ros. My lord, you once did love me.
  Ham. And do still, by these pickers and stealers
!
  Ros. Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? You do
surely
    bar the door upon your 
own liberty, if you deny your griefs
to
    your friend.
  Ham. Sir, I lack advancement.
  Ros. 
How can that be, when you have the voice of the King
himself
    for your succession in Denmark?

  Ham. Ay, sir, but 'while the grass grows'- the proverb is
something
    musty.

              
       Enter the Players with recorders.

    O, the recorders! Let me see one. To withdraw with y
ou- why
do
    you go about to recover the wind of me, as if you would drive
me
    into a toil?

  Guil. O my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too
unmannerly.
  Ham. I do not well under
stand that. Will you play upon this
pipe?
  Guil. My lord, I cannot.
  Ham. I pray you.
  Guil. 
Believe me, I cannot.
  Ham. I do beseech you.
  Guil. I know, no touch of it, my lord.
  Ham. It
 is as easy as lying. Govern these ventages with your
    fingers and thumbs, give it breath with y
our mouth, and it
will
    discourse most eloquent music. Look you, these are the stops.
  Guil. 
But these cannot I command to any utt'rance of harmony. I
    have not the skill.
  Ham. Why, look
 you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me!
You
    would play upon me; you would seem to know 
my stops; you
would
    pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound me from my
    lowest 
note to the top of my compass; and there is much
music,
    excellent voice, in this little organ,
 yet cannot you make it
    speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am easier to be play'd on than
a
    p
ipe? Call me what instrument you will, though you can fret
me,
    you cannot play upon me.

   
                     Enter Polonius.

    God bless you, sir!
  Pol. My lord, the Queen would spe
ak with you, and presently.
  Ham. Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
  Po
l. By th' mass, and 'tis like a camel indeed.
  Ham. Methinks it is like a weasel.
  Pol. It is ba
ck'd like a weasel.
  Ham. Or like a whale.
  Pol. Very like a whale.
  Ham. Then will I come to 
my mother by-and-by.- They fool me to
the
    top of my bent.- I will come by-and-by.
  Pol. I wi
ll say so.                                      Exit.
  Ham. 'By-and-by' is easily said.- Leave me,
 friends.
                                        [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]

    'Tis now the very
 witching time of night,
    When churchyards yawn, and hell itself breathes out
    Contagion to 
this world. Now could I drink hot blood
    And do such bitter business as the day
    Would quake
 to look on. Soft! now to my mother!
    O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever
    The soul o
f Nero enter this firm bosom.
    Let me be cruel, not unnatural;
    I will speak daggers to her,
 but use none.
    My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites-
    How in my words somever she be sh
ent,
    To give them seals never, my soul, consent!             Exit.




Scene III.
A room 
in the Castle.

Enter King, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.

  King. I like him not, nor stands i
t safe with us
    To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;
    I your commission will for
thwith dispatch,
    And he to England shall along with you.
    The terms of our estate may not e
ndure
    Hazard so near us as doth hourly grow
    Out of his lunacies.
  Guil. We will ourselve
s provide.
    Most holy and religious fear it is
    To keep those many many bodies safe
    Tha
t live and feed upon your Majesty.
  Ros. The single and peculiar life is bound
    With all the s
trength and armour of the mind
    To keep itself from noyance; but much more
    That spirit upon
 whose weal depends and rests
    The lives of many. The cesse of majesty
    Dies not alone, but 
like a gulf doth draw
    What's near it with it. It is a massy wheel,
    Fix'd on the summit of 
the highest mount,
    To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
    Are mortis'd and adjoin
'd; which when it falls,
    Each small annexment, petty consequence,
    Attends the boist'rous r
uin. Never alone
    Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.
  King. Arm you, I pray you, to 
this speedy voyage;
    For we will fetters put upon this fear,
    Which now goes too free-footed
.
  Both. We will haste us.
                                               Exeunt Gentlemen.

  
                 Enter Polonius.

  Pol. My lord, he's going to his mother's closet.
    Behind t
he arras I'll convey myself
    To hear the process. I'll warrant she'll tax him home;
    And, as
 you said, and wisely was it said,
    'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,
    Since 
nature makes them partial, should o'erhear
    The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege.
  
  I'll call upon you ere you go to bed
    And tell you what I know.
  King. Thanks, dear my lord.

                                                Exit [Polonius].
    O, my offence is rank, it sm
ells to heaven;
    It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,
    A brother's murther! Pray can I no
t,
    Though inclination be as sharp as will.
    My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent,
  
  And, like a man to double business bound,
    I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
    An
d both neglect. What if this cursed hand
    Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,
    Is
 there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
    To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
   
 But to confront the visage of offence?
    And what's in prayer but this twofold force,
    To be
 forestalled ere we come to fall,
    Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;
    My fault is p
ast. But, O, what form of prayer
    Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murther'?
    That can
not be; since I am still possess'd
    Of those effects for which I did the murther-
    My crown,
 mine own ambition, and my queen.
    May one be pardon'd and retain th' offence?
    In the corru
pted currents of this world
    Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,
    And oft 'tis seen 
the wicked prize itself
    Buys out the law; but 'tis not so above.
    There is no shuffling; th
ere the action lies
    In his true nature, and we ourselves compell'd,
    Even to the teeth and 
forehead of our faults,
    To give in evidence. What then? What rests?
    Try what repentance ca
n. What can it not?
    Yet what can it when one cannot repent?
    O wretched state! O bosom blac
k as death!
    O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
    Art more engag'd! Help, angels! Mak
e assay.
    Bow, stubborn knees; and heart with strings of steel,
    Be soft as sinews of the ne
w-born babe!
    All may be well.                                  He kneels.

                  
       Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
    And now I'll do't. And
 so he goes to heaven,
    And so am I reveng'd. That would be scann'd.
    A villain kills my fat
her; and for that,
    I, his sole son, do this same villain send
    To heaven.
    Why, this is
 hire and salary, not revenge!
    He took my father grossly, full of bread,
    With all his crim
es broad blown, as flush as May;
    And how his audit stands, who knows save heaven?
    But in o
ur circumstance and course of thought,
    'Tis heavy with him; and am I then reveng'd,
    To tak
e him in the purging of his soul,
    When he is fit and seasoned for his passage?
    No.
    Up
, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent.
    When he is drunk asleep; or in his rage;
    Or in 
th' incestuous pleasure of his bed;
    At gaming, swearing, or about some act
    That has no rel
ish of salvation in't-
    Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,
    And that his soul
 may be as damn'd and black
    As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays.
    This physic but pro
longs thy sickly days.              Exit.
  King. [rises] My words fly up, my thoughts remain below
.
    Words without thoughts never to heaven go.             Exit.




Scene IV.
The Queen's 
closet.

Enter Queen and Polonius.

  Pol. He will come straight. Look you lay home to him.
   
 Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,
    And that your Grace hath screen'd and st
ood between
    Much heat and him. I'll silence me even here.
    Pray you be round with him.
  H
am. (within) Mother, mother, mother!
  Queen. I'll warrant you; fear me not. Withdraw; I hear him

coming.
                              [Polonius hides behind the arras.]

                       
   Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Now, mother, what's the matter?
  Queen. Hamlet, thou hast thy father mu
ch offended.
  Ham. Mother, you have my father much offended.
  Queen. Come, come, you answer with
 an idle tongue.
  Ham. Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
  Queen. Why, how now, Hamlet?

  Ham. What's the matter now?
  Queen. Have you forgot me?
  Ham. No, by the rood, not so!
    Y
ou are the Queen, your husband's brother's wife,
    And (would it were not so!) you are my mother.

  Queen. Nay, then I'll set those to you that can speak.
  Ham. Come, come, and sit you down. You
 shall not budge;
    You go not till I set you up a glass
    Where you may see the inmost part o
f you.
  Queen. What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murther me?
    Help, help, ho!
  Pol. [behind] 
What, ho! help, help, help!
  Ham. [draws] How now? a rat? Dead for a ducat, dead!
            [Ma
kes a pass through the arras and] kills Polonius.
  Pol. [behind] O, I am slain!
  Queen. O me, wh
at hast thou done?
  Ham. Nay, I know not. Is it the King?
  Queen. O, what a rash and bloody deed
 is this!
  Ham. A bloody deed- almost as bad, good mother,
    As kill a king, and marry with his
 brother.
  Queen. As kill a king?
  Ham. Ay, lady, it was my word.
                         [Lif
ts up the arras and sees Polonius.]
    Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
    I took 
thee for thy better. Take thy fortune.
    Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.
    Leave w
ringing of your hands. Peace! sit you down
    And let me wring your heart; for so I shall
    If 
it be made of penetrable stuff;
    If damned custom have not braz'd it so
    That it is proof an
d bulwark against sense.
  Queen. What have I done that thou dar'st wag thy tongue
    In noise so
 rude against me?
  Ham. Such an act
    That blurs the grace and blush of modesty;
    Calls vir
tue hypocrite; takes off the rose
    From the fair forehead of an innocent love,
    And sets a b
lister there; makes marriage vows
    As false as dicers' oaths. O, such a deed
    As from the bo
dy of contraction plucks
    The very soul, and sweet religion makes
    A rhapsody of words! Heav
en's face doth glow;
    Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
    With tristful visage, as agains
t the doom,
    Is thought-sick at the act.
  Queen. Ah me, what act,
    That roars so loud and 
thunders in the index?
  Ham. Look here upon th's picture, and on this,
    The counterfeit presen
tment of two brothers.
    See what a grace was seated on this brow;
    Hyperion's curls; the fro
nt of Jove himself;
    An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
    A station like the herald M
ercury
    New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill:
    A combination and a form indeed
    Where ev
ery god did seem to set his seal
    To give the world assurance of a man.
    This was your husba
nd. Look you now what follows.
    Here is your husband, like a mildew'd ear
    Blasting his whol
esome brother. Have you eyes?
    Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
    And batten on
 this moor? Ha! have you eyes
    You cannot call it love; for at your age
    The heyday in the b
lood is tame, it's humble,
    And waits upon the judgment; and what judgment
    Would step from 
this to this? Sense sure you have,
    Else could you not have motion; but sure that sense
    Is 
apoplex'd; for madness would not err,
    Nor sense to ecstacy was ne'er so thrall'd
    But it re
serv'd some quantity of choice
    To serve in such a difference. What devil was't
    That thus h
ath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
    Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
    Ears withou
t hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
    Or but a sickly part of one true sense
    Could not so mo
pe.
    O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
    If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones
,
    To flaming youth let virtue be as wax
    And melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame
    W
hen the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
    Since frost itself as actively doth burn,
    And 
reason panders will.
  Queen. O Hamlet, speak no more!
    Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very sou
l,
    And there I see such black and grained spots
    As will not leave their tinct.
  Ham. Nay
, but to live
    In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
    Stew'd in corruption, honeying and mak
ing love
    Over the nasty sty!
  Queen. O, speak to me no more!
    These words like daggers en
ter in mine ears.
    No more, sweet Hamlet!
  Ham. A murtherer and a villain!
    A slave that i
s not twentieth part the tithe
    Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
    A cutpurse of the 
empire and the rule,
    That from a shelf the precious diadem stole
    And put it in his pocket!

  Queen. No more!

                Enter the Ghost in his nightgown.

  Ham. A king of shreds 
and patches!-
    Save me and hover o'er me with your wings,
    You heavenly guards! What would y
our gracious figure?
  Queen. Alas, he's mad!
  Ham. Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
   
 That, laps'd in time and passion, lets go by
    Th' important acting of your dread command?
    
O, say!
  Ghost. Do not forget. This visitation
    Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
  
  But look, amazement on thy mother sits.
    O, step between her and her fighting soul
    Concei
t in weakest bodies strongest works.
    Speak to her, Hamlet.
  Ham. How is it with you, lady?
 
 Queen. Alas, how is't with you,
    That you do bend your eye on vacancy,
    And with th' encorp
oral air do hold discourse?
    Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
    And, as the sleep
ing soldiers in th' alarm,
    Your bedded hairs, like life in excrements,
    Start up and stand 
an end. O gentle son,
    Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
    Sprinkle cool patience! Whe
reon do you look?
  Ham. On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!
    His form and cause conjo
in'd, preaching to stones,
    Would make them capable.- Do not look upon me,
    Lest with this p
iteous action you convert
    My stern effects. Then what I have to do
    Will want true colour- 
tears perchance for blood.
  Queen. To whom do you speak this?
  Ham. Do you see nothing there?
 
 Queen. Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
  Ham. Nor did you nothing hear?
  Queen. No, nothi
ng but ourselves.
  Ham. Why, look you there! Look how it steals away!
    My father, in his habit
 as he liv'd!
    Look where he goes even now out at the portal!
                                 
                    Exit Ghost.
  Queen. This is the very coinage of your brain.
    This bodiless
 creation ecstasy
    Is very cunning in.
  Ham. Ecstasy?
    My pulse as yours doth temperately 
keep time
    And makes as healthful music. It is not madness
    That I have utt'red. Bring me to
 the test,
    And I the matter will reword; which madness
    Would gambol from. Mother, for love
 of grace,
    Lay not that flattering unction to your soul
    That not your trespass but my madn
ess speaks.
    It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
    Whiles rank corruption, mining a
ll within,
    Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
    Repent what's past; avoid what is t
o come;
    And do not spread the compost on the weeds
    To make them ranker. Forgive me this my
 virtue;
    For in the fatness of these pursy times
    Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg-
 
   Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.
  Queen. O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain
.
  Ham. O, throw away the worser part of it,
    And live the purer with the other half,
    Goo
d night- but go not to my uncle's bed.
    Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
    That monster, 
custom, who all sense doth eat
    Of habits evil, is angel yet in this,
    That to the use of ac
tions fair and good
    He likewise gives a frock or livery,
    That aptly is put on. Refrain to-
night,
    And that shall lend a kind of easiness
    To the next abstinence; the next more easy;

    For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
    And either [master] the devil, or throw him
 out
    With wondrous potency. Once more, good night;
    And when you are desirous to be blest,

    I'll blessing beg of you.- For this same lord,
    I do repent; but heaven hath pleas'd it so,

    To punish me with this, and this with me,
    That I must be their scourge and minister.
   
 I will bestow him, and will answer well
    The death I gave him. So again, good night.
    I mus
t be cruel, only to be kind;
    Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.
    One word more, goo
d lady.
  Queen. What shall I do?
  Ham. Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
    Let the bl
oat King tempt you again to bed;
    Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
    And let h
im, for a pair of reechy kisses,
    Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,
    Make yo
u to ravel all this matter out,
    That I essentially am not in madness,
    But mad in craft. 'T
were good you let him know;
    For who that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
    Would from a pa
ddock, from a bat, a gib
    Such dear concernings hide? Who would do so?
    No, in despite of se
nse and secrecy,
    Unpeg the basket on the house's top,
    Let the birds fly, and like the famo
us ape,
    To try conclusions, in the basket creep
    And break your own neck down.
  Queen. Be
 thou assur'd, if words be made of breath,
    And breath of life, I have no life to breathe
    W
hat thou hast said to me.
  Ham. I must to England; you know that?
  Queen. Alack,
    I had forg
ot! 'Tis so concluded on.
  Ham. There's letters seal'd; and my two schoolfellows,
    Whom I will
 trust as I will adders fang'd,
    They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way
    And marshal 
me to knavery. Let it work;
    For 'tis the sport to have the enginer
    Hoist with his own peta
r; and 't shall go hard
    But I will delve one yard below their mines
    And blow them at the m
oon. O, 'tis most sweet
    When in one line two crafts directly meet.
    This man shall set me p
acking.
    I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.-
    Mother, good night.- Indeed, this coun
sellor
    Is now most still, most secret, and most grave,
    Who was in life a foolish peating k
nave.
    Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.
    Good night, mother.
                  [E
xit the Queen. Then] Exit Hamlet, tugging in
                                                      
 Polonius.

ACT IV. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King and 
Queen, with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  King. There's matter in these sighs. These profound h
eaves
    You must translate; 'tis fit we understand them.
    Where is your son?
  Queen. Bestow
 this place on us a little while.
                          [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]

    Ah, mine own lord, what have I seen to-night!
  King. What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
  Quee
n. Mad as the sea and wind when both contend
    Which is the mightier. In his lawless fit
    Beh
ind the arras hearing something stir,
    Whips out his rapier, cries 'A rat, a rat!'
    And in t
his brainish apprehension kills
    The unseen good old man.
  King. O heavy deed!
    It had bee
n so with us, had we been there.
    His liberty is full of threats to all-
    To you yourself, t
o us, to every one.
    Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
    It will be laid to us, w
hose providence
    Should have kept short, restrain'd, and out of haunt
    This mad young man. B
ut so much was our love
    We would not understand what was most fit,
    But, like the owner of 
a foul disease,
    To keep it from divulging, let it feed
    Even on the pith of life. Where is 
he gone?
  Queen. To draw apart the body he hath kill'd;
    O'er whom his very madness, like some
 ore
    Among a mineral of metals base,
    Shows itself pure. He weeps for what is done.
  King
. O Gertrude, come away!
    The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch
    But we will ship him 
hence; and this vile deed
    We must with all our majesty and skill
    Both countenance and excu
se. Ho, Guildenstern!

             Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

    Friends both, go jo
in you with some further aid.
    Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
    And from his mother's
 closet hath he dragg'd him.
    Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body
    Into the chap
el. I pray you haste in this.
                          Exeunt [Rosencrantz and Guildenstern].
   
 Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends
    And let them know both what we mean to do
  
  And what's untimely done. [So haply slander-]
    Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter,
    A
s level as the cannon to his blank,
    Transports his poisoned shot- may miss our name
    And hi
t the woundless air.- O, come away!
    My soul is full of discord and dismay.
                   
                                      Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A passage in the Castle.


Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Safely stow'd.
  Gentlemen. (within) Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!
  Ham. But s
oft! What noise? Who calls on Hamlet? O, here they
come.

               Enter Rosencrantz and Gu
ildenstern.

  Ros. What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
  Ham. Compounded it with du
st, whereto 'tis kin.
  Ros. Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
    And bear it to the
 chapel.
  Ham. Do not believe it.
  Ros. Believe what?
  Ham. That I can keep your counsel, and 
not mine own. Besides,
to be
    demanded of a sponge, what replication should be made by the
son

    of a king?
  Ros. Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
  Ham. Ay, sir; that soaks up the King'
s countenance, his
rewards,
    his authorities. But such officers do the King best service
in
 
   the end. He keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his
jaw;
    first mouth'd, to be last sw
allowed. When he needs what you
have
    glean'd, it is but squeezing you and, sponge, you shall b
e
dry
    again.
  Ros. I understand you not, my lord.
  Ham. I am glad of it. A knavish speech 
sleeps in a foolish ear.
  Ros. My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us
to
   
 the King.
  Ham. The body is with the King, but the King is not with the
body.
    The King is a
 thing-
  Guil. A thing, my lord?
  Ham. Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.
  
                                                       Exeunt.




Scene III.
Elsinore. A room
 in the Castle.

Enter King.

  King. I have sent to seek him and to find the body.
    How dan
gerous is it that this man goes loose!
    Yet must not we put the strong law on him.
    He's lov
'd of the distracted multitude,
    Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;
    And where 
'tis so, th' offender's scourge is weigh'd,
    But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,

    This sudden sending him away must seem
    Deliberate pause. Diseases desperate grown
    By
 desperate appliance are reliev'd,
    Or not at all.

                    Enter Rosencrantz.


    How now O What hath befall'n?
  Ros. Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
    We cannot g
et from him.
  King. But where is he?
  Ros. Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
  
King. Bring him before us.
  Ros. Ho, Guildenstern! Bring in my lord.

        Enter Hamlet and G
uildenstern [with Attendants].

  King. Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
  Ham. At supper.
  King.
 At supper? Where?
  Ham. Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A certain
    convocation of p
olitic worms are e'en at him. Your worm is
your
    only emperor for diet. We fat all creatures el
se to fat us,
and
    we fat ourselves for maggots. Your fat king and your lean
beggar
    is bu
t variable service- two dishes, but to one table. That's
the
    end.
  King. Alas, alas!
  Ham.
 A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and
eat
    of the fish that hath fed of th
at worm.
  King. What dost thou mean by this?
  Ham. Nothing but to show you how a king may go a p
rogress
through
    the guts of a beggar.
  King. Where is Polonius?
  Ham. In heaven. Send thit
her to see. If your messenger find him
not
    there, seek him i' th' other place yourself. But in
deed, if
you
    find him not within this month, you shall nose him as you go
up
    the stair, 
into the lobby.
  King. Go seek him there. [To Attendants.]
  Ham. He will stay till you come.
  
                                          [Exeunt Attendants.]
  King. Hamlet, this deed, for thine
 especial safety,-
    Which we do tender as we dearly grieve
    For that which thou hast done,- 
must send thee hence
    With fiery quickness. Therefore prepare thyself.
    The bark is ready an
d the wind at help,
    Th' associates tend, and everything is bent
    For England.
  Ham. For E
ngland?
  King. Ay, Hamlet.
  Ham. Good.
  King. So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
  Ham. 
I see a cherub that sees them. But come, for England!
    Farewell, dear mother.
  King. Thy lovin
g father, Hamlet.
  Ham. My mother! Father and mother is man and wife; man and wife
is
    one fl
esh; and so, my mother. Come, for England!
Exit.
  King. Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed 
aboard.
    Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night.
    Away! for everything is seal'd and don
e
    That else leans on th' affair. Pray you make haste.
                            Exeunt Rosen
crantz and Guildenstern]
    And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught,-
    As my great powe
r thereof may give thee sense,
    Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
    After the Danish 
sword, and thy free awe
    Pays homage to us,- thou mayst not coldly set
    Our sovereign proces
s, which imports at full,
    By letters congruing to that effect,
    The present death of Hamlet
. Do it, England;
    For like the hectic in my blood he rages,
    And thou must cure me. Till I 
know 'tis done,
    Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.             Exit.

Scene IV.
Near Elsinore.

Enter Fortinbras with his Army over the stage.

  For. Go, Captain
, from me greet the Danish king.
    Tell him that by his license Fortinbras
    Craves the convey
ance of a promis'd march
    Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.
    If that his Majesty wo
uld aught with us,
    We shall express our duty in his eye;
    And let him know so.
  Capt. I w
ill do't, my lord.
  For. Go softly on.
                                   Exeunt [all but the Cap
tain].

       Enter Hamlet, Rosencrantz, [Guildenstern,] and others.

  Ham. Good sir, whose po
wers are these?
  Capt. They are of Norway, sir.
  Ham. How purpos'd, sir, I pray you?
  Capt. Ag
ainst some part of Poland.
  Ham. Who commands them, sir?
  Capt. The nephew to old Norway, Fortin
bras.
  Ham. Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
    Or for some frontier?
  Capt. Truly to 
speak, and with no addition,
    We go to gain a little patch of ground
    That hath in it no pro
fit but the name.
    To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
    Nor will it yield to Norw
ay or the Pole
    A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
  Ham. Why, then the Polack never will
 defend it.
  Capt. Yes, it is already garrison'd.
  Ham. Two thousand souls and twenty thousand d
ucats
    Will not debate the question of this straw.
    This is th' imposthume of much wealth an
d peace,
    That inward breaks, and shows no cause without
    Why the man dies.- I humbly thank 
you, sir.
  Capt. God b' wi' you, sir.                             [Exit.]
  Ros. Will't please yo
u go, my lord?
  Ham. I'll be with you straight. Go a little before.
                             
           [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]
    How all occasions do inform against me
    And spur my dul
l revenge! What is a man,
    If his chief good and market of his time
    Be but to sleep and fee
d? A beast, no more.
    Sure he that made us with such large discourse,
    Looking before and af
ter, gave us not
    That capability and godlike reason
    To fust in us unus'd. Now, whether it 
be
    Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple
    Of thinking too precisely on th' event,-
    
A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
    And ever three parts coward,- I do not kno
w
    Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do,'
    Sith I have cause, and will, and strength, a
nd means
    To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me.
    Witness this army of such mass and ch
arge,
    Led by a delicate and tender prince,
    Whose spirit, with divine ambition puff'd,
   
 Makes mouths at the invisible event,
    Exposing what is mortal and unsure
    To all that fortu
ne, death, and danger dare,
    Even for an eggshell. Rightly to be great
    Is not to stir witho
ut great argument,
    But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
    When honour's at the stake. How 
stand I then,
    That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,
    Excitements of my reason and my
 blood,
    And let all sleep, while to my shame I see
    The imminent death of twenty thousand m
en
    That for a fantasy and trick of fame
    Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot
  
  Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
    Which is not tomb enough and continent
    To hide
 the slain? O, from this time forth,
    My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!            Exi
t.

Scene V.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter Horatio, Queen, and a Gen
tleman.

  Queen. I will not speak with her.
  Gent. She is importunate, indeed distract.
    He
r mood will needs be pitied.
  Queen. What would she have?
  Gent. She speaks much of her father; 
says she hears
    There's tricks i' th' world, and hems, and beats her heart;
    Spurns enviousl
y at straws; speaks things in doubt,
    That carry but half sense. Her speech is nothing,
    Yet
 the unshaped use of it doth move
    The hearers to collection; they aim at it,
    And botch the
 words up fit to their own thoughts;
    Which, as her winks and nods and gestures yield them,
   
 Indeed would make one think there might be thought,
    Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.

  Hor. 'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew
    Dangerous conjectures in ill-breedin
g minds.
  Queen. Let her come in.
                                               [Exit Gentleman.
]
    [Aside] To my sick soul (as sin's true nature is)
    Each toy seems Prologue to some great 
amiss.
    So full of artless jealousy is guilt
    It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.

  
               Enter Ophelia distracted.

  Oph. Where is the beauteous Majesty of Denmark?
  Que
en. How now, Ophelia?
  Oph. (sings)
         How should I your true-love know
           From an
other one?
         By his cockle bat and' staff
           And his sandal shoon.

  Queen. Alas
, sweet lady, what imports this song?
  Oph. Say you? Nay, pray You mark.

    (Sings) He is dead
 and gone, lady,
              He is dead and gone;
            At his head a grass-green turf,
 
             At his heels a stone.

    O, ho!
  Queen. Nay, but Ophelia-
  Oph. Pray you mark.


    (Sings) White his shroud as the mountain snow-

                    Enter King.

  Queen.
 Alas, look here, my lord!
  Oph. (Sings)
           Larded all with sweet flowers;
         Whic
h bewept to the grave did not go
           With true-love showers.

  King. How do you, pretty l
ady?
  Oph. Well, God dild you! They say the owl was a baker's
daughter.
    Lord, we know what w
e are, but know not what we may be. God
be at
    your table!
  King. Conceit upon her father.
 
 Oph. Pray let's have no words of this; but when they ask, you
what
    it means, say you this:


    (Sings) To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,
              All in the morning bedtime,
       
     And I a maid at your window,
              To be your Valentine.

            Then up he ros
e and donn'd his clo'es
              And dupp'd the chamber door,
            Let in the maid, th
at out a maid
              Never departed more.

  King. Pretty Ophelia!
  Oph. Indeed, la, wit
hout an oath, I'll make an end on't!

    [Sings] By Gis and by Saint Charity,
              Alac
k, and fie for shame!
            Young men will do't if they come to't
              By Cock, the
y are to blame.

            Quoth she, 'Before you tumbled me,
              You promis'd me to 
wed.'

    He answers:

            'So would I 'a' done, by yonder sun,
              An thou 
hadst not come to my bed.'

  King. How long hath she been thus?
  Oph. I hope all will be well. 
We must be patient; but I cannot
    choose but weep to think they would lay him i' th' cold
groun
d.
    My brother shall know of it; and so I thank you for your good
    counsel. Come, my coach! 
Good night, ladies. Good night,
sweet
    ladies. Good night, good night.                         
Exit
  King. Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.
                                  
               [Exit Horatio.]

    O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs
    All from 
her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
    When sorrows come, they come not single spies.
    B
ut in battalions! First, her father slain;
    Next, your son gone, and he most violent author
   
 Of his own just remove; the people muddied,
    Thick and and unwholesome in their thoughts and wh
ispers
    For good Polonius' death, and we have done but greenly
    In hugger-mugger to inter hi
m; poor Ophelia
    Divided from herself and her fair judgment,
    Without the which we are pictu
res or mere beasts;
    Last, and as much containing as all these,
    Her brother is in secret co
me from France;
    And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
    Feeds on his wonder, keep, himself
 in clouds,
    With pestilent speeches of his father's death,
    Wherein necessity, of matter be
ggar'd,
    Will nothing stick our person to arraign
    In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,

    Like to a murd'ring piece, in many places
    Give me superfluous death.                  A n
oise within.
  Queen. Alack, what noise is this?
  King. Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the
 door.

                     Enter a Messenger.

    What is the matter?
  Mess. Save Yourself,
 my lord:
    The ocean, overpeering of his list,
    Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste

    Than Young Laertes, in a riotous head,
    O'erbears Your offices. The rabble call him lord;

    And, as the world were now but to begin,
    Antiquity forgot, custom not known,
    The rati
fiers and props of every word,
    They cry 'Choose we! Laertes shall be king!'
    Caps, hands, a
nd tongues applaud it to the clouds,
    'Laertes shall be king! Laertes king!'
                  
                               A noise within.
  Queen. How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!

    O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!
  King. The doors are broke.

                  
  Enter Laertes with others.

  Laer. Where is this king?- Sirs, staid you all without.
  All. No
, let's come in!
  Laer. I pray you give me leave.
  All. We will, we will!
  Laer. I thank you. 
Keep the door.      [Exeunt his Followers.]
    O thou vile king,
    Give me my father!
  Queen.
 Calmly, good Laertes.
  Laer. That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard;
    Cries cuck
old to my father; brands the harlot
    Even here between the chaste unsmirched brows
    Of my tr
ue mother.
  King. What is the cause, Laertes,
    That thy rebellion looks so giantlike?
    Let
 him go, Gertrude. Do not fear our person.
    There's such divinity doth hedge a king
    That tr
eason can but peep to what it would,
    Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,
    Why thou a
rt thus incens'd. Let him go, Gertrude.
    Speak, man.
  Laer. Where is my father?
  King. Dead.

  Queen. But not by him!
  King. Let him demand his fill.
  Laer. How came he dead? I'll not be 
juggled with:
    To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil
    Conscience and grace, to th
e profoundest pit!
    I dare damnation. To this point I stand,
    That both the world, I give to
 negligence,
    Let come what comes; only I'll be reveng'd
    Most throughly for my father.
  K
ing. Who shall stay you?
  Laer. My will, not all the world!
    And for my means, I'll husband th
em so well
    They shall go far with little.
  King. Good Laertes,
    If you desire to know the
 certainty
    Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge
    That sweepstake you will
 draw both friend and foe,
    Winner and loser?
  Laer. None but his enemies.
  King. Will you k
now them then?
  Laer. To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms
    And, like the kind life-
rend'ring pelican,
    Repast them with my blood.
  King. Why, now You speak
    Like a good chil
d and a true gentleman.
    That I am guiltless of your father's death,
    And am most sensibly i
n grief for it,
    It shall as level to your judgment pierce
    As day does to your eye.
      
                        A noise within: 'Let her come in.'
  Laer. How now? What noise is that?


                      Enter Ophelia.

    O heat, dry up my brains! Tears seven times salt
    Bu
rn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!
    By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight
    Ti
ll our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!
    Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
    O heaven
s! is't possible a young maid's wits
    Should be as mortal as an old man's life?
    Nature is f
ine in love, and where 'tis fine,
    It sends some precious instance of itself
    After the thin
g it loves.

  Oph. (sings)
         They bore him barefac'd on the bier
           (Hey non non
y, nony, hey nony)
         And in his grave rain'd many a tear.

    Fare you well, my dove!
  
Laer. Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
    It could not move thus.
  Oph. You must
 sing 'A-down a-down, and you call him a-down-a.'
O,
    how the wheel becomes it! It is the false
 steward, that stole
his
    master's daughter.
  Laer. This nothing's more than matter.
  Oph. 
There's rosemary, that's for remembrance. Pray you, love,
    remember. And there is pansies, that'
s for thoughts.
  Laer. A document in madness! Thoughts and remembrance fitted.
  Oph. There's fen
nel for you, and columbines. There's rue for
you,
    and here's some for me. We may call it herb 
of grace o'
Sundays.
    O, you must wear your rue with a difference! There's a daisy.
I
    wou
ld give you some violets, but they wither'd all when my
father
    died. They say he made a good e
nd.

    [Sings] For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.

  Laer. Thought and affliction, passion, 
hell itself,
    She turns to favour and to prettiness.
  Oph. (sings)
         And will he not c
ome again?
         And will he not come again?
           No, no, he is dead;
           Go to t
hy deathbed;
         He never will come again.

         His beard was as white as snow,
      
   All flaxen was his poll.
           He is gone, he is gone,
           And we cast away moan.

         God 'a'mercy on his soul!

    And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God b' wi' you.
E
xit.
  Laer. Do you see this, O God?
  King. Laertes, I must commune with your grief,
    Or you 
deny me right. Go but apart,
    Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will,
    And they sh
all hear and judge 'twixt you and me.
    If by direct or by collateral hand
    They find us touc
h'd, we will our kingdom give,
    Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours,
    To you in s
atisfaction; but if not,
    Be you content to lend your patience to us,
    And we shall jointly 
labour with your soul
    To give it due content.
  Laer. Let this be so.
    His means of death,
 his obscure funeral-
    No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,
    No noble rite nor fo
rmal ostentation,-
    Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
    That I must call't in 
question.
  King. So you shall;
    And where th' offence is let the great axe fall.
    I pray y
ou go with me.
                                                          Exeunt

Scene VI.
Elsinore. Another room in the Castle.

Enter Horatio with an Attendant.

  Hor. Wha
t are they that would speak with me?
  Servant. Seafaring men, sir. They say they have letters for

you.
  Hor. Let them come in.
                                               [Exit Attendant.]
 
   I do not know from what part of the world
    I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.

 
                         Enter Sailors.

  Sailor. God bless you, sir.
  Hor. Let him bless thee 
too.
  Sailor. 'A shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter for
you,
    sir,- it comes from 
th' ambassador that was bound for
England- if
    your name be Horatio, as I am let to know it is.

  Hor. (reads the letter) 'Horatio, when thou shalt have
overlook'd
    this, give these fellows
 some means to the King. They have
    letters for him. Ere we were two days old at sea, a pirate o
f

    very warlike appointment gave us chase. Finding ourselves too
    slow of sail, we put on 
a compelled valour, and in the
grapple I
    boarded them. On the instant they got clear of our sh
ip; so I
    alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with me like
thieves
    of mercy; but 
they knew what they did: I am to do a good turn
for
    them. Let the King have the letters I have
 sent, and repair
thou
    to me with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death. I have
words
    
to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb; yet are they much
too
    light for the bore of the mat
ter. These good fellows will
bring
    thee where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their
c
ourse
    for England. Of them I have much to tell thee. Farewell.
                            'He
 that thou knowest thine, HAMLET.'

    Come, I will give you way for these your letters,
    And
 do't the speedier that you may direct me
    To him from whom you brought them.                   
Exeunt.

Scene VII.
Elsinore. Another room in the Castle.

Enter King and Lae
rtes.

  King. Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
    And You must put me in your hear
t for friend,
    Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
    That he which hath your noble f
ather slain
    Pursued my life.
  Laer. It well appears. But tell me
    Why you proceeded not a
gainst these feats
    So crimeful and so capital in nature,
    As by your safety, wisdom, all th
ings else,
    You mainly were stirr'd up.
  King. O, for two special reasons,
    Which may to y
ou, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,
    But yet to me they are strong. The Queen his mother
    Live
s almost by his looks; and for myself,-
    My virtue or my plague, be it either which,-
    She's
 so conjunctive to my life and soul
    That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
    I could
 not but by her. The other motive
    Why to a public count I might not go
    Is the great love t
he general gender bear him,
    Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
    Would, like th
e spring that turneth wood to stone,
    Convert his gives to graces; so that my arrows,
    Too s
lightly timber'd for so loud a wind,
    Would have reverted to my bow again,
    And not where I 
had aim'd them.
  Laer. And so have I a noble father lost;
    A sister driven into desp'rate term
s,
    Whose worth, if praises may go back again,
    Stood challenger on mount of all the age
  
  For her perfections. But my revenge will come.
  King. Break not your sleeps for that. You must n
ot think
    That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
    That we can let our beard be shook wit
h danger,
    And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more.
    I lov'd your father, and we l
ove ourself,
    And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine-

                 Enter a Messenger
 with letters.

    How now? What news?
  Mess. Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:
    This to your 
Majesty; this to the Queen.
  King. From Hamlet? Who brought them?
  Mess. Sailors, my lord, they 
say; I saw them not.
    They were given me by Claudio; he receiv'd them
    Of him that brought t
hem.
  King. Laertes, you shall hear them.
    Leave us.
                                        
         Exit Messenger.
    [Reads]'High and Mighty,-You shall know I am set naked on
your
    k
ingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes;
    when I shall (first asking your pa
rdon thereunto) recount the
    occasion of my sudden and more strange return.
                   
                                  'HAMLET.'
    What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?

    Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?
  Laer. Know you the hand?
  King. 'Tis Hamlet's char
acter. 'Naked!'
    And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'
    Can you advise me?
  Laer. I a
m lost in it, my lord. But let him come!
    It warms the very sickness in my heart
    That I sha
ll live and tell him to his teeth,
    'Thus didest thou.'
  King. If it be so, Laertes
    (As h
ow should it be so? how otherwise?),
    Will you be rul'd by me?
  Laer. Ay my lord,
    So you 
will not o'errule me to a peace.
  King. To thine own peace. If he be now return'd
    As checking
 at his voyage, and that he means
    No more to undertake it, I will work him
    To exploit now 
ripe in my device,
    Under the which he shall not choose but fall;
    And for his death no wind
 shall breathe
    But even his mother shall uncharge the practice
    And call it accident.
  La
er. My lord, I will be rul'd;
    The rather, if you could devise it so
    That I might be the or
gan.
  King. It falls right.
    You have been talk'd of since your travel much,
    And that in 
Hamlet's hearing, for a quality
    Wherein they say you shine, Your sum of parts
    Did not toge
ther pluck such envy from him
    As did that one; and that, in my regard,
    Of the unworthiest 
siege.
  Laer. What part is that, my lord?
  King. A very riband in the cap of youth-
    Yet nee
dfull too; for youth no less becomes
    The light and careless livery that it wears
    Than sett
led age his sables and his weeds,
    Importing health and graveness. Two months since
    Here wa
s a gentleman of Normandy.
    I have seen myself, and serv'd against, the French,
    And they ca
n well on horseback; but this gallant
    Had witchcraft in't. He grew unto his seat,
    And to s
uch wondrous doing brought his horse
    As had he been incorps'd and demi-natur'd
    With the br
ave beast. So far he topp'd my thought
    That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
    Come short
 of what he did.
  Laer. A Norman was't?
  King. A Norman.
  Laer. Upon my life, Lamound.
  King
. The very same.
  Laer. I know him well. He is the broach indeed
    And gem of all the nation.

  King. He made confession of you;
    And gave you such a masterly report
    For art and exercis
e in your defence,
    And for your rapier most especially,
    That he cried out 'twould be a sig
ht indeed
    If one could match you. The scrimers of their nation
    He swore had neither motion
, guard, nor eye,
    If you oppos'd them. Sir, this report of his
    Did Hamlet so envenom with 
his envy
    That he could nothing do but wish and beg
    Your sudden coming o'er to play with yo
u.
    Now, out of this-
  Laer. What out of this, my lord?
  King. Laertes, was your father dear
 to you?
    Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
    A face without a heart,'
  Laer. Why a
sk you this?
  King. Not that I think you did not love your father;
    But that I know love is be
gun by time,
    And that I see, in passages of proof,
    Time qualifies the spark and fire of it
.
    There lives within the very flame of love
    A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
 
   And nothing is at a like goodness still;
    For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
    Dies in hi
s own too-much. That we would do,
    We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes,
    An
d hath abatements and delays as many
    As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
    And t
hen this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
    That hurts by easing. But to the quick o' th' ulc
er!
    Hamlet comes back. What would you undertake
    To show yourself your father's son in deed

    More than in words?
  Laer. To cut his throat i' th' church!
  King. No place indeed should 
murther sanctuarize;
    Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,
    Will you do this? K
eep close within your chamber.
    Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home.
    We'll put on 
those shall praise your excellence
    And set a double varnish on the fame
    The Frenchman gave
 you; bring you in fine together
    And wager on your heads. He, being remiss,
    Most generous,
 and free from all contriving,
    Will not peruse the foils; so that with ease,
    Or with a lit
tle shuffling, you may choose
    A sword unbated, and, in a pass of practice,
    Requite him for
 your father.
  Laer. I will do't!
    And for that purpose I'll anoint my sword.
    I bought an
 unction of a mountebank,
    So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
    Where it draws blood no c
ataplasm so rare,
    Collected from all simples that have virtue
    Under the moon, can save the
 thing from death
    This is but scratch'd withal. I'll touch my point
    With this contagion, t
hat, if I gall him slightly,
    It may be death.
  King. Let's further think of this,
    Weigh 
what convenience both of time and means
    May fit us to our shape. If this should fall,
    And 
that our drift look through our bad performance.
    'Twere better not assay'd. Therefore this proj
ect
    Should have a back or second, that might hold
    If this did blast in proof. Soft! let me
 see.
    We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings-
    I ha't!
    When in your motion you are
 hot and dry-
    As make your bouts more violent to that end-
    And that he calls for drink, I'
ll have prepar'd him
    A chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,
    If he by chance escape 
your venom'd stuck,
    Our purpose may hold there.- But stay, what noise,

                     
      Enter Queen.

    How now, sweet queen?
  Queen. One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
 
   So fast they follow. Your sister's drown'd, Laertes.
  Laer. Drown'd! O, where?
  Queen. There 
is a willow grows aslant a brook,
    That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream.
    There w
ith fantastic garlands did she come
    Of crowflowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,
    Th
at liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
    But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them.

    There on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds
    Clamb'ring to hang, an envious sliver broke,

    When down her weedy trophies and herself
    Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wid
e
    And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up;
    Which time she chaunted snatches of old tune
s,
    As one incapable of her own distress,
    Or like a creature native and indued
    Unto th
at element; but long it could not be
    Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
    Pull'
d the poor wretch from her melodious lay
    To muddy death.
  Laer. Alas, then she is drown'd?
 
 Queen. Drown'd, drown'd.
  Laer. Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
    And therefore I f
orbid my tears; but yet
    It is our trick; nature her custom holds,
    Let shame say what it wi
ll. When these are gone,
    The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord.
    I have a speech of fire, t
hat fain would blaze
    But that this folly douts it.                          Exit.
  King. Let'
s follow, Gertrude.
    How much I had to do to calm his rage I
    Now fear I this will give it s
tart again;
    Therefore let's follow.
                                                         E
xeunt.

ACT V. Scene I.
Elsinore. A churchyard.

Enter two Clowns, [with spad
es and pickaxes].

  Clown. Is she to be buried in Christian burial when she
wilfully
    seeks 
her own salvation?
  Other. I tell thee she is; therefore make her grave straight.
    The crowner
 hath sate on her, and finds it Christian burial.
  Clown. How can that be, unless she drown'd hers
elf in her own
    defence?
  Other. Why, 'tis found so.
  Clown. It must be se offendendo; it ca
nnot be else. For here
lies
    the point: if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act; and
an

    act hath three branches-it is to act, to do, and to perform;
    argal, she drown'd herself wi
ttingly.
  Other. Nay, but hear you, Goodman Delver!
  Clown. Give me leave. Here lies the water; 
good. Here stands
the
    man; good. If the man go to this water and drown himself, it
is,
    w
ill he nill he, he goes- mark you that. But if the water
come to
    him and drown him, he drowns 
not himself. Argal, he that is
not
    guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.
  Other
. But is this law?
  Clown. Ay, marry, is't- crowner's quest law.
  Other. Will you ha' the truth 
an't? If this had not been a
    gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o' Christian
burial.

  Clown. Why, there thou say'st! And the more pity that great
folk
    should have count'nance i
n this world to drown or hang
themselves
    more than their even-Christian. Come, my spade! There
 is no
    ancient gentlemen but gard'ners, ditchers, and grave-makers.
They
    hold up Adam's p
rofession.
  Other. Was he a gentleman?
  Clown. 'A was the first that ever bore arms.
  Other. W
hy, he had none.
  Clown. What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the
Scripture?
    The Sc
ripture says Adam digg'd. Could he dig without arms?
I'll
    put another question to thee. If tho
u answerest me not to the
    purpose, confess thyself-
  Other. Go to!
  Clown. What is he that 
builds stronger than either the mason,
the
    shipwright, or the carpenter?
  Other. The gallows
-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand
    tenants.
  Clown. I like thy wit well, in good fait
h. The gallows does
well.
    But how does it well? It does well to those that do ill. Now,
    t
hou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the
    church. Argal, the gallows may do we
ll to thee. To't again,
come!
  Other. Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a
    c
arpenter?
  Clown. Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
  Other. Marry, now I can tell!
  Clown. To't.

  Other. Mass, I cannot tell.

                 Enter Hamlet and Horatio afar off.

  Clown. Cud
gel thy brains no more about it, for your dull ass
will
    not mend his pace with beating; and wh
en you are ask'd this
    question next, say 'a grave-maker.' The houses he makes lasts
    till d
oomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan; fetch me a stoup of
    liquor.
                                
            [Exit Second Clown.]


                       [Clown digs and] sings.

       In yo
uth when I did love, did love,
         Methought it was very sweet;
       To contract- O- the ti
me for- a- my behove,
         O, methought there- a- was nothing- a- meet.

  Ham. Has this fell
ow no feeling of his business, that he sings
at
    grave-making?
  Hor. Custom hath made it in h
im a property of easiness.
  Ham. 'Tis e'en so. The hand of little employment hath the
daintier
 
   sense.
  Clown. (sings)
         But age with his stealing steps
           Hath clawed me in 
his clutch,
         And hath shipped me intil the land,
           As if I had never been such.

                                            [Throws up a skull.]

  Ham. That skull had a tongue i
n it, and could sing once. How
the
    knave jowls it to the ground,as if 'twere Cain's jawbone,

that
    did the first murther! This might be the pate of a
Politician,
    which this ass now o'
erreaches; one that would circumvent
God,
    might it not?
  Hor. It might, my lord.
  Ham. Or 
of a courtier, which could say 'Good morrow, sweet
lord!
    How dost thou, good lord?' This might
 be my Lord Such-a-one,
that
    prais'd my Lord Such-a-one's horse when he meant to beg it-
migh
t
    it not?
  Hor. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Why, e'en so! and now my Lady Worm's, chapless, and
kno
ck'd
    about the mazzard with a sexton's spade. Here's fine
revolution,
    and we had the tric
k to see't. Did these bones cost no more
the
    breeding but to play at loggets with 'em? Mine ac
he to think
    on't.
  Clown. (Sings)
         A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,
           For a
nd a shrouding sheet;
         O, a Pit of clay for to be made
           For such a guest is meet
.
                                      Throws up [another skull].

  Ham. There's another. Why m
ay not that be the skull of a
lawyer?
    Where be his quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, his

tenures,
    and his tricks? Why does he suffer this rude knave now to
knock
    him about the s
conce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell
him
    of his action of battery? Hum! This fellow mi
ght be in's time
a
    great buyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizances,
his
    fines,
 his double vouchers, his recoveries. Is this the fine
of
    his fines, and the recovery of his r
ecoveries, to have his
fine
    pate full of fine dirt? Will his vouchers vouch him no more
of
 
   his purchases, and double ones too, than the length and
breadth
    of a pair of indentures? Th
e very conveyances of his lands
will
    scarcely lie in this box; and must th' inheritor himself 
have
no
    more, ha?
  Hor. Not a jot more, my lord.
  Ham. Is not parchment made of sheepskins
?
  Hor. Ay, my lord, And of calveskins too.
  Ham. They are sheep and calves which seek out assur
ance in
that. I
    will speak to this fellow. Whose grave's this, sirrah?
  Clown. Mine, sir.


    [Sings] O, a pit of clay for to be made
              For such a guest is meet.

  Ham. I th
ink it be thine indeed, for thou liest in't.
  Clown. You lie out on't, sir, and therefore 'tis not
 yours.
    For my part, I do not lie in't, yet it is mine.
  Ham. Thou dost lie in't, to be in't 
and say it is thine. 'Tis
for
    the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.
  Clown. 'Ti
s a quick lie, sir; 'twill away again from me to you.
  Ham. What man dost thou dig it for?
  Clow
n. For no man, sir.
  Ham. What woman then?
  Clown. For none neither.
  Ham. Who is to be buried
 in't?
  Clown. One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's
dead.
  Ham. How absolute th
e knave is! We must speak by the card, or
    equivocation will undo us. By the Lord, Horatio, this
 three
years
    I have taken note of it, the age is grown so picked that the
toe
    of the pea
sant comes so near the heel of the courtier he
galls
    his kibe.- How long hast thou been a grav
e-maker?
  Clown. Of all the days i' th' year, I came to't that day that
our
    last king Hamlet
 overcame Fortinbras.
  Ham. How long is that since?
  Clown. Cannot you tell that? Every fool can
 tell that. It was
the
    very day that young Hamlet was born- he that is mad, and sent
    into
 England.
  Ham. Ay, marry, why was be sent into England?
  Clown. Why, because 'a was mad. 'A sha
ll recover his wits
there;
    or, if 'a do not, 'tis no great matter there.
  Ham. Why?
  Clown
. 'Twill not he seen in him there. There the men are as
mad as
    he.
  Ham. How came he mad?
 
 Clown. Very strangely, they say.
  Ham. How strangely?
  Clown. Faith, e'en with losing his wits.

  Ham. Upon what ground?
  Clown. Why, here in Denmark. I have been sexton here, man and
boy
  
  thirty years.
  Ham. How long will a man lie i' th' earth ere he rot?
  Clown. Faith, if 'a be n
ot rotten before 'a die (as we have
many
    pocky corses now-a-days that will scarce hold the lay
ing in,
I
    will last you some eight year or nine year. A tanner will
last
    you nine year.

  Ham. Why he more than another?
  Clown. Why, sir, his hide is so tann'd with his trade that 'a

will
    keep out water a great while; and your water is a sore
decayer of
    your whoreson dead
 body. Here's a skull now. This skull hath
lien
    you i' th' earth three-and-twenty years.
  Ha
m. Whose was it?
  Clown. A whoreson, mad fellow's it was. Whose do you think it
was?
  Ham. Nay,
 I know not.
  Clown. A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! 'A pour'd a flagon
of
    Rhenish on m
y head once. This same skull, sir, was Yorick's
    skull, the King's jester.
  Ham. This?
  Clow
n. E'en that.
  Ham. Let me see. [Takes the skull.] Alas, poor Yorick! I knew
him,
    Horatio. A
 fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy.
He
    hath borne me on his back a thousand tim
es. And now how
abhorred
    in my imagination it is! My gorge rises at it. Here hung
those
    
lips that I have kiss'd I know not how oft. Where be your
gibes
    now? your gambols? your songs?
 your flashes of merriment that
    were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock
you
r
    own grinning? Quite chap- fall'n? Now get you to my lady's
    chamber, and tell her, let he
r paint an inch thick, to this
    favour she must come. Make her laugh at that. Prithee,
Horatio,

    tell me one thing.
  Hor. What's that, my lord?
  Ham. Dost thou think Alexander look'd o' t
his fashion i' th'
earth?
  Hor. E'en so.
  Ham. And smelt so? Pah!
                            
              [Puts down the skull.]
  Hor. E'en so, my lord.
  Ham. To what base uses we may retu
rn, Horatio! Why may not
    imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it
    sto
pping a bunghole?
  Hor. 'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.
  Ham. No, faith, not a
 jot; but to follow him thither with
modesty
    enough, and likelihood to lead it; as thus: Alexa
nder died,
    Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust
is
    earth; of ear
th we make loam; and why of that loam (whereto
he
    was converted) might they not stop a beer ba
rrel?
    Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
    Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.

    O, that that earth which kept the world in awe
    Should patch a wall t' expel the winter's f
law!
    But soft! but soft! aside! Here comes the King-

    Enter [priests with] a coffin [in f
uneral procession], King,
             Queen, Laertes, with Lords attendant.]

    The Queen, the
 courtiers. Who is this they follow?
    And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken
    The cor
se they follow did with desp'rate hand
    Fordo it own life. 'Twas of some estate.
    Couch we a
while, and mark.
                                         [Retires with Horatio.]

  Laer. What c
eremony else?
  Ham. That is Laertes,
    A very noble youth. Mark.
  Laer. What ceremony else?

  Priest. Her obsequies have been as far enlarg'd
    As we have warranty. Her death was doubtful;

    And, but that great command o'ersways the order,
    She should in ground unsanctified have lo
dg'd
    Till the last trumpet. For charitable prayers,
    Shards, flints, and pebbles should be 
thrown on her.
    Yet here she is allow'd her virgin rites,
    Her maiden strewments, and the br
inging home
    Of bell and burial.
  Laer. Must there no more be done?
  Priest. No more be done
.
    We should profane the service of the dead
    To sing a requiem and such rest to her
    As
 to peace-parted souls.
  Laer. Lay her i' th' earth;
    And from her fair and unpolluted flesh

    May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,
    A minist'ring angel shall my sister be
 
   When thou liest howling.
  Ham. What, the fair Ophelia?
  Queen. Sweets to the sweet! Farewell.

                                             [Scatters flowers.]
    I hop'd thou shouldst have b
een my Hamlet's wife;
    I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
    And not have str
ew'd thy grave.
  Laer. O, treble woe
    Fall ten times treble on that cursed head
    Whose wic
ked deed thy most ingenious sense
    Depriv'd thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,
    Till I have
 caught her once more in mine arms.
                                             Leaps in the grave
.
    Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead
    Till of this flat a mountain you have made
 
   T' o'ertop old Pelion or the skyish head
    Of blue Olympus.
  Ham. [comes forward] What is he
 whose grief
    Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow
    Conjures the wand'ring stars, 
and makes them stand
    Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,
    Hamlet the Dane.             
       [Leaps in after Laertes.
  Laer. The devil take thy soul!
                                 
           [Grapples with him].
  Ham. Thou pray'st not well.
    I prithee take thy fingers from 
my throat;
    For, though I am not splenitive and rash,
    Yet have I in me something dangerous,

    Which let thy wisdom fear. Hold off thy hand!
  King. Pluck them asunder.
  Queen. Hamlet, H
amlet!
  All. Gentlemen!
  Hor. Good my lord, be quiet.
             [The Attendants part them, a
nd they come out of the
                                                         grave.]
  Ham. Wh
y, I will fight with him upon this theme
    Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
  Queen. O my so
n, what theme?
  Ham. I lov'd Ophelia. Forty thousand brothers
    Could not (with all their quant
ity of love)
    Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?
  King. O, he is mad, Laertes.
  Quee
n. For love of God, forbear him!
  Ham. 'Swounds, show me what thou't do.
    Woo't weep? woo't fi
ght? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?
    Woo't drink up esill? eat a crocodile?
    I'll do't. Dos
t thou come here to whine?
    To outface me with leaping in her grave?
    Be buried quick with h
er, and so will I.
    And if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
    Millions of acres on us,
 till our ground,
    Singeing his pate against the burning zone,
    Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, 
an thou'lt mouth,
    I'll rant as well as thou.
  Queen. This is mere madness;
    And thus a wh
ile the fit will work on him.
    Anon, as patient as the female dove
    When that her golden cou
plets are disclos'd,
    His silence will sit drooping.
  Ham. Hear you, sir!
    What is the rea
son that you use me thus?
    I lov'd you ever. But it is no matter.
    Let Hercules himself do w
hat he may,
    The cat will mew, and dog will have his day.
Exit.
  King. I pray thee, good Hora
tio, wait upon him.
                                                   Exit Horatio.
    [To Laert
es] Strengthen your patience in our last night's
speech.
    We'll put the matter to the present p
ush.-
    Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.-
    This grave shall have a living monumen
t.
    An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
    Till then in patience our proceeding be.
      
                                                   Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A hall in t
he Castle.

Enter Hamlet and Horatio.

  Ham. So much for this, sir; now shall you see the other
.
    You do remember all the circumstance?
  Hor. Remember it, my lord!
  Ham. Sir, in my heart 
there was a kind of fighting
    That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay
    Worse than the m
utinies in the bilboes. Rashly-
    And prais'd be rashness for it; let us know,
    Our indiscret
ion sometime serves us well
    When our deep plots do pall; and that should learn us
    There's 
a divinity that shapes our ends,
    Rough-hew them how we will-
  Hor. That is most certain.
  H
am. Up from my cabin,
    My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
    Grop'd I to find out them;
 had my desire,
    Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew
    To mine own room again; making
 so bold
    (My fears forgetting manners) to unseal
    Their grand commission; where I found, Ho
ratio
    (O royal knavery!), an exact command,
    Larded with many several sorts of reasons,
  
  Importing Denmark's health, and England's too,
    With, hoo! such bugs and goblins in my life-

    That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
    No, not to stay the finding of the axe,
    My h
ead should be struck off.
  Hor. Is't possible?
  Ham. Here's the commission; read it at more leis
ure.
    But wilt thou bear me how I did proceed?
  Hor. I beseech you.
  Ham. Being thus benette
d round with villanies,
    Or I could make a prologue to my brains,
    They had begun the play. 
I sat me down;
    Devis'd a new commission; wrote it fair.
    I once did hold it, as our statist
s do,
    A baseness to write fair, and labour'd much
    How to forget that learning; but, sir, n
ow
    It did me yeoman's service. Wilt thou know
    Th' effect of what I wrote?
  Hor. Ay, good
 my lord.
  Ham. An earnest conjuration from the King,
    As England was his faithful tributary,

    As love between them like the palm might flourish,
    As peace should still her wheaten garla
nd wear
    And stand a comma 'tween their amities,
    And many such-like as's of great charge,

    That, on the view and knowing of these contents,
    Without debatement further, more or less,

    He should the bearers put to sudden death,
    Not shriving time allow'd.
  Hor. How was this
 seal'd?
  Ham. Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
    I had my father's signet in my purse,

    Which was the model of that Danish seal;
    Folded the writ up in the form of th' other,
    
Subscrib'd it, gave't th' impression, plac'd it safely,
    The changeling never known. Now, the ne
xt day
    Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent
    Thou know'st already.
  Hor. So Gu
ildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.
  Ham. Why, man, they did make love to this employment!
    Th
ey are not near my conscience; their defeat
    Does by their own insinuation grow.
    'Tis dange
rous when the baser nature comes
    Between the pass and fell incensed points
    Of mighty oppos
ites.
  Hor. Why, what a king is this!
  Ham. Does it not, thinks't thee, stand me now upon-
    
He that hath kill'd my king, and whor'd my mother;
    Popp'd in between th' election and my hopes;

    Thrown out his angle for my proper life,
    And with such coz'nage- is't not perfect conscie
nce
    To quit him with this arm? And is't not to be damn'd
    To let this canker of our nature 
come
    In further evil?
  Hor. It must be shortly known to him from England
    What is the iss
ue of the business there.
  Ham. It will be short; the interim is mine,
    And a man's life is no
 more than to say 'one.'
    But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
    That to Laertes I forgot mysel
f,
    For by the image of my cause I see
    The portraiture of his. I'll court his favours.
   
 But sure the bravery of his grief did put me
    Into a tow'ring passion.
  Hor. Peace! Who comes
 here?

                 Enter young Osric, a courtier.

  Osr. Your lordship is right welcome b
ack to Denmark.
  Ham. I humbly thank you, sir. [Aside to Horatio] Dost know this
    waterfly?
 
 Hor. [aside to Hamlet] No, my good lord.
  Ham. [aside to Horatio] Thy state is the more gracious;
 for
'tis a
    vice to know him. He hath much land, and fertile. Let a beast
be
    lord of bea
sts, and his crib shall stand at the king's mess.
'Tis
    a chough; but, as I say, spacious in th
e possession of dirt.

  Osr. Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should
impart
    
a thing to you from his Majesty.
  Ham. I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit. Put

your
    bonnet to his right use. 'Tis for the head.
  Osr. I thank your lordship, it is very hot.

  Ham. No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly.
  Osr. It is indifferent cold, my l
ord, indeed.
  Ham. But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my
complexion.
  Osr. Exceedin
gly, my lord; it is very sultry, as 'twere- I
cannot
    tell how. But, my lord, his Majesty bade 
me signify to you
that
    he has laid a great wager on your head. Sir, this is the
matter-
  Ha
m. I beseech you remember.
                           [Hamlet moves him to put on his hat.]
  Osr.
 Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here
is
    newly come to court Laertes; be
lieve me, an absolute
gentleman,
    full of most excellent differences, of very soft society and

    great showing. Indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the
card
    or calendar of gentry; f
or you shall find in him the
continent of
    what part a gentleman would see.
  Ham. Sir, his de
finement suffers no perdition in you; though, I

    know, to divide him inventorially would dozy 
th' arithmetic
of
    memory, and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail.
    But, in t
he verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of
great
    article, and his infusion of such dea
rth and rareness as, to
make
    true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror, and who
else

    would trace him, his umbrage, nothing more.
  Osr. Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.

  Ham. The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our
more
    rawer breath?
  Osr. 
Sir?
  Hor [aside to Hamlet] Is't not possible to understand in
another
    tongue? You will do't
, sir, really.
  Ham. What imports the nomination of this gentleman?
  Osr. Of Laertes?
  Hor. [a
side] His purse is empty already. All's golden words are
    spent.
  Ham. Of him, sir.
  Osr. I 
know you are not ignorant-
  Ham. I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would
not
 
   much approve me. Well, sir?
  Osr. You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is-
  Ham. I
 dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in
    excellence; but to know a man well we
re to know himself.
  Osr. I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on
him
    by 
them, in his meed he's unfellowed.
  Ham. What's his weapon?
  Osr. Rapier and dagger.
  Ham. Tha
t's two of his weapons- but well.
  Osr. The King, sir, hath wager'd with him six Barbary horses;

    against the which he has impon'd, as I take it, six French
    rapiers and poniards, with their
 assigns, as girdle, hangers,
and
    so. Three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy
,
    very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of
    very liberal conceit.
  H
am. What call you the carriages?
  Hor. [aside to Hamlet] I knew you must be edified by the
margen
t
    ere you had done.
  Osr. The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
  Ham. The phrase would be mo
re germane to the matter if we could
    carry cannon by our sides. I would it might be hangers til
l
then.
    But on! Six Barbary horses against six French swords, their
    assigns, and three li
beral-conceited carriages: that's the
French
    bet against the Danish. Why is this all impon'd, 
as you call
it?
  Osr. The King, sir, hath laid that, in a dozen passes between
    yourself and 
him, he shall not exceed you three hits; he hath
    laid on twelve for nine, and it would come to 
immediate trial
    if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.
  Ham. How if I answer no?
  Osr
. I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
  Ham. Sir, I will walk here in the hall
. If it please his
Majesty,
    it is the breathing time of day with me. Let the foils be
    bro
ught, the gentleman willing, and the King hold his
purpose,
    I will win for him if I can; if no
t, I will gain nothing but
my
    shame and the odd hits.
  Osr. Shall I redeliver you e'en so?

  Ham. To this effect, sir, after what flourish your nature will.
  Osr. I commend my duty to your 
lordship.
  Ham. Yours, yours. [Exit Osric.] He does well to commend it
    himself; there are no 
tongues else for's turn.
  Hor. This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.
  Ham. He did c
omply with his dug before he suck'd it. Thus has
he,
    and many more of the same bevy that I kno
w the drossy age
dotes
    on, only got the tune of the time and outward habit of
encounter-
   
 a kind of yesty collection, which carries them through and
    through the most fann'd and winnowe
d opinions; and do but
blow
    them to their trial-the bubbles are out,

                      
      Enter a Lord.

  Lord. My lord, his Majesty commended him to you by young Osric,
who
    b
rings back to him, that you attend him in the hall. He sends
to
    know if your pleasure hold to 
play with Laertes, or that you
will
    take longer time.
  Ham. I am constant to my purposes; th
ey follow the King's
pleasure.
    If his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or whensoever,
provi
ded
    I be so able as now.
  Lord. The King and Queen and all are coming down.
  Ham. In happy 
time.
  Lord. The Queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to
    Laertes before you fal
l to play.
  Ham. She well instructs me.
                                                    [Exit
 Lord.]
  Hor. You will lose this wager, my lord.
  Ham. I do not think so. Since he went into Fra
nce I have been
in
    continual practice. I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst
not
    thi
nk how ill all's here about my heart. But it is no matter.
  Hor. Nay, good my lord -
  Ham. It is
 but foolery; but it is such a kind of gaingiving as
    would perhaps trouble a woman.
  Hor. If 
your mind dislike anything, obey it. I will forestall
their
    repair hither and say you are not 
fit.
  Ham. Not a whit, we defy augury; there's a special providence
in
    the fall of a sparrow
. If it be now, 'tis not to come; if it
be
    not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet 
it will
come:
    the readiness is all. Since no man knows aught of what he
leaves,
    what is'
t to leave betimes? Let be.

    Enter King, Queen, Laertes, Osric, and Lords, with other
       
       Attendants with foils and gauntlets.
               A table and flagons of wine on it.

  
King. Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
                    [The King puts Laertes' h
and into Hamlet's.]
  Ham. Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong;
    But pardon't, as y
ou are a gentleman.
    This presence knows,
    And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd

    With sore distraction. What I have done
    That might your nature, honour, and exception
   
 Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
    Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet.
    I
f Hamlet from himself be taken away,
    And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
    Then Ha
mlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
    Who does it, then? His madness. If't be so,
    Hamlet is 
of the faction that is wrong'd;
    His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
    Sir, in this audience,

    Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd evil
    Free me so far in your most generous thoughts
  
  That I have shot my arrow o'er the house
    And hurt my brother.
  Laer. I am satisfied in natu
re,
    Whose motive in this case should stir me most
    To my revenge. But in my terms of honour

    I stand aloof, and will no reconcilement
    Till by some elder masters of known honour
    
I have a voice and precedent of peace
    To keep my name ungor'd. But till that time
    I do rec
eive your offer'd love like love,
    And will not wrong it.
  Ham. I embrace it freely,
    And 
will this brother's wager frankly play.
    Give us the foils. Come on.
  Laer. Come, one for me.

  Ham. I'll be your foil, Laertes. In mine ignorance
    Your skill shall, like a star i' th' dark
est night,
    Stick fiery off indeed.
  Laer. You mock me, sir.
  Ham. No, by this hand.
  King
. Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
    You know the wager?
  Ham. Very well, my lo
rd.
    Your Grace has laid the odds o' th' weaker side.
  King. I do not fear it, I have seen you
 both;
    But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.
  Laer. This is too heavy; let me see
 another.
  Ham. This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
                              
                  Prepare to play.
  Osr. Ay, my good lord.
  King. Set me the stoups of wine upon
 that table.
    If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
    Or quit in answer of the third exchan
ge,
    Let all the battlements their ordnance fire;
    The King shall drink to Hamlet's better b
reath,
    And in the cup an union shall he throw
    Richer than that which four successive kings

    In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;
    And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,

    The trumpet to the cannoneer without,
    The cannons to the heavens, the heaven to earth,
  
  'Now the King drinks to Hamlet.' Come, begin.
    And you the judges, bear a wary eye.
  Ham. Co
me on, sir.
  Laer. Come, my lord.                                They play.
  Ham. One.
  Laer. 
No.
  Ham. Judgment!
  Osr. A hit, a very palpable hit.
  Laer. Well, again!
  King. Stay, give 
me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
    Here's to thy health.
               [Drum; trumpets so
und; a piece goes off [within].
    Give him the cup.
  Ham. I'll play this bout first; set it by 
awhile.
    Come. (They play.) Another hit. What say you?
  Laer. A touch, a touch; I do confess't
.
  King. Our son shall win.
  Queen. He's fat, and scant of breath.
    Here, Hamlet, take my na
pkin, rub thy brows.
    The Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
  Ham. Good madam!
  King. Ge
rtrude, do not drink.
  Queen. I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.          Drinks.
  King. [as
ide] It is the poison'd cup; it is too late.
  Ham. I dare not drink yet, madam; by-and-by.
  Quee
n. Come, let me wipe thy face.
  Laer. My lord, I'll hit him now.
  King. I do not think't.
  Lae
r. [aside] And yet it is almost against my conscience.
  Ham. Come for the third, Laertes! You but 
dally.
    Pray you pass with your best violence;
    I am afeard you make a wanton of me.
  Laer
. Say you so? Come on.                               Play.
  Osr. Nothing neither way.
  Laer. Hav
e at you now!
                [Laertes wounds Hamlet; then] in scuffling, they
                   
 change rapiers, [and Hamlet wounds Laertes].
  King. Part them! They are incens'd.
  Ham. Nay com
e! again!                         The Queen falls.

  Osr. Look to the Queen there, ho!
  Hor. Th
ey bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?
  Osr. How is't, Laertes?
  Laer. Why, as a woodcock t
o mine own springe, Osric.
    I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.
  Ham. How does the Que
en?
  King. She sounds to see them bleed.
  Queen. No, no! the drink, the drink! O my dear Hamlet!

    The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.                 [Dies.]
  Ham. O villany! Ho! let the do
or be lock'd.
    Treachery! Seek it out.
                                                [Laertes
 falls.]
  Laer. It is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain;
    No medicine in the world can do t
hee good.
    In thee there is not half an hour of life.
    The treacherous instrument is in thy 
hand,
    Unbated and envenom'd. The foul practice
    Hath turn'd itself on me. Lo, here I lie,

    Never to rise again. Thy mother's poison'd.
    I can no more. The King, the King's to blame.

  Ham. The point envenom'd too?
    Then, venom, to thy work.                    Hurts the King.
 
 All. Treason! treason!
  King. O, yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt.
  Ham. Here, thou incest
uous, murd'rous, damned Dane,
    Drink off this potion! Is thy union here?
    Follow my mother. 
                                King dies.
  Laer. He is justly serv'd.
    It is a poison temper'
d by himself.
    Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet.
    Mine and my father's death come 
not upon thee,
    Nor thine on me!                                       Dies.
  Ham. Heaven make
 thee free of it! I follow thee.
    I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!
    You that look 
pale and tremble at this chance,
    That are but mutes or audience to this act,
    Had I but tim
e (as this fell sergeant, Death,
    Is strict in his arrest) O, I could tell you-
    But let it 
be. Horatio, I am dead;
    Thou liv'st; report me and my cause aright
    To the unsatisfied.
  
Hor. Never believe it.
    I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.
    Here's yet some liquor left
.
  Ham. As th'art a man,
    Give me the cup. Let go! By heaven, I'll ha't.
    O good Horatio, 
what a wounded name
    (Things standing thus unknown) shall live behind me!
    If thou didst eve
r hold me in thy heart,
    Absent thee from felicity awhile,
    And in this harsh world draw thy
 breath in pain,
    To tell my story.         [March afar off, and shot within.]
    What warlike
 noise is this?
  Osr. Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
    To the ambassadors of
 England gives
    This warlike volley.
  Ham. O, I die, Horatio!
    The potent poison quite o'e
rcrows my spirit.
    I cannot live to hear the news from England,
    But I do prophesy th' elect
ion lights
    On Fortinbras. He has my dying voice.
    So tell him, with th' occurrents, more an
d less,
    Which have solicited- the rest is silence.             Dies.
  Hor. Now cracks a noble
 heart. Good night, sweet prince,
    And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
               
                                  [March within.]
    Why does the drum come hither?

    Enter F
ortinbras and English Ambassadors, with Drum,
                  Colours, and Attendants.

  Fort.
 Where is this sight?
  Hor. What is it you will see?
    If aught of woe or wonder, cease your se
arch.
  Fort. This quarry cries on havoc. O proud Death,
    What feast is toward in thine eternal
 cell
    That thou so many princes at a shot
    So bloodily hast struck.
  Ambassador. The sigh
t is dismal;
    And our affairs from England come too late.
    The ears are senseless that shoul
d give us hearing
    To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd
    That Rosencrantz and Guildenste
rn are dead.
    Where should we have our thanks?
  Hor. Not from his mouth,
    Had it th' abili
ty of life to thank you.
    He never gave commandment for their death.
    But since, so jump upo
n this bloody question,
    You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
    Are here arriv'd, 
give order that these bodies
    High on a stage be placed to the view;
    And let me speak to th
e yet unknowing world
    How these things came about. So shall you hear
    Of carnal, bloody and
 unnatural acts;
    Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters;
    Of deaths put on by cunning a
nd forc'd cause;
    And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
    Fall'n on th' inventors' heads. All
 this can I
    Truly deliver.
  Fort. Let us haste to hear it,
    And call the noblest to the a
udience.
    For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.
    I have some rights of memory in this ki
ngdom
    Which now, to claim my vantage doth invite me.
  Hor. Of that I shall have also cause to
 speak,
    And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more.
    But let this same be presently p
erform'd,
    Even while men's minds are wild, lest more mischance
    On plots and errors happen.

  Fort. Let four captains
    Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage;
    For he was likely, ha
d he been put on,
    To have prov'd most royally; and for his passage
    The soldiers' music and
 the rites of war
    Speak loudly for him.
    Take up the bodies. Such a sight as this
    Beco
mes the field but here shows much amiss.
    Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
            Exeunt marchi
ng; after the which a peal of ordnance
                                                   are shot 
off.

ACT I. Scene I.
Elsinore. A platform 
before the Castle.

Enter two Sentinels-[first,] Francisco, [who paces up and down
at his post; t
hen] Bernardo, [who approaches him].

  Ber. Who's there?
  Fran. Nay, answer me. Stand and unfol
d yourself.
  Ber. Long live the King!
  Fran. Bernardo?
  Ber. He.
  Fran. You come most carefu
lly upon your hour.
  Ber. 'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.
  Fran. For this re
lief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold,
    And I am sick at heart.
  Ber. Have you had quiet guard?

  Fran. Not a mouse stirring.
  Ber. Well, good night.
    If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,

    The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.

                    Enter Horatio and Marcellus.


  Fran. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?
  Hor. Friends to this ground.
  Mar. An
d liegemen to the Dane.
  Fran. Give you good night.
  Mar. O, farewell, honest soldier.
    Who 
hath reliev'd you?
  Fran. Bernardo hath my place.
    Give you good night.                       
            Exit.
  Mar. Holla, Bernardo!
  Ber. Say-
    What, is Horatio there ?
  Hor. A piec
e of him.
  Ber. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.
  Mar. What, has this thing appear'd a
gain to-night?
  Ber. I have seen nothing.
  Mar. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
    And will
 not let belief take hold of him
    Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.
    Therefore 
I have entreated him along,
    With us to watch the minutes of this night,
    That, if again thi
s apparition come,
    He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
  Hor. Tush, tush, 'twill not appe
ar.
  Ber. Sit down awhile,
    And let us once again assail your ears,
    That are so fortified
 against our story,
    What we two nights have seen.
  Hor. Well, sit we down,
    And let us he
ar Bernardo speak of this.
  Ber. Last night of all,
    When yond same star that's westward from 
the pole
    Had made his course t' illume that part of heaven
    Where now it burns, Marcellus a
nd myself,
    The bell then beating one-

                        Enter Ghost.

  Mar. Peace! 
break thee off! Look where it comes again!
  Ber. In the same figure, like the King that's dead.
 
 Mar. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
  Ber. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio
.
  Hor. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.
  Ber. It would be spoke to.
  Mar. Quest
ion it, Horatio.
  Hor. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night
    Together with that fair
 and warlike form
    In which the majesty of buried Denmark
    Did sometimes march? By heaven I 
charge thee speak!
  Mar. It is offended.
  Ber. See, it stalks away!
  Hor. Stay! Speak, speak! 
I charge thee speak!
                                                     Exit Ghost.
  Mar. 'Tis 
gone and will not answer.
  Ber. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale.
    Is not this some
thing more than fantasy?
    What think you on't?
  Hor. Before my God, I might not this believe

    Without the sensible and true avouch
    Of mine own eyes.
  Mar. Is it not like the King?
  
Hor. As thou art to thyself.
    Such was the very armour he had on
    When he th' ambitious Norw
ay combated.
    So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,
    He smote the sledded Polacks on t
he ice.
    'Tis strange.
  Mar. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
    With martial 
stalk hath he gone by our watch.
  Hor. In what particular thought to work I know not;
    But, in
 the gross and scope of my opinion,
    This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
  Mar. Good
 now, sit down, and tell me he that knows,
    Why this same strict and most observant watch
    S
o nightly toils the subject of the land,
    And why such daily cast of brazen cannon
    And fore
ign mart for implements of war;
    Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
    Does not 
divide the Sunday from the week.
    What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
    Doth make th
e night joint-labourer with the day?
    Who is't that can inform me?
  Hor. That can I.
    At l
east, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
    Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
    Was, as
 you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
    Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
    Dar'd to t
he combat; in which our valiant Hamlet
    (For so this side of our known world esteem'd him)
    
Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,
    Well ratified by law and heraldry,
    Did
 forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
    Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror;
    A
gainst the which a moiety competent
    Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
    To the inher
itance of Fortinbras,
    Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant
    And carriage of the
 article design'd,
    His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
    Of unimproved mettle ho
t and full,
    Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,
    Shark'd up a list of lawless res
olutes,
    For food and diet, to some enterprise
    That hath a stomach in't; which is no other,

    As it doth well appear unto our state,
    But to recover of us, by strong hand
    And term
s compulsatory, those foresaid lands
    So by his father lost; and this, I take it,
    Is the ma
in motive of our preparations,
    The source of this our watch, and the chief head
    Of this po
st-haste and romage in the land.
  Ber. I think it be no other but e'en so.
    Well may it sort t
hat this portentous figure
    Comes armed through our watch, so like the King
    That was and is
 the question of these wars.
  Hor. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
    In the most high a
nd palmy state of Rome,
    A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
    The graves stood tenantles
s, and the sheeted dead
    Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;
    As stars with trains o
f fire, and dews of blood,
    Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
    Upon whose influence N
eptune's empire stands
    Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.
    And even the like precurs
e of fierce events,
    As harbingers preceding still the fates
    And prologue to the omen comin
g on,
    Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
    Unto our climature and countrymen.

  
                    Enter Ghost again.

    But soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again!
    I'll 
cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!
                                               Spread
s his arms.
    If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
    Speak to me.
    If there be any goo
d thing to be done,
    That may to thee do ease, and, race to me,
    Speak to me.
    If thou a
rt privy to thy country's fate,
    Which happily foreknowing may avoid,
    O, speak!
    Or if 
thou hast uphoarded in thy life
    Extorted treasure in the womb of earth
    (For which, they sa
y, you spirits oft walk in death),
                                                 The cock crows.

    Speak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!
  Mar. Shall I strike at it with my partis
an?
  Hor. Do, if it will not stand.
  Ber. 'Tis here!
  Hor. 'Tis here!
  Mar. 'Tis gone!
    
                                                 Exit Ghost.
    We do it wrong, being so majestica
l,
    To offer it the show of violence;
    For it is as the air, invulnerable,
    And our vain
 blows malicious mockery.
  Ber. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
  Hor. And then it sta
rted, like a guilty thing
    Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
    The cock, that is the trump
et to the morn,
    Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
    Awake the god of day; and a
t his warning,
    Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
    Th' extravagant and erring spirit 
hies
    To his confine; and of the truth herein
    This present object made probation.
  Mar. I
t faded on the crowing of the cock.
    Some say that ever, 'gainst that season comes
    Wherein 
our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
    The bird of dawning singeth all night long;
    And then, t
hey say, no spirit dare stir abroad,
    The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,
    No 
fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
    So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
  Hor. So
 have I heard and do in part believe it.
    But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
    Walks 
o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.
    Break we our watch up; and by my advice
    Let us imp
art what we have seen to-night
    Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
    This spirit, dumb to 
us, will speak to him.
    Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
    As needful in our lov
es, fitting our duty?
    Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
    Where we shall find him 
most conveniently.           Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A room of state in the Castle.


Flourish. [Enter Claudius, King of Denmark, Gertrude the Queen,
Hamlet,
Polonius, Laertes and his
 sister Ophelia, [Voltemand, Cornelius,]
Lords Attendant.

  King. Though yet of Hamlet our dear 
brother's death
    The memory be green, and that it us befitted
    To bear our hearts in grief, 
and our whole kingdom
    To be contracted in one brow of woe,
    Yet so far hath discretion foug
ht with nature
    That we with wisest sorrow think on him
    Together with remembrance of oursel
ves.
    Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
    Th' imperial jointress to this warlike 
state,
    Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,
    With an auspicious, and a dropping eye,
  
  With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,
    In equal scale weighing delight and dole,

    Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd
    Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
    
With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
    Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
   
 Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
    Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
    Our st
ate to be disjoint and out of frame,
    Colleagued with this dream of his advantage,
    He hath 
not fail'd to pester us with message
    Importing the surrender of those lands
    Lost by his fa
ther, with all bands of law,
    To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
    Now for ourself
 and for this time of meeting.
    Thus much the business is: we have here writ
    To Norway, unc
le of young Fortinbras,
    Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears
    Of this his nephew's purp
ose, to suppress
    His further gait herein, in that the levies,
    The lists, and full proporti
ons are all made
    Out of his subject; and we here dispatch
    You, good Cornelius, and you, Vo
ltemand,
    For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,
    Giving to you no further personal pow
er
    To business with the King, more than the scope
    Of these dilated articles allow.        
    [Gives a paper.]
    Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
  Cor., Volt. In that, an
d all things, will we show our duty.
  King. We doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell.
             
                    Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius.
    And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?

    You told us of some suit. What is't, Laertes?
    You cannot speak of reason to the Dane
   
 And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
    That shall not be my offer, not thy askin
g?
    The head is not more native to the heart,
    The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
   
 Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
    What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
  Laer. My drea
d lord,
    Your leave and favour to return to France;
    From whence though willingly I came to 
Denmark
    To show my duty in your coronation,
    Yet now I must confess, that duty done,
    M
y thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
    And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.

  King. Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
  Pol. He hath, my lord, wrung from me m
y slow leave
    By laboursome petition, and at last
    Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent.

    I do beseech you give him leave to go.
  King. Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,
   
 And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
    But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son-
  Ham. [asid
e] A little more than kin, and less than kind!
  King. How is it that the clouds still hang on you?

  Ham. Not so, my lord. I am too much i' th' sun.
  Queen. Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour o
ff,
    And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
    Do not for ever with thy vailed lids

    Seek for thy noble father in the dust.
    Thou know'st 'tis common. All that lives must die,

    Passing through nature to eternity.
  Ham. Ay, madam, it is common.
  Queen. If it be,
    W
hy seems it so particular with thee?
  Ham. Seems, madam, Nay, it is. I know not 'seems.'
    'Tis
 not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
    Nor customary suits of solemn black,
    Nor windy susp
iration of forc'd breath,
    No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
    Nor the dejected havior o
f the visage,
    Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
    'That can denote me truly. 
These indeed seem,
    For they are actions that a man might play;
    But I have that within whic
h passeth show-
    These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
  King. 'Tis sweet and commendab
le in your nature, Hamlet,
    To give these mourning duties to your father;
    But you must know
, your father lost a father;
    That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
    In filial 
obligation for some term
    To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever
    In obstinate condolement
 is a course
    Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief;
    It shows a will most incorrect t
o heaven,
    A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
    An understanding simple and unschool'd;

    For what we know must be, and is as common
    As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
    Why 
should we in our peevish opposition
    Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
    A fault
 against the dead, a fault to nature,
    To reason most absurd, whose common theme
    Is death o
f fathers, and who still hath cried,
    From the first corse till he that died to-day,
    'This 
must be so.' We pray you throw to earth
    This unprevailing woe, and think of us
    As of a fat
her; for let the world take note
    You are the most immediate to our throne,
    And with no les
s nobility of love
    Than that which dearest father bears his son
    Do I impart toward you. Fo
r your intent
    In going back to school in Wittenberg,
    It is most retrograde to our desire;

    And we beseech you, bend you to remain
    Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
    Our 
chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
  Queen. Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.
    
I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.
  Ham. I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
  K
ing. Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.
    Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come.
    This gent
le and unforc'd accord of Hamlet
    Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,
    No jocund hea
lth that Denmark drinks to-day
    But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
    And the King
's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,
    Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.
                
                Flourish. Exeunt all but Hamlet.
  Ham. O that this too too solid flesh would melt,

    Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!
    Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
    His canon
 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
    How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
    Seem to me a
ll the uses of this world!
    Fie on't! ah, fie! 'Tis an unweeded garden
    That grows to seed; 
things rank and gross in nature
    Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
    But two mo
nths dead! Nay, not so much, not two.
    So excellent a king, that was to this
    Hyperion to a 
satyr; so loving to my mother
    That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
    Visit her face 
too roughly. Heaven and earth!
    Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him
    As if increase 
of appetite had grown
    By what it fed on; and yet, within a month-
    Let me not think on't! F
railty, thy name is woman!-
    A little month, or ere those shoes were old
    With which she fol
lowed my poor father's body
    Like Niobe, all tears- why she, even she
    (O God! a beast that 
wants discourse of reason
    Would have mourn'd longer) married with my uncle;
    My father's br
other, but no more like my father
    Than I to Hercules. Within a month,
    Ere yet the salt of 
most unrighteous tears
    Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
    She married. O, most wick
ed speed, to post
    With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
    It is not, nor it cannot come 
to good.
    But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue!

          Enter Horatio, Marcellus, 
and Bernardo.

  Hor. Hail to your lordship!
  Ham. I am glad to see you well.
    Horatio!- or 
I do forget myself.
  Hor. The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
  Ham. Sir, my good frie
nd- I'll change that name with you.
    And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?
    Marcellus?

  Mar. My good lord!
  Ham. I am very glad to see you.- [To Bernardo] Good even, sir.-

    But
 what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
  Hor. A truant disposition, good my lord.
  Ham. I wou
ld not hear your enemy say so,
    Nor shall you do my ear that violence
    To make it truster of
 your own report
    Against yourself. I know you are no truant.
    But what is your affair in El
sinore?
    We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
  Hor. My lord, I came to see your fathe
r's funeral.
  Ham. I prithee do not mock me, fellow student.
    I think it was to see my mother'
s wedding.
  Hor. Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.
  Ham. Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The fune
ral bak'd meats
    Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
    Would I had met my dearest f
oe in heaven
    Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
    My father- methinks I see my father.
 
 Hor. O, where, my lord?
  Ham. In my mind's eye, Horatio.
  Hor. I saw him once. He was a goodly 
king.
  Ham. He was a man, take him for all in all.
    I shall not look upon his like again.
  H
or. My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
  Ham. Saw? who?
  Hor. My lord, the King your father.

  Ham. The King my father?
  Hor. Season your admiration for a while
    With an attent ear, til
l I may deliver
    Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
    This marvel to you.
  Ham. For God's
 love let me hear!
  Hor. Two nights together had these gentlemen
    (Marcellus and Bernardo) on 
their watch
    In the dead vast and middle of the night
    Been thus encount'red. A figure like 
your father,
    Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
    Appears before them and with solemn march

    Goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walk'd
    By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,

    Within his truncheon's length; whilst they distill'd
    Almost to jelly with the act of fear
,
    Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
    In dreadful secrecy impart they did,
    An
d I with them the third night kept the watch;
    Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
    
Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
    The apparition comes. I knew your father.
   
 These hands are not more like.
  Ham. But where was this?
  Mar. My lord, upon the platform where
 we watch'd.
  Ham. Did you not speak to it?
  Hor. My lord, I did;
    But answer made it none. 
Yet once methought
    It lifted up it head and did address
    Itself to motion, like as it would
 speak;
    But even then the morning cock crew loud,
    And at the sound it shrunk in haste away

    And vanish'd from our sight.
  Ham. 'Tis very strange.
  Hor. As I do live, my honour'd lord
, 'tis true;
    And we did think it writ down in our duty
    To let you know of it.
  Ham. Inde
ed, indeed, sirs. But this troubles me.
    Hold you the watch to-night?
  Both [Mar. and Ber.] We
 do, my lord.
  Ham. Arm'd, say you?
  Both. Arm'd, my lord.
  Ham. From top to toe?
  Both. My 
lord, from head to foot.
  Ham. Then saw you not his face?
  Hor. O, yes, my lord! He wore his bea
ver up.
  Ham. What, look'd he frowningly.
  Hor. A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
  H
am. Pale or red?
  Hor. Nay, very pale.
  Ham. And fix'd his eyes upon you?
  Hor. Most constantl
y.
  Ham. I would I had been there.
  Hor. It would have much amaz'd you.
  Ham. Very like, very 
like. Stay'd it long?
  Hor. While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
  Both. Longer, l
onger.
  Hor. Not when I saw't.
  Ham. His beard was grizzled- no?
  Hor. It was, as I have seen 
it in his life,
    A sable silver'd.
  Ham. I will watch to-night.
    Perchance 'twill walk aga
in.
  Hor. I warr'nt it will.
  Ham. If it assume my noble father's person,
    I'll speak to it,
 though hell itself should gape
    And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
    If you have hith
erto conceal'd this sight,
    Let it be tenable in your silence still;
    And whatsoever else sh
all hap to-night,
    Give it an understanding but no tongue.
    I will requite your loves. So, f
are you well.
    Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
    I'll visit you.
  All. Our dut
y to your honour.
  Ham. Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell.
                                   
     Exeunt [all but Hamlet].
    My father's spirit- in arms? All is not well.
    I doubt some f
oul play. Would the night were come!
    Till then sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,
    T
hough all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
Exit.




Scene III.
Elsinore. A room in t
he house of Polonius.

Enter Laertes and Ophelia.

  Laer. My necessaries are embark'd. Farewell
.
    And, sister, as the winds give benefit
    And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
    But l
et me hear from you.
  Oph. Do you doubt that?
  Laer. For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,

    Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood;
    A violet in the youth of primy nature,
    Forwar
d, not permanent- sweet, not lasting;
    The perfume and suppliance of a minute;
    No more.
  
Oph. No more but so?
  Laer. Think it no more.
    For nature crescent does not grow alone
    In
 thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,
    The inward service of the mind and soul
    Grows w
ide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
    And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
    The virtue 
of his will; but you must fear,
    His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
    For he him
self is subject to his birth.
    He may not, as unvalued persons do,
    Carve for himself, for o
n his choice depends
    The safety and health of this whole state,
    And therefore must his cho
ice be circumscrib'd
    Unto the voice and yielding of that body
    Whereof he is the head. Then
 if he says he loves you,
    It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
    As he in his particular
 act and place
    May give his saying deed; which is no further
    Than the main voice of Denmar
k goes withal.
    Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain
    If with too credent ear you li
st his songs,
    Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
    To his unmast'red importuni
ty.
    Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
    And keep you in the rear of your affection,

    Out of the shot and danger of desire.
    The chariest maid is prodigal enough
    If she un
mask her beauty to the moon.
    Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes.
    The canker galls
 the infants of the spring
    Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd,
    And in the morn and 
liquid dew of youth
    Contagious blastments are most imminent.
    Be wary then; best safety lie
s in fear.
    Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
  Oph. I shall th' effect of this go
od lesson keep
    As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
    Do not as some ungracious pa
stors do,
    Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven,
    Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless l
ibertine,
    Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads
    And recks not his own rede.
  Lae
r. O, fear me not!

                       Enter Polonius.

    I stay too long. But here my fat
her comes.
    A double blessing is a double grace;
    Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
  Po
l. Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame!
    The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
 
   And you are stay'd for. There- my blessing with thee!
    And these few precepts in thy memory

    Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
    Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.

    Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar:
    Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried
,
    Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel;
    But do not dull thy palm with entertainm
ent
    Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware
    Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,

    Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee.
    Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice;

    Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
    Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,

    But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
    For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
    A
nd they in France of the best rank and station
    Are most select and generous, chief in that.
  
  Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
    For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
    And borro
wing dulls the edge of husbandry.
    This above all- to thine own self be true,
    And it must f
ollow, as the night the day,
    Thou canst not then be false to any man.
    Farewell. My blessin
g season this in thee!
  Laer. Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
  Pol. The time invites yo
u. Go, your servants tend.
  Laer. Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well
    What I have said to yo
u.
  Oph. 'Tis in my memory lock'd,
    And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
  Laer. Farewe
ll.                                          Exit.
  Pol. What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?

  Oph. So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
  Pol. Marry, well bethought!
    'Tis 
told me he hath very oft of late
    Given private time to you, and you yourself
    Have of your 
audience been most free and bounteous.
    If it be so- as so 'tis put on me,
    And that in way 
of caution- I must tell you
    You do not understand yourself so clearly
    As it behooves my da
ughter and your honour.
    What is between you? Give me up the truth.
  Oph. He hath, my lord, of
 late made many tenders
    Of his affection to me.
  Pol. Affection? Pooh! You speak like a green
 girl,
    Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
    Do you believe his tenders, as you call the
m?
  Oph. I do not know, my lord, what I should think,
  Pol. Marry, I will teach you! Think yours
elf a baby
    That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
    Which are not sterling. Tender 
yourself more dearly,
    Or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
    Running it thus) you'l
l tender me a fool.
  Oph. My lord, he hath importun'd me with love
    In honourable fashion.
  
Pol. Ay, fashion you may call it. Go to, go to!
  Oph. And hath given countenance to his speech, my
 lord,
    With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
  Pol. Ay, springes to catch woodcocks! I do k
now,
    When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
    Lends the tongue vows. These blazes, daug
hter,
    Giving more light than heat, extinct in both
    Even in their promise, as it is a-makin
g,
    You must not take for fire. From this time
    Be something scanter of your maiden presence
.
    Set your entreatments at a higher rate
    Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
    B
elieve so much in him, that he is young,
    And with a larger tether may he walk
    Than may be 
given you. In few, Ophelia,
    Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
    Not of that dye
 which their investments show,
    But mere implorators of unholy suits,
    Breathing like sancti
fied and pious bawds,
    The better to beguile. This is for all:
    I would not, in plain terms,
 from this time forth
    Have you so slander any moment leisure
    As to give words or talk with
 the Lord Hamlet.
    Look to't, I charge you. Come your ways.
  Oph. I shall obey, my lord.
    
                                                     Exeunt.




Scene IV.
Elsinore. The platf
orm before the Castle.

Enter Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus.

  Ham. The air bites shrewdly; it
 is very cold.
  Hor. It is a nipping and an eager air.
  Ham. What hour now?
  Hor. I think it l
acks of twelve.
  Mar. No, it is struck.
  Hor. Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws near the sea
son
    Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
                   A flourish of trumpets, and t
wo pieces go off.
    What does this mean, my lord?
  Ham. The King doth wake to-night and takes h
is rouse,
    Keeps wassail, and the swagg'ring upspring reels,
    And, as he drains his draughts
 of Rhenish down,
    The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out
    The triumph of his pledge.
  H
or. Is it a custom?
  Ham. Ay, marry, is't;
    But to my mind, though I am native here
    And t
o the manner born, it is a custom
    More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
    This he
avy-headed revel east and west
    Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations;
    They clip us 
drunkards and with swinish phrase
    Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
    From our achievem
ents, though perform'd at height,
    The pith and marrow of our attribute.
    So oft it chances 
in particular men
    That, for some vicious mole of nature in them,
    As in their birth,- where
in they are not guilty,
    Since nature cannot choose his origin,-
    By the o'ergrowth of some 
complexion,
    Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
    Or by some habit that too muc
h o'erleavens
    The form of plausive manners, that these men
    Carrying, I say, the stamp of o
ne defect,
    Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,
    Their virtues else- be they as pure a
s grace,
    As infinite as man may undergo-
    Shall in the general censure take corruption
   
 From that particular fault. The dram of e'il
    Doth all the noble substance often dout To his ow
n scandal.

                         Enter Ghost.

  Hor. Look, my lord, it comes!
  Ham. Angel
s and ministers of grace defend us!
    Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
    Bring wit
h thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
    Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
    Thou com
'st in such a questionable shape
    That I will speak to thee. I'll call thee Hamlet,
    King, f
ather, royal Dane. O, answer me?
    Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell
    Why thy canoniz'd
 bones, hearsed in death,
    Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre
    Wherein we saw the
e quietly inurn'd,
    Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws
    To cast thee up again. What may
 this mean
    That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,
    Revisits thus the glimpses of t
he moon,
    Making night hideous, and we fools of nature
    So horridly to shake our disposition

    With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
    Say, why is this? wherefore? What should w
e do?
                                           Ghost beckons Hamlet.
  Hor. It beckons you to go
 away with it,
    As if it some impartment did desire
    To you alone.
  Mar. Look with what co
urteous action
    It waves you to a more removed ground.
    But do not go with it!
  Hor. No, b
y no means!
  Ham. It will not speak. Then will I follow it.
  Hor. Do not, my lord!
  Ham. Why, 
what should be the fear?
    I do not set my life at a pin's fee;
    And for my soul, what can it
 do to that,
    Being a thing immortal as itself?
    It waves me forth again. I'll follow it.
 
 Hor. What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
    Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
 
   That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
    And there assume some other, horrible form
    Whi
ch might deprive your sovereignty of reason
    And draw you into madness? Think of it.
    The ve
ry place puts toys of desperation,
    Without more motive, into every brain
    That looks so man
y fadoms to the sea
    And hears it roar beneath.
  Ham. It waves me still.
    Go on. I'll foll
ow thee.
  Mar. You shall not go, my lord.
  Ham. Hold off your hands!
  Hor. Be rul'd. You shall
 not go.
  Ham. My fate cries out
    And makes each petty artire in this body
    As hardy as th
e Nemean lion's nerve.
                                                [Ghost beckons.]

    Stil
l am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
    By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!-
    I 
say, away!- Go on. I'll follow thee.
                                        Exeunt Ghost and Hamle
t.
  Hor. He waxes desperate with imagination.
  Mar. Let's follow. 'Tis not fit thus to obey him.

  Hor. Have after. To what issue will this come?
  Mar. Something is rotten in the state of Denma
rk.
  Hor. Heaven will direct it.
  Mar. Nay, let's follow him.
                                 
                        Exeunt.




Scene V.
Elsinore. The Castle. Another part of the fortifi
cations.

Enter Ghost and Hamlet.

  Ham. Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak! I'll go no further.

  Ghost. Mark me.
  Ham. I will.
  Ghost. My hour is almost come,
    When I to sulph'rous and t
ormenting flames
    Must render up myself.
  Ham. Alas, poor ghost!
  Ghost. Pity me not, but le
nd thy serious hearing
    To what I shall unfold.
  Ham. Speak. I am bound to hear.
  Ghost. So 
art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
  Ham. What?
  Ghost. I am thy father's spirit,
    Do
om'd for a certain term to walk the night,
    And for the day confin'd to fast in fires,
    Till
 the foul crimes done in my days of nature
    Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid
   
 To tell the secrets of my prison house,
    I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
    Would h
arrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
    Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their sphe
res,
    Thy knotted and combined locks to part,
    And each particular hair to stand on end
   
 Like quills upon the fretful porcupine.
    But this eternal blazon must not be
    To ears of fl
esh and blood. List, list, O, list!
    If thou didst ever thy dear father love-
  Ham. O God!
  
Ghost. Revenge his foul and most unnatural murther.
  Ham. Murther?
  Ghost. Murther most foul, as
 in the best it is;
    But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.
  Ham. Haste me to know't, tha
t I, with wings as swift
    As meditation or the thoughts of love,
    May sweep to my revenge.

  Ghost. I find thee apt;
    And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
    That rots itself i
n ease on Lethe wharf,
    Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.
    'Tis given out th
at, sleeping in my orchard,
    A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark
    Is by a forged
 process of my death
    Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth,
    The serpent that did sting
 thy father's life
    Now wears his crown.
  Ham. O my prophetic soul!
    My uncle?
  Ghost. A
y, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
    With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts-

    O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
    So to seduce!- won to his shameful lust
    Th
e will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.
    O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there,
    From me,
 whose love was of that dignity
    That it went hand in hand even with the vow
    I made to her 
in marriage, and to decline
    Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
    To those of mine!

    But virtue, as it never will be mov'd,
    Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
   
 So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
    Will sate itself in a celestial bed
    And prey o
n garbage.
    But soft! methinks I scent the morning air.
    Brief let me be. Sleeping within my
 orchard,
    My custom always of the afternoon,
    Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
    Wit
h juice of cursed hebona in a vial,
    And in the porches of my ears did pour
    The leperous di
stilment; whose effect
    Holds such an enmity with blood of man
    That swift as quicksilver it
 courses through
    The natural gates and alleys of the body,
    And with a sudden vigour it dot
h posset
    And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
    The thin and wholesome blood. So did it
 mine;
    And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
    Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome cr
ust
    All my smooth body.
    Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
    Of life, of crown, 
of queen, at once dispatch'd;
    Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
    Unhous'led, disappoi
nted, unanel'd,
    No reckoning made, but sent to my account
    With all my imperfections on my 
head.
  Ham. O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
  Ghost. If thou hast nature in thee, bear i
t not.
    Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
    A couch for luxury and damned incest.
    But,
 howsoever thou pursuest this act,
    Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
    Against t
hy mother aught. Leave her to heaven,
    And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge
    To prick
 and sting her. Fare thee well at once.
    The glowworm shows the matin to be near
    And gins t
o pale his uneffectual fire.
    Adieu, adieu, adieu! Remember me.                      Exit.

  
Ham. O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?
    And shall I couple hell? Hold, hold, my hear
t!
    And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
    But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?
    A
y, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
    In this distracted globe. Remember thee?
    Yea
, from the table of my memory
    I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
    All saws of books, 
all forms, all pressures past
    That youth and observation copied there,
    And thy commandment
 all alone shall live
    Within the book and volume of my brain,
    Unmix'd with baser matter. Y
es, by heaven!
    O most pernicious woman!
    O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
    
My tables! Meet it is I set it down
    That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
    At le
ast I am sure it may be so in Denmark.        [Writes.]
    So, uncle, there you are. Now to my wor
d:
    It is 'Adieu, adieu! Remember me.'
    I have sworn't.
  Hor. (within) My lord, my lord!


                   Enter Horatio and Marcellus.

  Mar. Lord Hamlet!
  Hor. Heaven secure him!

  Ham. So be it!
  Mar. Illo, ho, ho, my lord!
  Ham. Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.
  Ma
r. How is't, my noble lord?
  Hor. What news, my lord?
  Mar. O, wonderful!
  Hor. Good my lord, 
tell it.
  Ham. No, you will reveal it.
  Hor. Not I, my lord, by heaven!
  Mar. Nor I, my lord.

  Ham. How say you then? Would heart of man once think it?
    But you'll be secret?
  Both. Ay, 
by heaven, my lord.
  Ham. There's neer a villain dwelling in all Denmark
    But he's an arrant k
nave.
  Hor. There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
    To tell us this.
  Ham. Why, 
right! You are in the right!
    And so, without more circumstance at all,
    I hold it fit that 
we shake hands and part;
    You, as your business and desires shall point you,
    For every man 
hath business and desire,
    Such as it is; and for my own poor part,
    Look you, I'll go pray.

  Hor. These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
  Ham. I am sorry they offend you, heartil
y;
    Yes, faith, heartily.
  Hor. There's no offence, my lord.
  Ham. Yes, by Saint Patrick, bu
t there is, Horatio,
    And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
    It is an honest ghos
t, that let me tell you.
    For your desire to know what is between us,
    O'ermaster't as you m
ay. And now, good friends,
    As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,
    Give me one poor re
quest.
  Hor. What is't, my lord? We will.
  Ham. Never make known what you have seen to-night.
 
 Both. My lord, we will not.
  Ham. Nay, but swear't.
  Hor. In faith,
    My lord, not I.
  Mar
. Nor I, my lord- in faith.
  Ham. Upon my sword.
  Mar. We have sworn, my lord, already.
  Ham. 
Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.

                 Ghost cries under the stage.

  Ghost. Swear.

  Ham. Aha boy, say'st thou so? Art thou there, truepenny?
    Come on! You hear this fellow in the
 cellarage.
    Consent to swear.
  Hor. Propose the oath, my lord.
  Ham. Never to speak of this
 that you have seen.
    Swear by my sword.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
  Ham. Hic et ubique? Then 
we'll shift our ground.
    Come hither, gentlemen,
    And lay your hands again upon my sword.
 
   Never to speak of this that you have heard:
    Swear by my sword.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear by 
his sword.
  Ham. Well said, old mole! Canst work i' th' earth so fast?
    A worthy pioner! Once 
more remove, good friends."
  Hor. O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
  Ham. And there
fore as a stranger give it welcome.
    There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
    Th
an are dreamt of in your philosophy.
    But come!
    Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,

    How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself
    (As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
    To
 put an antic disposition on),
    That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
    With arms e
ncumb'red thus, or this head-shake,
    Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
    As 'Well, w
ell, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'
    Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if the
y might,'
    Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
    That you know aught of me- this is not to 
do,
    So grace and mercy at your most need help you,
    Swear.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
    
                                               [They swear.]
  Ham. Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! S
o, gentlemen,
    With all my love I do commend me to you;
    And what so poor a man as Hamlet is

    May do t' express his love and friending to you,
    God willing, shall not lack. Let us go i
n together;
    And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
    The time is out of joint. O curse
d spite
    That ever I was born to set it right!
    Nay, come, let's go together.
             
                                            Exeunt.

Act II. Scene I.
Elsinore.
 A room in the house of Polonius.

Enter Polonius and Reynaldo.

  Pol. Give him this money and 
these notes, Reynaldo.
  Rey. I will, my lord.
  Pol. You shall do marvell's wisely, good Reynaldo
,
    Before You visit him, to make inquire
    Of his behaviour.
  Rey. My lord, I did intend it
.
  Pol. Marry, well said, very well said. Look you, sir,
    Enquire me first what Danskers are i
n Paris;
    And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
    What company, at what expense;
 and finding
    By this encompassment and drift of question
    That they do know my son, come yo
u more nearer
    Than your particular demands will touch it.
    Take you, as 'twere, some distan
t knowledge of him;
    As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
    And in part him.' Do you 
mark this, Reynaldo?
  Rey. Ay, very well, my lord.
  Pol. 'And in part him, but,' you may say, 'n
ot well.
    But if't be he I mean, he's very wild
    Addicted so and so'; and there put on him

    What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
    As may dishonour him- take heed of that;
  
  But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips
    As are companions noted and most known
    To y
outh and liberty.
  Rey. As gaming, my lord.
  Pol. Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrellin
g,
    Drabbing. You may go so far.
  Rey. My lord, that would dishonour him.
  Pol. Faith, no, a
s you may season it in the charge.
    You must not put another scandal on him,
    That he is ope
n to incontinency.
    That's not my meaning. But breathe his faults so quaintly
    That they may
 seem the taints of liberty,
    The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
    A savageness in unrec
laimed blood,
    Of general assault.
  Rey. But, my good lord-
  Pol. Wherefore should you do th
is?
  Rey. Ay, my lord,
    I would know that.
  Pol. Marry, sir, here's my drift,
    And I bel
ieve it is a fetch of warrant.
    You laying these slight sullies on my son
    As 'twere a thing
 a little soil'd i' th' working,
    Mark you,
    Your party in converse, him you would sound,
 
   Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
    The youth you breathe of guilty, be assur'd
    
He closes with you in this consequence:
    'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman'-
    Ac
cording to the phrase or the addition
    Of man and country-
  Rey. Very good, my lord.
  Pol. A
nd then, sir, does 'a this- 'a does- What was I about to
say?
    By the mass, I was about to say 
something! Where did I leave?
  Rey. At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,' and
    ge
ntleman.'
  Pol. At 'closes in the consequence'- Ay, marry!
    He closes thus: 'I know the gentle
man.
    I saw him yesterday, or t'other day,
    Or then, or then, with such or such; and, as you
 say,
    There was 'a gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
    There falling out at tennis'; or per
chance,
    'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'
    Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
    Se
e you now-
    Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth;
    And thus do we of wisdom and o
f reach,
    With windlasses and with assays of bias,
    By indirections find directions out.
  
  So, by my former lecture and advice,
    Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?
  Rey. My 
lord, I have.
  Pol. God b' wi' ye, fare ye well!
  Rey. Good my lord!                            
        [Going.]
  Pol. Observe his inclination in yourself.
  Rey. I shall, my lord.
  Pol. And 
let him ply his music.
  Rey. Well, my lord.
  Pol. Farewell!
                                   
               Exit Reynaldo.

                       Enter Ophelia.

    How now, Ophelia? What
's the matter?
  Oph. O my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
  Pol. With what, i' th' name
 of God?
  Oph. My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
    Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbra
c'd,
    No hat upon his head, his stockings foul'd,
    Ungart'red, and down-gyved to his ankle;

    Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,
    And with a look so piteous in purport
 
   As if he had been loosed out of hell
    To speak of horrors- he comes before me.
  Pol. Mad fo
r thy love?
  Oph. My lord, I do not know,
    But truly I do fear it.
  Pol. What said he?
  Op
h. He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
    Then goes he to the length of all his arm,
    An
d, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
    He falls to such perusal of my face
    As he would
 draw it. Long stay'd he so.
    At last, a little shaking of mine arm,
    And thrice his head th
us waving up and down,
    He rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound
    As it did seem to shatter 
all his bulk
    And end his being. That done, he lets me go,
    And with his head over his shoul
der turn'd
    He seem'd to find his way without his eyes,
    For out o' doors he went without th
eir help
    And to the last bended their light on me.
  Pol. Come, go with me. I will go seek the
 King.
    This is the very ecstasy of love,
    Whose violent property fordoes itself
    And le
ads the will to desperate undertakings
    As oft as any passion under heaven
    That does afflic
t our natures. I am sorry.
    What, have you given him any hard words of late?
  Oph. No, my good
 lord; but, as you did command,
    I did repel his letters and denied
    His access to me.
  Po
l. That hath made him mad.
    I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
    I had not quoted 
him. I fear'd he did but trifle
    And meant to wrack thee; but beshrew my jealousy!
    By heave
n, it is as proper to our age
    To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
    As it is common for
 the younger sort
    To lack discretion. Come, go we to the King.
    This must be known; which, 
being kept close, might move
    More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
    Come.
          
                                               Exeunt.

Scene II.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.


Flourish. [Enter King and Queen, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern,
cum aliis.

  King. Welcome, d
ear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
    Moreover that we much did long to see you,
    The need we h
ave to use you did provoke
    Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
    Of Hamlet's transfo
rmation. So I call it,
    Sith nor th' exterior nor the inward man
    Resembles that it was. Wha
t it should be,
    More than his father's death, that thus hath put him
    So much from th' unde
rstanding of himself,
    I cannot dream of. I entreat you both
    That, being of so young days b
rought up with him,
    And since so neighbour'd to his youth and haviour,
    That you vouchsafe 
your rest here in our court
    Some little time; so by your companies
    To draw him on to pleas
ures, and to gather
    So much as from occasion you may glean,
    Whether aught to us unknown af
flicts him thus
    That, open'd, lies within our remedy.
  Queen. Good gentlemen, he hath much ta
lk'd of you,
    And sure I am two men there are not living
    To whom he more adheres. If it wil
l please you
    To show us so much gentry and good will
    As to expend your time with us awhile

    For the supply and profit of our hope,
    Your visitation shall receive such thanks
    As 
fits a king's remembrance.
  Ros. Both your Majesties
    Might, by the sovereign power you have o
f us,
    Put your dread pleasures more into command
    Than to entreaty.
  Guil. But we both ob
ey,
    And here give up ourselves, in the full bent,
    To lay our service freely at your feet,

    To be commanded.
  King. Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
  Queen. Thanks, Guilde
nstern and gentle Rosencrantz.
    And I beseech you instantly to visit
    My too much changed so
n.- Go, some of you,
    And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
  Guil. Heavens make our prese
nce and our practices
    Pleasant and helpful to him!
  Queen. Ay, amen!
                 Exeunt
 Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, [with some
                                                    Atten
dants].

                         Enter Polonius.

  Pol. Th' ambassadors from Norway, my good l
ord,
    Are joyfully return'd.
  King. Thou still hast been the father of good news.
  Pol. Have
 I, my lord? Assure you, my good liege,
    I hold my duty as I hold my soul,
    Both to my God a
nd to my gracious king;
    And I do think- or else this brain of mine
    Hunts not the trail of 
policy so sure
    As it hath us'd to do- that I have found
    The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.

  King. O, speak of that! That do I long to hear.
  Pol. Give first admittance to th' ambassadors
.
    My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
  King. Thyself do grace to them, and bring 
them in.
                                                [Exit Polonius.]
    He tells me, my dear
 Gertrude, he hath found
    The head and source of all your son's distemper.
  Queen. I doubt it 
is no other but the main,
    His father's death and our o'erhasty marriage.
  King. Well, we shal
l sift him.

              Enter Polonius, Voltemand, and Cornelius.

    Welcome, my good frien
ds.
    Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?
  Volt. Most fair return of greetings and de
sires.
    Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
    His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd

    To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack,
    But better look'd into, he truly found
    It was
 against your Highness; whereat griev'd,
    That so his sickness, age, and impotence
    Was fals
ely borne in hand, sends out arrests
    On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys,
    Receives re
buke from Norway, and, in fine,
    Makes vow before his uncle never more
    To give th' assay of
 arms against your Majesty.
    Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
    Gives him three thousan
d crowns in annual fee
    And his commission to employ those soldiers,
    So levied as before, a
gainst the Polack;
    With an entreaty, herein further shown,
                                   
             [Gives a paper.]
    That it might please you to give quiet pass
    Through your dom
inions for this enterprise,
    On such regards of safety and allowance
    As therein are set dow
n.
  King. It likes us well;
    And at our more consider'd time we'll read,
    Answer, and thin
k upon this business.
    Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour.
    Go to your rest; at
 night we'll feast together.
    Most welcome home!                       Exeunt Ambassadors.
  Po
l. This business is well ended.
    My liege, and madam, to expostulate
    What majesty should be
, what duty is,
    Why day is day, night is night, and time is time.
    Were nothing but to wast
e night, day, and time.
    Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
    And tediousness the l
imbs and outward flourishes,
    I will be brief. Your noble son is mad.
    Mad call I it; for, t
o define true madness,
    What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
    But let that go.
  Queen
. More matter, with less art.
  Pol. Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
    That he is mad, 'tis 
true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
    And pity 'tis 'tis true. A foolish figure!
    But farewell it, for
 I will use no art.
    Mad let us grant him then. And now remains
    That we find out the cause 
of this effect-
    Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
    For this effect defective comes b
y cause.
    Thus it remains, and the remainder thus.
    Perpend.
    I have a daughter (have wh
ile she is mine),
    Who in her duty and obedience, mark,
    Hath given me this. Now gather, and
 surmise.
                                             [Reads] the letter.
    'To the celestial, 
and my soul's idol, the most beautified
      Ophelia,'-

    That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase
; 'beautified' is a vile
      phrase.
    But you shall hear. Thus:
                            
                            [Reads.]
    'In her excellent white bosom, these, &c.'
  Queen. Came 
this from Hamlet to her?
  Pol. Good madam, stay awhile. I will be faithful.     [Reads.]


    
      'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
            Doubt that the sun doth move;
          Doubt tr
uth to be a liar;
            But never doubt I love.
      'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these num
bers; I have not art
to
    reckon my groans; but that I love thee best, O most best,
believe
  
  it. Adieu.
      'Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to
him,

HAMLET.'


    This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me;
    And more above, hath his solicitings,
    A
s they fell out by time, by means, and place,
    All given to mine ear.
  King. But how hath she

    Receiv'd his love?
  Pol. What do you think of me?
  King. As of a man faithful and honourabl
e.
  Pol. I would fain prove so. But what might you think,
    When I had seen this hot love on th
e wing
    (As I perceiv'd it, I must tell you that,
    Before my daughter told me), what might y
ou,
    Or my dear Majesty your queen here, think,
    If I had play'd the desk or table book,
  
  Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
    Or look'd upon this love with idle sight?
    Wh
at might you think? No, I went round to work
    And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
    'Lo
rd Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star.
    This must not be.' And then I prescripts gave her,
   
 That she should lock herself from his resort,
    Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
    Whi
ch done, she took the fruits of my advice,
    And he, repulsed, a short tale to make,
    Fell in
to a sadness, then into a fast,
    Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
    Thence to a lig
htness, and, by this declension,
    Into the madness wherein now he raves,
    And all we mourn f
or.
  King. Do you think 'tis this?
  Queen. it may be, very like.
  Pol. Hath there been such a 
time- I would fain know that-
    That I have Positively said ''Tis so,'
    When it prov'd otherw
ise.?
  King. Not that I know.
  Pol. [points to his head and shoulder] Take this from this, if
t
his
      be otherwise.
    If circumstances lead me, I will find
    Where truth is hid, though 
it were hid indeed
    Within the centre.
  King. How may we try it further?
  Pol. You know some
times he walks for hours together
    Here in the lobby.
  Queen. So he does indeed.
  Pol. At su
ch a time I'll loose my daughter to him.
    Be you and I behind an arras then.
    Mark the encou
nter. If he love her not,
    And he not from his reason fall'n thereon
    Let me be no assistant
 for a state,
    But keep a farm and carters.
  King. We will try it.

                 Enter H
amlet, reading on a book.

  Queen. But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
  Pol. Aw
ay, I do beseech you, both away
    I'll board him presently. O, give me leave.
                  
     Exeunt King and Queen, [with Attendants].
    How does my good Lord Hamlet?
  Ham. Well, God-
a-mercy.
  Pol. Do you know me, my lord?
  Ham. Excellent well. You are a fishmonger.
  Pol. Not 
I, my lord.
  Ham. Then I would you were so honest a man.
  Pol. Honest, my lord?
  Ham. Ay, sir.
 To be honest, as this world goes, is to be one
man
    pick'd out of ten thousand.
  Pol. That's
 very true, my lord.
  Ham. For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god
    kissing ca
rrion- Have you a daughter?
  Pol. I have, my lord.
  Ham. Let her not walk i' th' sun. Conception
 is a blessing, but
not
    as your daughter may conceive. Friend, look to't.
  Pol. [aside] How 
say you by that? Still harping on my daughter.
Yet
    he knew me not at first. He said I was a fi
shmonger. He is
far
    gone, far gone! And truly in my youth I suff'red much
extremity
    for 
love- very near this. I'll speak to him again.- What do
you
    read, my lord?
  Ham. Words, word
s, words.
  Pol. What is the matter, my lord?
  Ham. Between who?
  Pol. I mean, the matter that 
you read, my lord.
  Ham. Slanders, sir; for the satirical rogue says here that old
men
    have 
grey beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes
    purging thick amber and plum-tree gum; a
nd that they have a
    plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams. All
which,
    sir, 
though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I
hold it
    not honesty to have it thus set d
own; for you yourself, sir,
    should be old as I am if, like a crab, you could go backward.

  
Pol. [aside] Though this be madness, yet there is a method
in't.-
   Will You walk out of the air,
 my lord?
  Ham. Into my grave?
  Pol. Indeed, that is out o' th' air. [Aside] How pregnant
somet
imes
    his replies are! a happiness that often madness hits on,
which
    reason and sanity cou
ld not so prosperously be delivered of.
I
    will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of me
eting
between
    him and my daughter.- My honourable lord, I will most humbly
take
    my leave
 of you.
  Ham. You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more
    willingly part withal-
 except my life, except my life, except
my
    life,

                    Enter Rosencrantz and 
Guildenstern.

  Pol. Fare you well, my lord.
  Ham. These tedious old fools!
  Pol. You go to s
eek the Lord Hamlet. There he is.
  Ros. [to Polonius] God save you, sir!
                        
                        Exit [Polonius].

  Guil. My honour'd lord!
  Ros. My most dear lord!
  
Ham. My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern?
Ah,
    Rosencrantz! Good lads, how d
o ye both?
  Ros. As the indifferent children of the earth.
  Guil. Happy in that we are not over-
happy.
    On Fortune's cap we are not the very button.
  Ham. Nor the soles of her shoe?
  Ros. 
Neither, my lord.
  Ham. Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her
    favours?
  Gu
il. Faith, her privates we.
  Ham. In the secret parts of Fortune? O! most true! she is a
    stru
mpet. What news ?
  Ros. None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
  Ham. Then is doomsday
 near! But your news is not true. Let me
    question more in particular. What have you, my good fr
iends,
    deserved at the hands of Fortune that she sends you to prison
    hither?
  Guil. Pris
on, my lord?
  Ham. Denmark's a prison.
  Ros. Then is the world one.
  Ham. A goodly one; in whi
ch there are many confines, wards, and
    dungeons, Denmark being one o' th' worst.
  Ros. We thi
nk not so, my lord.
  Ham. Why, then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either
good
    or ba
d but thinking makes it so. To me it is a prison.
  Ros. Why, then your ambition makes it one. 'Tis
 too narrow for
your
    mind.
  Ham. O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a

    king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.
  Guil. Which dreams indeed are am
bition; for the very substance
of
    the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
  Ham. A dre
am itself is but a shadow.
  Ros. Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality
that

    it is but a shadow's shadow.
  Ham. Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and
outstret
ch'd
    heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we to th' court? for, by
my
    fay, I cannot reason.

  Both. We'll wait upon you.
  Ham. No such matter! I will not sort you with the rest of my
    
servants; for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most
    dreadfully attended. But in the be
aten way of friendship,
what
    make you at Elsinore?
  Ros. To visit you, my lord; no other occ
asion.
  Ham. Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank
you;
    and sure, dear fri
ends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny.
Were
    you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is 
it a free
    visitation? Come, deal justly with me. Come, come! Nay,
speak.
  Guil. What should 
we say, my lord?
  Ham. Why, anything- but to th' purpose. You were sent for; and
    there is a k
ind of confession in your looks, which your
modesties
    have not craft enough to colour. I know 
the good King and
Queen
    have sent for you.
  Ros. To what end, my lord?
  Ham. That you must
 teach me. But let me conjure you by the
rights
    of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our yo
uth, by the
    obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear
a
    better propose
r could charge you withal, be even and direct
with
    me, whether you were sent for or no.
  Ros
. [aside to Guildenstern] What say you?
  Ham. [aside] Nay then, I have an eye of you.- If you love
 me,
hold
    not off.
  Guil. My lord, we were sent for.
  Ham. I will tell you why. So shall m
y anticipation prevent your
    discovery, and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no
    fea
ther. I have of late- but wherefore I know not- lost all
my
    mirth, forgone all custom of exerc
ises; and indeed, it goes
so
    heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the
earth,

    seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy,
the
    air, look you, this brav
e o'erhanging firmament, this
majestical
    roof fretted with golden fire- why, it appeareth no o
ther
thing
    to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What
a
    piece of work
 is a man! how noble in reason! how infinite in
    faculties! in form and moving how express and a
dmirable! in
    action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the
    beauty of the w
orld, the paragon of animals! And yet to me
what
    is this quintessence of dust? Man delights no
t me- no, nor
woman
    neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.
  Ros. My lord, there
 was no such stuff in my thoughts.
  Ham. Why did you laugh then, when I said 'Man delights not me'
?
  Ros. To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten
    entertainment the players s
hall receive from you. We coted
them
    on the way, and hither are they coming to offer you servi
ce.
  Ham. He that plays the king shall be welcome- his Majesty shall
    have tribute of me; the 
adventurous knight shall use his foil
and
    target; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humorou
s man
shall
    end his part in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose
    lungs are tickl
e o' th' sere; and the lady shall say her mind
    freely, or the blank verse shall halt for't. Wha
t players are
    they?
  Ros. Even those you were wont to take such delight in, the
    tragedia
ns of the city.
  Ham. How chances it they travel? Their residence, both in
    reputation and pro
fit, was better both ways.
  Ros. I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late
    inno
vation.
  Ham. Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in
the
    city? Are they so 
follow'd?
  Ros. No indeed are they not.
  Ham. How comes it? Do they grow rusty?
  Ros. Nay, the
ir endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there
is,
    sir, an eyrie of children, little eyases,
 that cry out on the
top
    of question and are most tyrannically clapp'd for't. These
are now

    the fashion, and so berattle the common stages (so they call
    them) that many wearing rapier
s are afraid of goosequills and
    dare scarce come thither.
  Ham. What, are they children? Who 
maintains 'em? How are they
    escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can
    
sing? Will they not say afterwards, if they should grow
    themselves to common players (as it is 
most like, if their
means
    are no better), their writers do them wrong to make them
exclaim
 
   against their own succession.
  Ros. Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the
na
tion
    holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy. There was, for
a
    while, no money bid f
or argument unless the poet and the
player
    went to cuffs in the question.
  Ham. Is't possibl
e?
  Guil. O, there has been much throwing about of brains.
  Ham. Do the boys carry it away?
  R
os. Ay, that they do, my lord- Hercules and his load too.
  Ham. It is not very strange; for my unc
le is King of Denmark,
and
    those that would make mows at him while my father lived give
    t
wenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his picture
in
    little. 'Sblood, there is some
thing in this more than
natural, if
    philosophy could find it out.

                     Flou
rish for the Players.

  Guil. There are the players.
  Ham. Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsino
re. Your hands, come!
Th'
    appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me
comply
   
 with you in this garb, lest my extent to the players (which I
    tell you must show fairly outwar
ds) should more appear like
    entertainment than yours. You are welcome. But my
uncle-father
  
  and aunt-mother are deceiv'd.
  Guil. In what, my dear lord?
  Ham. I am but mad north-north-wes
t. When the wind is southerly
I
    know a hawk from a handsaw.

                            Ent
er Polonius.

  Pol. Well be with you, gentlemen!
  Ham. Hark you, Guildenstern- and you too- at 
each ear a hearer!
    That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling
    clouts.

  Ros. Happily he's the second time come to them; for they say an
old
    man is twice a child.
 
 Ham. I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players. Mark
it.-
   You say right, sir; a Monda
y morning; twas so indeed.
  Pol. My lord, I have news to tell you.
  Ham. My lord, I have news to
 tell you. When Roscius was an
actor in
    Rome-
  Pol. The actors are come hither, my lord.
  
Ham. Buzz, buzz!
  Pol. Upon my honour-
  Ham. Then came each actor on his ass-
  Pol. The best a
ctors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy,
    history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical
-pastoral,
    tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral;
scene
    individable, 
or poem unlimited. Seneca cannot be too heavy,
nor
    Plautus too light. For the law of writ and 
the liberty, these
are
    the only men.
  Ham. O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hads
t thou!
  Pol. What treasure had he, my lord?
  Ham. Why,

         'One fair daughter, and no m
ore,
           The which he loved passing well.'

  Pol. [aside] Still on my daughter.
  Ham. A
m I not i' th' right, old Jephthah?
  Pol. If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that
 I
    love passing well.
  Ham. Nay, that follows not.
  Pol. What follows then, my lord?
  Ham
. Why,

           'As by lot, God wot,'

 and then, you know,

           'It came to pass, a
s most like it was.'

    The first row of the pious chanson will show you more; for
look
    wh
ere my abridgment comes.

                     Enter four or five Players.

    You are welcome,
 masters; welcome, all.- I am glad to see
thee
    well.- Welcome, good friends.- O, my old friend
? Why, thy
face is
    valanc'd since I saw thee last. Com'st' thou to' beard me in
    Denmark?-
 What, my young lady and mistress? By'r Lady, your
    ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw
 you last by the
    altitude of a chopine. Pray God your voice, like a piece of
    uncurrent gol
d, be not crack'd within the ring.- Masters, you
are
    all welcome. We'll e'en to't like French 
falconers, fly at
    anything we see. We'll have a speech straight. Come, give us
a
    taste of
 your quality. Come, a passionate speech.
  1. Play. What speech, my good lord?
  Ham. I heard the
e speak me a speech once, but it was never
acted;
    or if it was, not above once; for the play, 
I remember,
pleas'd
    not the million, 'twas caviary to the general; but it was (as
I
    rece
iv'd it, and others, whose judgments in such matters
cried in
    the top of mine) an excellent pl
ay, well digested in the
scenes,
    set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember one said

    there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter
savoury,
    nor no matter in the phra
se that might indict the author of
    affectation; but call'd it an honest method, as wholesome as

    sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech
in't
    I chiefly lov'd. 'Twas 
AEneas' tale to Dido, and thereabout
of it
    especially where he speaks of Priam's slaughter. If
 it live
in
    your memory, begin at this line- let me see, let me see:

         'The rugged P
yrrhus, like th' Hyrcanian beast-'

    'Tis not so; it begins with Pyrrhus:

         'The rugg
ed Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
         Black as his purpose, did the night resemble
         Wh
en he lay couched in the ominous horse,
         Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd

         With heraldry more dismal. Head to foot
         Now is be total gules, horridly trick'd

         With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
         Bak'd and impasted with the parc
hing streets,
         That lend a tyrannous and a damned light
         To their lord's murther. 
Roasted in wrath and fire,
         And thus o'ersized with coagulate gore,
         With eyes lik
e carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
         Old grandsire Priam seeks.'

    So, proceed you.
  P
ol. Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good
     discretion.

  1. Play. 'Anon 
he finds him,
      Striking too short at Greeks. His antique sword,
      Rebellious to his arm, 
lies where it falls,
      Repugnant to command. Unequal match'd,
      Pyrrhus at Priam drives, i
n rage strikes wide;
      But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
      Th' unnerved father
 falls. Then senseless Ilium,
      Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
      Stoops to hi
s base, and with a hideous crash
      Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear. For lo! his sword,
      Which
 was declining on the milky head
      Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' th' air to stick.
      So, as
 a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
      And, like a neutral to his will and matter,
      Did noth
ing.
      But, as we often see, against some storm,
      A silence in the heavens, the rack stan
d still,
      The bold winds speechless, and the orb below
      As hush as death- anon the dread
ful thunder
      Doth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
      Aroused vengeance sets him
 new awork;
      And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
      On Mars's armour, forg'd for proof
 eterne,
      With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
      Now falls on Priam.
      Out
, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods,
      In general synod take away her power;
      Brea
k all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
      And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,

      As low as to the fiends!

  Pol. This is too long.
  Ham. It shall to the barber's, with 
your beard.- Prithee say
on.
    He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps. Say on;
come t
o
    Hecuba.

  1. Play. 'But who, O who, had seen the mobled queen-'

  Ham. 'The mobled quee
n'?
  Pol. That's good! 'Mobled queen' is good.

  1. Play. 'Run barefoot up and down, threat'nin
g the flames
      With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head
      Where late the diadem stood, an
d for a robe,
      About her lank and all o'erteemed loins,
      A blanket, in the alarm of fear
 caught up-
      Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd
      'Gainst Fortune's state wo
uld treason have pronounc'd.
      But if the gods themselves did see her then,
      When she saw
 Pyrrhus make malicious sport
      In Mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,
      The insta
nt burst of clamour that she made
      (Unless things mortal move them not at all)
      Would ha
ve made milch the burning eyes of heaven
      And passion in the gods.'

  Pol. Look, whe'r he h
as not turn'd his colour, and has tears
in's
    eyes. Prithee no more!
  Ham. 'Tis well. I'll ha
ve thee speak out the rest of this
soon.-
    Good my lord, will you see the players well bestow'd
? Do you
    hear? Let them be well us'd; for they are the abstract and
brief
    chronicles of t
he time. After your death you were better have
a
    bad epitaph than their ill report while you l
ive.
  Pol. My lord, I will use them according to their desert.
  Ham. God's bodykins, man, much b
etter! Use every man after his
    desert, and who should scape whipping? Use them after your
own

    honour and dignity. The less they deserve, the more merit is
in
    your bounty. Take them in
.
  Pol. Come, sirs.
  Ham. Follow him, friends. We'll hear a play to-morrow.
                 Ex
eunt Polonius and Players [except the First].
    Dost thou hear me, old friend? Can you play 'The 
Murther of
    Gonzago'?
  1. Play. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, fo
r a need, study a
    speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which I would set down
and
    insert
 in't, could you not?
  1. Play. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Very well. Follow that lord- and look you moc
k him not.
                                            [Exit First Player.]
    My good friends, I
'll leave you till night. You are welcome
to
    Elsinore.
  Ros. Good my lord!
  Ham. Ay, so, G
od b' wi' ye!
                            [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
    Now I am alone.

    O what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
    Is it not monstrous that this player here,
    Bu
t in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
    Could force his soul so to his own conceit
    That, fr
om her working, all his visage wann'd,
    Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
    A broke
n voice, and his whole function suiting
    With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!
    Fo
r Hecuba!
    What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
    That he should weep for her? What would h
e do,
    Had he the motive and the cue for passion
    That I have? He would drown the stage with
 tears
    And cleave the general ear with horrid speech;
    Make mad the guilty and appal the fr
ee,
    Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed
    The very faculties of eyes and ears.
    Yet 
I,
    A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak
    Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
    
And can say nothing! No, not for a king,
    Upon whose property and most dear life
    A damn'd d
efeat was made. Am I a coward?
    Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
    Plucks off my 
beard and blows it in my face?
    Tweaks me by th' nose? gives me the lie i' th' throat
    As de
ep as to the lungs? Who does me this, ha?
    'Swounds, I should take it! for it cannot be
    But
 I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall
    To make oppression bitter, or ere this
    I should have fa
tted all the region kites
    With this slave's offal. Bloody bawdy villain!
    Remorseless, trea
cherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
    O, vengeance!
    Why, what an ass am I! This is most br
ave,
    That I, the son of a dear father murther'd,
    Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell
,
    Must (like a whore) unpack my heart with words
    And fall a-cursing like a very drab,
   
 A scullion!
    Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! Hum, I have heard
    That guilty creatures, si
tting at a play,
    Have by the very cunning of the scene
    Been struck so to the soul that pre
sently
    They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
    For murther, though it have no tongue, wil
l speak
    With most miraculous organ, I'll have these Players
    Play something like the murthe
r of my father
    Before mine uncle. I'll observe his looks;
    I'll tent him to the quick. If h
e but blench,
    I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
    May be a devil; and the devil 
hath power
    T' assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
    Out of my weakness and my melancho
ly,
    As he is very potent with such spirits,
    Abuses me to damn me. I'll have grounds
    M
ore relative than this. The play's the thing
    Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King.    
     Exit.

ACT III. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King, Qu
een, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern,
and Lords.

  King. And can you by no drift of
 circumstance
    Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
    Grating so harshly all his days 
of quiet
    With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
  Ros. He does confess he feels himself distract
ed,
    But from what cause he will by no means speak.
  Guil. Nor do we find him forward to be so
unded,
    But with a crafty madness keeps aloof
    When we would bring him on to some confession

    Of his true state.
  Queen. Did he receive you well?
  Ros. Most like a gentleman.
  Guil. 
But with much forcing of his disposition.
  Ros. Niggard of question, but of our demands
    Most 
free in his reply.
  Queen. Did you assay him
    To any pastime?
  Ros. Madam, it so fell out th
at certain players
    We o'erraught on the way. Of these we told him,
    And there did seem in h
im a kind of joy
    To hear of it. They are here about the court,
    And, as I think, they have 
already order
    This night to play before him.
  Pol. 'Tis most true;
    And he beseech'd me t
o entreat your Majesties
    To hear and see the matter.
  King. With all my heart, and it doth mu
ch content me
    To hear him so inclin'd.
    Good gentlemen, give him a further edge
    And dr
ive his purpose on to these delights.
  Ros. We shall, my lord.
                            Exeunt
 Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
  King. Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
    For we have closely sent 
for Hamlet hither,
    That he, as 'twere by accident, may here
    Affront Ophelia.
    Her fath
er and myself (lawful espials)
    Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing unseen,
    We may of the
ir encounter frankly judge
    And gather by him, as he is behav'd,
    If't be th' affliction of 
his love, or no,
    That thus he suffers for.
  Queen. I shall obey you;
    And for your part, 
Ophelia, I do wish
    That your good beauties be the happy cause
    Of Hamlet's wildness. So sha
ll I hope your virtues
    Will bring him to his wonted way again,
    To both your honours.
  Op
h. Madam, I wish it may.
                                                   [Exit Queen.]
  Pol. O
phelia, walk you here.- Gracious, so please you,
    We will bestow ourselves.- [To Ophelia] Read o
n this book,
    That show of such an exercise may colour
    Your loneliness.- We are oft to blam
e in this,
    'Tis too much prov'd, that with devotion's visage
    And pious action we do sugar 
o'er
    The Devil himself.
  King. [aside] O, 'tis too true!
    How smart a lash that speech do
th give my conscience!
    The harlot's cheek, beautied with plast'ring art,
    Is not more ugly 
to the thing that helps it
    Than is my deed to my most painted word.
    O heavy burthen!
  Po
l. I hear him coming. Let's withdraw, my lord.
                                      Exeunt King an
d Polonius].

                           Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. To be, or not to be- that is the 
question:
    Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
    The slings and arrows of outrageous fo
rtune
    Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
    And by opposing end them. To die- to slee
p-
    No more; and by a sleep to say we end
    The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks
 
   That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation
    Devoutly to be wish'd. To die- to sleep.
    To 
sleep- perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub!
    For in that sleep of death what dreams may come

    When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
    Must give us pause. There's the respect
    
That makes calamity of so long life.
    For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
    Th' 
oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
    The pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay,
   
 The insolence of office, and the spurns
    That patient merit of th' unworthy takes,
    When he
 himself might his quietus make
    With a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear,
    To grunt
 and sweat under a weary life,
    But that the dread of something after death-
    The undiscover
'd country, from whose bourn
    No traveller returns- puzzles the will,
    And makes us rather b
ear those ills we have
    Than fly to others that we know not of?
    Thus conscience does make c
owards of us all,
    And thus the native hue of resolution
    Is sicklied o'er with the pale cas
t of thought,
    And enterprises of great pith and moment
    With this regard their currents tur
n awry
    And lose the name of action.- Soft you now!
    The fair Ophelia!- Nymph, in thy orison
s
    Be all my sins rememb'red.
  Oph. Good my lord,
    How does your honour for this many a da
y?
  Ham. I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
  Oph. My lord, I have remembrances of yours
    
That I have longed long to re-deliver.
    I pray you, now receive them.
  Ham. No, not I!
    I 
never gave you aught.
  Oph. My honour'd lord, you know right well you did,
    And with them word
s of so sweet breath compos'd
    As made the things more rich. Their perfume lost,
    Take these
 again; for to the noble mind
    Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
    There, my lord
.
  Ham. Ha, ha! Are you honest?
  Oph. My lord?
  Ham. Are you fair?
  Oph. What means your lor
dship?
  Ham. That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit
no
    discourse to your 
beauty.
  Oph. Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with
honesty?
  Ham. Ay, truly; f
or the power of beauty will sooner transform
    honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force o
f honesty
can
    translate beauty into his likeness. This was sometime a
paradox,
    but now t
he time gives it proof. I did love you once.
  Oph. Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
  Ham
. You should not have believ'd me; for virtue cannot so
    inoculate our old stock but we shall re
lish of it. I loved
you
    not.
  Oph. I was the more deceived.
  Ham. Get thee to a nunnery! W
hy wouldst thou be a breeder of
    sinners? I am myself indifferent honest, but yet I could
accus
e
    me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne
me.
    I am very proud, reve
ngeful, ambitious; with more offences at
my
    beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imaginat
ion to give
    them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows
as I
    do, crawlin
g between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves
all;
    believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nun
nery. Where's your
    father?
  Oph. At home, my lord.
  Ham. Let the doors be shut upon him, th
at he may play the fool
    nowhere but in's own house. Farewell.
  Oph. O, help him, you sweet he
avens!
  Ham. If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy
dowry:
    be thou as chaste
 as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not
escape
    calumny. Get thee to a nunnery. Go, farewell. 
Or if thou wilt
    needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what
    monsters you
 make of them. To a nunnery, go; and quickly too.
    Farewell.
  Oph. O heavenly powers, restore 
him!
  Ham. I have heard of your paintings too, well enough. God hath
    given you one face, and 
you make yourselves another. You jig,
you
    amble, and you lisp; you nickname God's creatures an
d make
your
    wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't! it hath
made
    me mad. I 
say, we will have no more marriages. Those that are
    married already- all but one- shall live; t
he rest shall keep
as
    they are. To a nunnery, go.                            Exit.
  Oph. O, 
what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
    The courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword,

    Th' expectancy and rose of the fair state,
    The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
 
   Th' observ'd of all observers- quite, quite down!
    And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,

    That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
    Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
 
   Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
    That unmatch'd form and feature of blown yo
uth
    Blasted with ecstasy. O, woe is me
    T' have seen what I have seen, see what I see!

 
                  Enter King and Polonius.

  King. Love? his affections do not that way tend;
  
  Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,
    Was not like madness. There's something in
 his soul
    O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
    And I do doubt the hatch and the disclo
se
    Will be some danger; which for to prevent,
    I have in quick determination
    Thus set 
it down: he shall with speed to England
    For the demand of our neglected tribute.
    Haply the
 seas, and countries different,
    With variable objects, shall expel
    This something-settled 
matter in his heart,
    Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
    From fashion of himsel
f. What think you on't?
  Pol. It shall do well. But yet do I believe
    The origin and commencem
ent of his grief
    Sprung from neglected love.- How now, Ophelia?
    You need not tell us what 
Lord Hamlet said.
    We heard it all.- My lord, do as you please;
    But if you hold it fit, aft
er the play
    Let his queen mother all alone entreat him
    To show his grief. Let her be round
 with him;
    And I'll be plac'd so please you, in the ear
    Of all their conference. If she fi
nd him not,
    To England send him; or confine him where
    Your wisdom best shall think.
  Kin
g. It shall be so.
    Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.         Exeunt.




Scene 
II.
Elsinore. hall in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet and three of the Players.

  Ham. Speak the spe
ech, I pray you, as I pronounc'd it to you,
    trippingly on the tongue. But if you mouth it, as m
any of our
    players do, I had as live the town crier spoke my lines. Nor
do
    not saw the ai
r too much with your hand, thus, but use all
    gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and (as 
I may say)
    whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and beget a
    temperance that may giv
e it smoothness. O, it offends me to
the
    soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a
 passion
to
    tatters, to very rags, to split the cars of the groundlings,
who
    (for the mo
st part) are capable of nothing but inexplicable
dumb
    shows and noise. I would have such a fel
low whipp'd for
o'erdoing
    Termagant. It out-herods Herod. Pray you avoid it.
  Player. I warr
ant your honour.
  Ham. Be not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be
your
    tutor. S
uit the action to the word, the word to the action;
with
    this special observance, that you o'e
rstep not the modesty of
    nature: for anything so overdone is from the purpose of
playing,
   
 whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as
    'twere, the mirror up to nature;
 to show Virtue her own
feature,
    scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time
h
is
    form and pressure. Now this overdone, or come tardy off,
though
    it make the unskilful 
laugh, cannot but make the judicious
    grieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowanc
e
    o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that
I
    have seen play, and hea
rd others praise, and that highly (not
to
    speak it profanely), that, neither having the accent
 of
    Christians, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have
so
    strutted and bellowed 
that I have thought some of Nature's
    journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they
imi
tated
    humanity so abominably.
  Player. I hope we have reform'd that indifferently with us,
s
ir.
  Ham. O, reform it altogether! And let those that play your
clowns
    speak no more than is
 set down for them. For there be of them
    that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of
 barren
    spectators to laugh too, though in the mean time some
necessary
    question of the p
lay be then to be considered. That's
villanous
    and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool t
hat uses it.
Go
    make you ready.
                                                 Exeunt Playe
rs.

            Enter Polonius, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.

    How now, my lord? Will the 
King hear this piece of work?
  Pol. And the Queen too, and that presently.
  Ham. Bid the players
 make haste, [Exit Polonius.] Will you two
    help to hasten them?
  Both. We will, my lord.     
                  Exeunt they two.
  Ham. What, ho, Horatio!

                      Enter Horatio
.

  Hor. Here, sweet lord, at your service.
  Ham. Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
    As 
e'er my conversation cop'd withal.
  Hor. O, my dear lord!
  Ham. Nay, do not think I flatter;
  
  For what advancement may I hope from thee,
    That no revenue hast but thy good spirits
    To 
feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
    No, let the candied tongue lick absurd 
pomp,
    And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
    Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou
 hear?
    Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
    And could of men distinguish, her ele
ction
    Hath seal'd thee for herself. For thou hast been
    As one, in suff'ring all, that suff
ers nothing;
    A man that Fortune's buffets and rewards
    Hast ta'en with equal thanks; and bl
est are those
    Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled
    That they are not a pipe for
 Fortune's finger
    To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
    That is not passion's sl
ave, and I will wear him
    In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
    As I do thee. Somet
hing too much of this I
    There is a play to-night before the King.
    One scene of it comes ne
ar the circumstance,
    Which I have told thee, of my father's death.
    I prithee, when thou se
est that act afoot,
    Even with the very comment of thy soul
    Observe my uncle. If his occult
ed guilt
    Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
    It is a damned ghost that we have seen,
  
  And my imaginations are as foul
    As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
    For I mine ey
es will rivet to his face,
    And after we will both our judgments join
    In censure of his see
ming.
  Hor. Well, my lord.
    If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
    And scape 
detecting, I will pay the theft.

    Sound a flourish. [Enter Trumpets and Kettledrums. Danish
 
   march. [Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz,
      Guildenstern, and other Lords a
ttendant, with the Guard
                       carrying torches.

  Ham. They are coming to the 
play. I must be idle.
    Get you a place.
  King. How fares our cousin Hamlet?
  Ham. Excellent,
 i' faith; of the chameleon's dish. I eat the
air,
    promise-cramm'd. You cannot feed capons so.

  King. I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet. These words are
not
    mine.
  Ham. No, nor m
ine now. [To Polonius] My lord, you play'd once
    i' th' university, you say?
  Pol. That did I,
 my lord, and was accounted a good actor.
  Ham. What did you enact?
  Pol. I did enact Julius Cae
sar; I was kill'd i' th' Capitol;
Brutus
    kill'd me.
  Ham. It was a brute part of him to kill
 so capital a calf
there. Be
    the players ready.
  Ros. Ay, my lord. They stay upon your patie
nce.
  Queen. Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
  Ham. No, good mother. Here's metal more at
tractive.
  Pol. [to the King] O, ho! do you mark that?
  Ham. Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
   
                               [Sits down at Ophelia's feet.]

  Oph. No, my lord.
  Ham. I mean,
 my head upon your lap?
  Oph. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Do you think I meant country matters?
  Oph. I
 think nothing, my lord.
  Ham. That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
  Oph. What is, 
my lord?
  Ham. Nothing.
  Oph. You are merry, my lord.
  Ham. Who, I?
  Oph. Ay, my lord.
  Ha
m. O God, your only jig-maker! What should a man do but be
merry?
    For look you how cheerfully 
my mother looks, and my father
died
    within 's two hours.
  Oph. Nay 'tis twice two months, my
 lord.
  Ham. So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I'll have
a
    suit of sables. O 
heavens! die two months ago, and not
forgotten
    yet? Then there's hope a great man's memory may
 outlive his
life
    half a year. But, by'r Lady, he must build churches then; or
else
    shal
l he suffer not thinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose

    epitaph is 'For O, for O, the hobby-
horse is forgot!'

               Hautboys play. The dumb show enters.

    Enter a King and a Q
ueen very lovingly; the Queen embracing
    him and he her. She kneels, and makes show of protestat
ion
    unto him. He takes her up, and declines his head upon her
    neck. He lays him down upon 
a bank of flowers. She, seeing
    him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his
 
   crown, kisses it, pours poison in the sleeper's ears, and
    leaves him. The Queen returns, fin
ds the King dead, and makes
    passionate action. The Poisoner with some three or four
Mutes,
  
  comes in again, seem to condole with her. The dead body is
    carried away. The Poisoner wooes t
he Queen with gifts; she
    seems harsh and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts
    his love
.
                                                         Exeunt.

  Oph. What means this, my lo
rd?
  Ham. Marry, this is miching malhecho; it means mischief.
  Oph. Belike this show imports the
 argument of the play.

                      Enter Prologue.

  Ham. We shall know by this fell
ow. The players cannot keep
counsel;
    they'll tell all.
  Oph. Will he tell us what this show 
meant?
  Ham. Ay, or any show that you'll show him. Be not you asham'd
to
    show, he'll not sha
me to tell you what it means.
  Oph. You are naught, you are naught! I'll mark the play.

    Pro
. For us, and for our tragedy,
      Here stooping to your clemency,
      We beg your hearing pat
iently.                     [Exit.]

  Ham. Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
  Oph. 'Ti
s brief, my lord.
  Ham. As woman's love.

              Enter [two Players as] King and Queen.


    King. Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round
      Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' o
rbed ground,
      And thirty dozen moons with borrowed sheen
      About the world have times twe
lve thirties been,
      Since love our hearts, and Hymen did our hands,
      Unite comutual in m
ost sacred bands.
    Queen. So many journeys may the sun and moon
      Make us again count o'er 
ere love be done!
      But woe is me! you are so sick of late,
      So far from cheer and from y
our former state.
      That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
      Discomfort you, my lord
, it nothing must;
      For women's fear and love holds quantity,
      In neither aught, or in e
xtremity.
      Now what my love is, proof hath made you know;
      And as my love is siz'd, my f
ear is so.
      Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
      Where little fears grow 
great, great love grows there.
    King. Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;
      My
 operant powers their functions leave to do.
      And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,

      Honour'd, belov'd, and haply one as kind
      For husband shalt thou-
    Queen. O, confoun
d the rest!
      Such love must needs be treason in my breast.
      When second husband let me b
e accurst!
      None wed the second but who killed the first.

  Ham. [aside] Wormwood, wormwood
!

    Queen. The instances that second marriage move
      Are base respects of thrift, but none
 of love.
      A second time I kill my husband dead
      When second husband kisses me in bed.

    King. I do believe you think what now you speak;
      But what we do determine oft we break.

      Purpose is but the slave to memory,
      Of violent birth, but poor validity;
      Which n
ow, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree,
      But fall unshaken when they mellow be.
      Most
 necessary 'tis that we forget
      To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt.
      What to our
selves in passion we propose,
      The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
      The violence 
of either grief or joy
      Their own enactures with themselves destroy.
      Where joy most rev
els, grief doth most lament;
      Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
      This world 
is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
      That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
  
    For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
      Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love
.
      The great man down, you mark his favourite flies,
      The poor advanc'd makes friends of
 enemies;
      And hitherto doth love on fortune tend,
      For who not needs shall never lack a
 friend,
      And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
      Directly seasons him his enemy.
  
    But, orderly to end where I begun,
      Our wills and fates do so contrary run
      That our
 devices still are overthrown;
      Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own.
      So t
hink thou wilt no second husband wed;
      But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
    
Queen. Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light,
      Sport and repose lock from me day and nig
ht,
      To desperation turn my trust and hope,
      An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope,
 
     Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
      Meet what I would have well, and it destroy,

      Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
      If, once a widow, ever I be wife!

  Ha
m. If she should break it now!

    King. 'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile.
      M
y spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile
      The tedious day with sleep.
    Queen. Sleep r
ock thy brain,
                                                    [He] sleeps.
      And never co
me mischance between us twain!
Exit.

  Ham. Madam, how like you this play?
  Queen. The lady do
th protest too much, methinks.
  Ham. O, but she'll keep her word.
  King. Have you heard the argu
ment? Is there no offence in't?
  Ham. No, no! They do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i'
th'

    world.
  King. What do you call the play?
  Ham. 'The Mousetrap.' Marry, how? Tropically. Th
is play is the
    image of a murther done in Vienna. Gonzago is the duke's
name;
    his wife, B
aptista. You shall see anon. 'Tis a knavish piece
of
    work; but what o' that? Your Majesty, and
 we that have free
    souls, it touches us not. Let the gall'd jade winch; our
withers
    are u
nwrung.

                         Enter Lucianus.

    This is one Lucianus, nephew to the King.

  Oph. You are as good as a chorus, my lord.
  Ham. I could interpret between you and your love, 
if I could
see
    the puppets dallying.
  Oph. You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
  Ham. It w
ould cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
  Oph. Still better, and worse.
  Ham. So you must t
ake your husbands.- Begin, murtherer. Pox,
leave
    thy damnable faces, and begin! Come, the croa
king raven doth
    bellow for revenge.

    Luc. Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time 
agreeing;
      Confederate season, else no creature seeing;
      Thou mixture rank, of midnight 
weeds collected,
      With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,
      Thy natural magic 
and dire property
      On wholesome life usurp immediately.
                                   Po
urs the poison in his ears.

  Ham. He poisons him i' th' garden for's estate. His name's
Gonzago
.
    The story is extant, and written in very choice Italian. You
    shall see anon how the murt
herer gets the love of Gonzago's
wife.
  Oph. The King rises.
  Ham. What, frighted with false fi
re?
  Queen. How fares my lord?
  Pol. Give o'er the play.
  King. Give me some light! Away!
  A
ll. Lights, lights, lights!
                              Exeunt all but Hamlet and Horatio.
  Ham
.   Why, let the strucken deer go weep,
          The hart ungalled play;
         For some must w
atch, while some must sleep:
          Thus runs the world away.
    Would not this, sir, and a fo
rest of feathers- if the rest of
my
    fortunes turn Turk with me-with two Provincial roses on my

raz'd
    shoes, get me a fellowship in a cry of players, sir?
  Hor. Half a share.
  Ham.   A 
whole one I!
         For thou dost know, O Damon dear,
           This realm dismantled was
    
     Of Jove himself; and now reigns here
           A very, very- pajock.
  Hor. You might have r
hym'd.
  Ham. O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand
    pound! Didst perceive?

  Hor. Very well, my lord.
  Ham. Upon the talk of the poisoning?
  Hor. I did very well note hi
m.
  Ham.   Aha! Come, some music! Come, the recorders!
         For if the King like not the come
dy,
         Why then, belike he likes it not, perdy.
    Come, some music!

                Ent
er Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Guil. Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.
  Ham. Sir,
 a whole history.
  Guil. The King, sir-
  Ham. Ay, sir, what of him?
  Guil. Is in his retiremen
t, marvellous distemper'd.
  Ham. With drink, sir?
  Guil. No, my lord; rather with choler.
  Ham
. Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this
to
    the doctor; for me to put him 
to his purgation would perhaps
    plunge him into far more choler.
  Guil. Good my lord, put your
 discourse into some frame, and
start
    not so wildly from my affair.
  Ham. I am tame, sir; pr
onounce.
  Guil. The Queen, your mother, in most great affliction of
spirit
    hath sent me to y
ou.
  Ham. You are welcome.
  Guil. Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right
breed.

    If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, I will
do
    your mother's commandment;
 if not, your pardon and my return
    shall be the end of my business.
  Ham. Sir, I cannot.
  G
uil. What, my lord?
  Ham. Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseas'd. But, sir,
such
    ans
wer as I can make, you shall command; or rather, as you
say,
    my mother. Therefore no more, but
 to the matter! My mother,
you
    say-
  Ros. Then thus she says: your behaviour hath struck her
 into
    amazement and admiration.
  Ham. O wonderful son, that can so stonish a mother! But is

there no
    sequel at the heels of this mother's admiration? Impart.
  Ros. She desires to speak 
with you in her closet ere you go to
bed.
  Ham. We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Hav
e you any
    further trade with us?
  Ros. My lord, you once did love me.
  Ham. And do still, b
y these pickers and stealers!
  Ros. Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? You do
surely

    bar the door upon your own liberty, if you deny your griefs
to
    your friend.
  Ham. Sir, 
I lack advancement.
  Ros. How can that be, when you have the voice of the King
himself
    for y
our succession in Denmark?
  Ham. Ay, sir, but 'while the grass grows'- the proverb is
something

    musty.

                     Enter the Players with recorders.

    O, the recorders! Let me
 see one. To withdraw with you- why
do
    you go about to recover the wind of me, as if you would
 drive
me
    into a toil?
  Guil. O my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too
unmannerly.

  Ham. I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this
pipe?
  Guil. My lord, I cannot.

  Ham. I pray you.
  Guil. Believe me, I cannot.
  Ham. I do beseech you.
  Guil. I know, no touc
h of it, my lord.
  Ham. It is as easy as lying. Govern these ventages with your
    fingers and t
humbs, give it breath with your mouth, and it
will
    discourse most eloquent music. Look you, th
ese are the stops.
  Guil. But these cannot I command to any utt'rance of harmony. I
    have not 
the skill.
  Ham. Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me!
You
    would play upon
 me; you would seem to know my stops; you
would
    pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would s
ound me from my
    lowest note to the top of my compass; and there is much
music,
    excellent 
voice, in this little organ, yet cannot you make it
    speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am easier to
 be play'd on than
a
    pipe? Call me what instrument you will, though you can fret
me,
    you
 cannot play upon me.

                        Enter Polonius.

    God bless you, sir!
  Pol. 
My lord, the Queen would speak with you, and presently.
  Ham. Do you see yonder cloud that's almos
t in shape of a camel?
  Pol. By th' mass, and 'tis like a camel indeed.
  Ham. Methinks it is lik
e a weasel.
  Pol. It is back'd like a weasel.
  Ham. Or like a whale.
  Pol. Very like a whale.

  Ham. Then will I come to my mother by-and-by.- They fool me to
the
    top of my bent.- I will 
come by-and-by.
  Pol. I will say so.                                      Exit.
  Ham. 'By-and-by
' is easily said.- Leave me, friends.
                                        [Exeunt all but Hamle
t.]

    'Tis now the very witching time of night,
    When churchyards yawn, and hell itself bre
athes out
    Contagion to this world. Now could I drink hot blood
    And do such bitter business
 as the day
    Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother!
    O heart, lose not thy nature; 
let not ever
    The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom.
    Let me be cruel, not unnatural;
    
I will speak daggers to her, but use none.
    My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites-
    How i
n my words somever she be shent,
    To give them seals never, my soul, consent!             Exit.





Scene III.
A room in the Castle.

Enter King, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.

  King. 
I like him not, nor stands it safe with us
    To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;
  
  I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
    And he to England shall along with you.
    The t
erms of our estate may not endure
    Hazard so near us as doth hourly grow
    Out of his lunacie
s.
  Guil. We will ourselves provide.
    Most holy and religious fear it is
    To keep those ma
ny many bodies safe
    That live and feed upon your Majesty.
  Ros. The single and peculiar life 
is bound
    With all the strength and armour of the mind
    To keep itself from noyance; but muc
h more
    That spirit upon whose weal depends and rests
    The lives of many. The cesse of majes
ty
    Dies not alone, but like a gulf doth draw
    What's near it with it. It is a massy wheel,

    Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,
    To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things

    Are mortis'd and adjoin'd; which when it falls,
    Each small annexment, petty consequence,

    Attends the boist'rous ruin. Never alone
    Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.
  Ki
ng. Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;
    For we will fetters put upon this fear,
    Wh
ich now goes too free-footed.
  Both. We will haste us.
                                          
     Exeunt Gentlemen.

                   Enter Polonius.

  Pol. My lord, he's going to his mo
ther's closet.
    Behind the arras I'll convey myself
    To hear the process. I'll warrant she'l
l tax him home;
    And, as you said, and wisely was it said,
    'Tis meet that some more audienc
e than a mother,
    Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear
    The speech, of vantage. 
Fare you well, my liege.
    I'll call upon you ere you go to bed
    And tell you what I know.
 
 King. Thanks, dear my lord.
                                                Exit [Polonius].
    
O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven;
    It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,
    A brot
her's murther! Pray can I not,
    Though inclination be as sharp as will.
    My stronger guilt d
efeats my strong intent,
    And, like a man to double business bound,
    I stand in pause where 
I shall first begin,
    And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
    Were thicker than itself w
ith brother's blood,
    Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
    To wash it white as sno
w? Whereto serves mercy
    But to confront the visage of offence?
    And what's in prayer but th
is twofold force,
    To be forestalled ere we come to fall,
    Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll
 look up;
    My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer
    Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my 
foul murther'?
    That cannot be; since I am still possess'd
    Of those effects for which I did
 the murther-
    My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.
    May one be pardon'd and retain th
' offence?
    In the corrupted currents of this world
    Offence's gilded hand may shove by just
ice,
    And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
    Buys out the law; but 'tis not so above.
 
   There is no shuffling; there the action lies
    In his true nature, and we ourselves compell'd,

    Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
    To give in evidence. What then? What rests?

    Try what repentance can. What can it not?
    Yet what can it when one cannot repent?
    O 
wretched state! O bosom black as death!
    O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
    Art mor
e engag'd! Help, angels! Make assay.
    Bow, stubborn knees; and heart with strings of steel,
   
 Be soft as sinews of the new-born babe!
    All may be well.                                  He k
neels.

                         Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;

    And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven,
    And so am I reveng'd. That would be scann'd.

    A villain kills my father; and for that,
    I, his sole son, do this same villain send
    
To heaven.
    Why, this is hire and salary, not revenge!
    He took my father grossly, full of b
read,
    With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
    And how his audit stands, who know
s save heaven?
    But in our circumstance and course of thought,
    'Tis heavy with him; and am 
I then reveng'd,
    To take him in the purging of his soul,
    When he is fit and seasoned for h
is passage?
    No.
    Up, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent.
    When he is drunk asleep;
 or in his rage;
    Or in th' incestuous pleasure of his bed;
    At gaming, swearing, or about s
ome act
    That has no relish of salvation in't-
    Then trip him, that his heels may kick at he
aven,
    And that his soul may be as damn'd and black
    As hell, whereto it goes. My mother sta
ys.
    This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.              Exit.
  King. [rises] My words fly 
up, my thoughts remain below.
    Words without thoughts never to heaven go.             Exit.





Scene IV.
The Queen's closet.

Enter Queen and Polonius.

  Pol. He will come straight. Lo
ok you lay home to him.
    Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,
    And that you
r Grace hath screen'd and stood between
    Much heat and him. I'll silence me even here.
    Pray
 you be round with him.
  Ham. (within) Mother, mother, mother!
  Queen. I'll warrant you; fear me
 not. Withdraw; I hear him
coming.
                              [Polonius hides behind the arras.
]

                          Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Now, mother, what's the matter?
  Queen. Ham
let, thou hast thy father much offended.
  Ham. Mother, you have my father much offended.
  Queen.
 Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
  Ham. Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
  Q
ueen. Why, how now, Hamlet?
  Ham. What's the matter now?
  Queen. Have you forgot me?
  Ham. No,
 by the rood, not so!
    You are the Queen, your husband's brother's wife,
    And (would it were
 not so!) you are my mother.
  Queen. Nay, then I'll set those to you that can speak.
  Ham. Come,
 come, and sit you down. You shall not budge;
    You go not till I set you up a glass
    Where y
ou may see the inmost part of you.
  Queen. What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murther me?
    Help,
 help, ho!
  Pol. [behind] What, ho! help, help, help!
  Ham. [draws] How now? a rat? Dead for a d
ucat, dead!
            [Makes a pass through the arras and] kills Polonius.
  Pol. [behind] O, I 
am slain!
  Queen. O me, what hast thou done?
  Ham. Nay, I know not. Is it the King?
  Queen. O,
 what a rash and bloody deed is this!
  Ham. A bloody deed- almost as bad, good mother,
    As kil
l a king, and marry with his brother.
  Queen. As kill a king?
  Ham. Ay, lady, it was my word.
 
                        [Lifts up the arras and sees Polonius.]
    Thou wretched, rash, intruding 
fool, farewell!
    I took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune.
    Thou find'st to be too busy 
is some danger.
    Leave wringing of your hands. Peace! sit you down
    And let me wring your he
art; for so I shall
    If it be made of penetrable stuff;
    If damned custom have not braz'd it
 so
    That it is proof and bulwark against sense.
  Queen. What have I done that thou dar'st wag
 thy tongue
    In noise so rude against me?
  Ham. Such an act
    That blurs the grace and blus
h of modesty;
    Calls virtue hypocrite; takes off the rose
    From the fair forehead of an inno
cent love,
    And sets a blister there; makes marriage vows
    As false as dicers' oaths. O, suc
h a deed
    As from the body of contraction plucks
    The very soul, and sweet religion makes
 
   A rhapsody of words! Heaven's face doth glow;
    Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
    Wit
h tristful visage, as against the doom,
    Is thought-sick at the act.
  Queen. Ah me, what act,

    That roars so loud and thunders in the index?
  Ham. Look here upon th's picture, and on this,

    The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
    See what a grace was seated on this brow;
 
   Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
    An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
   
 A station like the herald Mercury
    New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill:
    A combination and
 a form indeed
    Where every god did seem to set his seal
    To give the world assurance of a m
an.
    This was your husband. Look you now what follows.
    Here is your husband, like a mildew'
d ear
    Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
    Could you on this fair mountain leave
 to feed,
    And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes
    You cannot call it love; for at your 
age
    The heyday in the blood is tame, it's humble,
    And waits upon the judgment; and what ju
dgment
    Would step from this to this? Sense sure you have,
    Else could you not have motion; 
but sure that sense
    Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,
    Nor sense to ecstacy was ne'e
r so thrall'd
    But it reserv'd some quantity of choice
    To serve in such a difference. What 
devil was't
    That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
    Eyes without feeling, feeling wit
hout sight,
    Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
    Or but a sickly part of one tru
e sense
    Could not so mope.
    O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
    If thou cans
t mutine in a matron's bones,
    To flaming youth let virtue be as wax
    And melt in her own fi
re. Proclaim no shame
    When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
    Since frost itself as a
ctively doth burn,
    And reason panders will.
  Queen. O Hamlet, speak no more!
    Thou turn's
t mine eyes into my very soul,
    And there I see such black and grained spots
    As will not le
ave their tinct.
  Ham. Nay, but to live
    In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
    Stew'd in 
corruption, honeying and making love
    Over the nasty sty!
  Queen. O, speak to me no more!
   
 These words like daggers enter in mine ears.
    No more, sweet Hamlet!
  Ham. A murtherer and a 
villain!
    A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
    Of your precedent lord; a vice of ki
ngs;
    A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
    That from a shelf the precious diadem stole
 
   And put it in his pocket!
  Queen. No more!

                Enter the Ghost in his nightgown.


  Ham. A king of shreds and patches!-
    Save me and hover o'er me with your wings,
    You h
eavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?
  Queen. Alas, he's mad!
  Ham. Do you not come y
our tardy son to chide,
    That, laps'd in time and passion, lets go by
    Th' important acting 
of your dread command?
    O, say!
  Ghost. Do not forget. This visitation
    Is but to whet thy
 almost blunted purpose.
    But look, amazement on thy mother sits.
    O, step between her and h
er fighting soul
    Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works.
    Speak to her, Hamlet.
  Ham. 
How is it with you, lady?
  Queen. Alas, how is't with you,
    That you do bend your eye on vacan
cy,
    And with th' encorporal air do hold discourse?
    Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly 
peep;
    And, as the sleeping soldiers in th' alarm,
    Your bedded hairs, like life in excremen
ts,
    Start up and stand an end. O gentle son,
    Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
   
 Sprinkle cool patience! Whereon do you look?
  Ham. On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!

    His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
    Would make them capable.- Do not look up
on me,
    Lest with this piteous action you convert
    My stern effects. Then what I have to do

    Will want true colour- tears perchance for blood.
  Queen. To whom do you speak this?
  Ham. 
Do you see nothing there?
  Queen. Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
  Ham. Nor did you nothi
ng hear?
  Queen. No, nothing but ourselves.
  Ham. Why, look you there! Look how it steals away!

    My father, in his habit as he liv'd!
    Look where he goes even now out at the portal!
     
                                                Exit Ghost.
  Queen. This is the very coinage of yo
ur brain.
    This bodiless creation ecstasy
    Is very cunning in.
  Ham. Ecstasy?
    My puls
e as yours doth temperately keep time
    And makes as healthful music. It is not madness
    That
 I have utt'red. Bring me to the test,
    And I the matter will reword; which madness
    Would g
ambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
    Lay not that flattering unction to your soul
    That n
ot your trespass but my madness speaks.
    It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
    Whil
es rank corruption, mining all within,
    Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
    Repent 
what's past; avoid what is to come;
    And do not spread the compost on the weeds
    To make the
m ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;
    For in the fatness of these pursy times
    Virtue itself
 of vice must pardon beg-
    Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.
  Queen. O Hamlet, thou 
hast cleft my heart in twain.
  Ham. O, throw away the worser part of it,
    And live the purer w
ith the other half,
    Good night- but go not to my uncle's bed.
    Assume a virtue, if you have
 it not.
    That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat
    Of habits evil, is angel yet in this
,
    That to the use of actions fair and good
    He likewise gives a frock or livery,
    That 
aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,
    And that shall lend a kind of easiness
    To the next abst
inence; the next more easy;
    For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
    And either [mas
ter] the devil, or throw him out
    With wondrous potency. Once more, good night;
    And when yo
u are desirous to be blest,
    I'll blessing beg of you.- For this same lord,
    I do repent; bu
t heaven hath pleas'd it so,
    To punish me with this, and this with me,
    That I must be thei
r scourge and minister.
    I will bestow him, and will answer well
    The death I gave him. So a
gain, good night.
    I must be cruel, only to be kind;
    Thus bad begins, and worse remains beh
ind.
    One word more, good lady.
  Queen. What shall I do?
  Ham. Not this, by no means, that I
 bid you do:
    Let the bloat King tempt you again to bed;
    Pinch wanton on your cheek; call y
ou his mouse;
    And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
    Or paddling in your neck with his 
damn'd fingers,
    Make you to ravel all this matter out,
    That I essentially am not in madnes
s,
    But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;
    For who that's but a queen, fair, sober
, wise,
    Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib
    Such dear concernings hide? Who would do s
o?
    No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
    Unpeg the basket on the house's top,
    Let the 
birds fly, and like the famous ape,
    To try conclusions, in the basket creep
    And break your
 own neck down.
  Queen. Be thou assur'd, if words be made of breath,
    And breath of life, I ha
ve no life to breathe
    What thou hast said to me.
  Ham. I must to England; you know that?
  Q
ueen. Alack,
    I had forgot! 'Tis so concluded on.
  Ham. There's letters seal'd; and my two sch
oolfellows,
    Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,
    They bear the mandate; they must sw
eep my way
    And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
    For 'tis the sport to have the enginer

    Hoist with his own petar; and 't shall go hard
    But I will delve one yard below their mines

    And blow them at the moon. O, 'tis most sweet
    When in one line two crafts directly meet.

    This man shall set me packing.
    I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.-
    Mother, go
od night.- Indeed, this counsellor
    Is now most still, most secret, and most grave,
    Who was
 in life a foolish peating knave.
    Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.
    Good night, m
other.
                  [Exit the Queen. Then] Exit Hamlet, tugging in
                          
                             Polonius.

ACT IV. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in th
e Castle.

Enter King and Queen, with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  King. There's matter in t
hese sighs. These profound heaves
    You must translate; 'tis fit we understand them.
    Where i
s your son?
  Queen. Bestow this place on us a little while.
                          [Exeunt Ros
encrantz and Guildenstern.]
    Ah, mine own lord, what have I seen to-night!
  King. What, Gertru
de? How does Hamlet?
  Queen. Mad as the sea and wind when both contend
    Which is the mightier.
 In his lawless fit
    Behind the arras hearing something stir,
    Whips out his rapier, cries '
A rat, a rat!'
    And in this brainish apprehension kills
    The unseen good old man.
  King. O
 heavy deed!
    It had been so with us, had we been there.
    His liberty is full of threats to 
all-
    To you yourself, to us, to every one.
    Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?

    It will be laid to us, whose providence
    Should have kept short, restrain'd, and out of haun
t
    This mad young man. But so much was our love
    We would not understand what was most fit,

    But, like the owner of a foul disease,
    To keep it from divulging, let it feed
    Even on
 the pith of life. Where is he gone?
  Queen. To draw apart the body he hath kill'd;
    O'er whom
 his very madness, like some ore
    Among a mineral of metals base,
    Shows itself pure. He wee
ps for what is done.
  King. O Gertrude, come away!
    The sun no sooner shall the mountains touc
h
    But we will ship him hence; and this vile deed
    We must with all our majesty and skill
 
   Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!

             Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
.

    Friends both, go join you with some further aid.
    Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain
,
    And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him.
    Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring
 the body
    Into the chapel. I pray you haste in this.
                          Exeunt [Rosencr
antz and Guildenstern].
    Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends
    And let them know
 both what we mean to do
    And what's untimely done. [So haply slander-]
    Whose whisper o'er 
the world's diameter,
    As level as the cannon to his blank,
    Transports his poisoned shot- m
ay miss our name
    And hit the woundless air.- O, come away!
    My soul is full of discord and 
dismay.
                                                         Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsino
re. A passage in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Safely stow'd.
  Gentlemen. (within) Hamlet
! Lord Hamlet!
  Ham. But soft! What noise? Who calls on Hamlet? O, here they
come.

           
    Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Ros. What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?

  Ham. Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
  Ros. Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it th
ence
    And bear it to the chapel.
  Ham. Do not believe it.
  Ros. Believe what?
  Ham. That I
 can keep your counsel, and not mine own. Besides,
to be
    demanded of a sponge, what replicatio
n should be made by the
son
    of a king?
  Ros. Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
  Ham. Ay, 
sir; that soaks up the King's countenance, his
rewards,
    his authorities. But such officers do 
the King best service
in
    the end. He keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his
jaw;
    
first mouth'd, to be last swallowed. When he needs what you
have
    glean'd, it is but squeezing 
you and, sponge, you shall be
dry
    again.
  Ros. I understand you not, my lord.
  Ham. I am g
lad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.
  Ros. My lord, you must tell us where the bod
y is and go with us
to
    the King.
  Ham. The body is with the King, but the King is not with t
he
body.
    The King is a thing-
  Guil. A thing, my lord?
  Ham. Of nothing. Bring me to him. 
Hide fox, and all after.
                                                         Exeunt.





Scene III.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King.

  King. I have sent to seek him and to
 find the body.
    How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
    Yet must not we put the stro
ng law on him.
    He's lov'd of the distracted multitude,
    Who like not in their judgment, but
 their eyes;
    And where 'tis so, th' offender's scourge is weigh'd,
    But never the offence. 
To bear all smooth and even,
    This sudden sending him away must seem
    Deliberate pause. Dise
ases desperate grown
    By desperate appliance are reliev'd,
    Or not at all.

              
      Enter Rosencrantz.

    How now O What hath befall'n?
  Ros. Where the dead body is bestow'
d, my lord,
    We cannot get from him.
  King. But where is he?
  Ros. Without, my lord; guarded
, to know your pleasure.
  King. Bring him before us.
  Ros. Ho, Guildenstern! Bring in my lord.


        Enter Hamlet and Guildenstern [with Attendants].

  King. Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?

  Ham. At supper.
  King. At supper? Where?
  Ham. Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A c
ertain
    convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your worm is
your
    only emperor for d
iet. We fat all creatures else to fat us,
and
    we fat ourselves for maggots. Your fat king and 
your lean
beggar
    is but variable service- two dishes, but to one table. That's
the
    end.

  King. Alas, alas!
  Ham. A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and
eat
    of 
the fish that hath fed of that worm.
  King. What dost thou mean by this?
  Ham. Nothing but to sh
ow you how a king may go a progress
through
    the guts of a beggar.
  King. Where is Polonius?

  Ham. In heaven. Send thither to see. If your messenger find him
not
    there, seek him i' th' 
other place yourself. But indeed, if
you
    find him not within this month, you shall nose him as
 you go
up
    the stair, into the lobby.
  King. Go seek him there. [To Attendants.]
  Ham. He 
will stay till you come.
                                            [Exeunt Attendants.]
  King. 
Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,-
    Which we do tender as we dearly grieve
    For 
that which thou hast done,- must send thee hence
    With fiery quickness. Therefore prepare thysel
f.
    The bark is ready and the wind at help,
    Th' associates tend, and everything is bent
  
  For England.
  Ham. For England?
  King. Ay, Hamlet.
  Ham. Good.
  King. So is it, if thou kn
ew'st our purposes.
  Ham. I see a cherub that sees them. But come, for England!
    Farewell, dea
r mother.
  King. Thy loving father, Hamlet.
  Ham. My mother! Father and mother is man and wife; 
man and wife
is
    one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England!
Exit.
  King. Follow him at
 foot; tempt him with speed aboard.
    Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night.
    Away! for 
everything is seal'd and done
    That else leans on th' affair. Pray you make haste.
            
                Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]
    And, England, if my love thou hold'st at a
ught,-
    As my great power thereof may give thee sense,
    Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw an
d red
    After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
    Pays homage to us,- thou mayst not coldly s
et
    Our sovereign process, which imports at full,
    By letters congruing to that effect,
   
 The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;
    For like the hectic in my blood he rages,
    An
d thou must cure me. Till I know 'tis done,
    Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.         
    Exit.

Scene IV.
Near Elsinore.

Enter Fortinbras with his Army over the 
stage.

  For. Go, Captain, from me greet the Danish king.
    Tell him that by his license Forti
nbras
    Craves the conveyance of a promis'd march
    Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.

    If that his Majesty would aught with us,
    We shall express our duty in his eye;
    And l
et him know so.
  Capt. I will do't, my lord.
  For. Go softly on.
                              
     Exeunt [all but the Captain].

       Enter Hamlet, Rosencrantz, [Guildenstern,] and others.


  Ham. Good sir, whose powers are these?
  Capt. They are of Norway, sir.
  Ham. How purpos'd, 
sir, I pray you?
  Capt. Against some part of Poland.
  Ham. Who commands them, sir?
  Capt. The 
nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.
  Ham. Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
    Or for some 
frontier?
  Capt. Truly to speak, and with no addition,
    We go to gain a little patch of ground

    That hath in it no profit but the name.
    To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
 
   Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
    A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
  Ham. Why
, then the Polack never will defend it.
  Capt. Yes, it is already garrison'd.
  Ham. Two thousand
 souls and twenty thousand ducats
    Will not debate the question of this straw.
    This is th' 
imposthume of much wealth and peace,
    That inward breaks, and shows no cause without
    Why th
e man dies.- I humbly thank you, sir.
  Capt. God b' wi' you, sir.                             [Exi
t.]
  Ros. Will't please you go, my lord?
  Ham. I'll be with you straight. Go a little before.
 
                                       [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]
    How all occasions do inform aga
inst me
    And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
    If his chief good and market of his time

    Be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.
    Sure he that made us with such large discourse
,
    Looking before and after, gave us not
    That capability and godlike reason
    To fust in
 us unus'd. Now, whether it be
    Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple
    Of thinking too pr
ecisely on th' event,-
    A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
    And ever three
 parts coward,- I do not know
    Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do,'
    Sith I have caus
e, and will, and strength, and means
    To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me.
    Witness t
his army of such mass and charge,
    Led by a delicate and tender prince,
    Whose spirit, with 
divine ambition puff'd,
    Makes mouths at the invisible event,
    Exposing what is mortal and u
nsure
    To all that fortune, death, and danger dare,
    Even for an eggshell. Rightly to be gre
at
    Is not to stir without great argument,
    But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
    When
 honour's at the stake. How stand I then,
    That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,
    Exc
itements of my reason and my blood,
    And let all sleep, while to my shame I see
    The imminen
t death of twenty thousand men
    That for a fantasy and trick of fame
    Go to their graves lik
e beds, fight for a plot
    Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
    Which is not tomb enoug
h and continent
    To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,
    My thoughts be bloody, or be n
othing worth!            Exit.

Scene V.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Ent
er Horatio, Queen, and a Gentleman.

  Queen. I will not speak with her.
  Gent. She is importuna
te, indeed distract.
    Her mood will needs be pitied.
  Queen. What would she have?
  Gent. She
 speaks much of her father; says she hears
    There's tricks i' th' world, and hems, and beats her
 heart;
    Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,
    That carry but half sense. Her
 speech is nothing,
    Yet the unshaped use of it doth move
    The hearers to collection; they a
im at it,
    And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;
    Which, as her winks and nods a
nd gestures yield them,
    Indeed would make one think there might be thought,
    Though nothing
 sure, yet much unhappily.
  Hor. 'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew
    Dangerou
s conjectures in ill-breeding minds.
  Queen. Let her come in.
                                   
            [Exit Gentleman.]
    [Aside] To my sick soul (as sin's true nature is)
    Each toy s
eems Prologue to some great amiss.
    So full of artless jealousy is guilt
    It spills itself i
n fearing to be spilt.

                 Enter Ophelia distracted.

  Oph. Where is the beauteou
s Majesty of Denmark?
  Queen. How now, Ophelia?
  Oph. (sings)
         How should I your true-l
ove know
           From another one?
         By his cockle bat and' staff
           And his sa
ndal shoon.

  Queen. Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
  Oph. Say you? Nay, pray You mar
k.

    (Sings) He is dead and gone, lady,
              He is dead and gone;
            At his
 head a grass-green turf,
              At his heels a stone.

    O, ho!
  Queen. Nay, but Ophe
lia-
  Oph. Pray you mark.

    (Sings) White his shroud as the mountain snow-

               
     Enter King.

  Queen. Alas, look here, my lord!
  Oph. (Sings)
           Larded all with s
weet flowers;
         Which bewept to the grave did not go
           With true-love showers.


  King. How do you, pretty lady?
  Oph. Well, God dild you! They say the owl was a baker's
daughte
r.
    Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be. God
be at
    your table!
  King.
 Conceit upon her father.
  Oph. Pray let's have no words of this; but when they ask, you
what
  
  it means, say you this:

    (Sings) To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,
              All in t
he morning bedtime,
            And I a maid at your window,
              To be your Valentine.


            Then up he rose and donn'd his clo'es
              And dupp'd the chamber door,
   
         Let in the maid, that out a maid
              Never departed more.

  King. Pretty Ophe
lia!
  Oph. Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't!

    [Sings] By Gis and by Saint 
Charity,
              Alack, and fie for shame!
            Young men will do't if they come to't

              By Cock, they are to blame.

            Quoth she, 'Before you tumbled me,
     
         You promis'd me to wed.'

    He answers:

            'So would I 'a' done, by yonder 
sun,
              An thou hadst not come to my bed.'

  King. How long hath she been thus?
  Op
h. I hope all will be well. We must be patient; but I cannot
    choose but weep to think they woul
d lay him i' th' cold
ground.
    My brother shall know of it; and so I thank you for your good
 
   counsel. Come, my coach! Good night, ladies. Good night,
sweet
    ladies. Good night, good nig
ht.                         Exit
  King. Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.
      
                                           [Exit Horatio.]

    O, this is the poison of deep grie
f; it springs
    All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
    When sorrows come, they c
ome not single spies.
    But in battalions! First, her father slain;
    Next, your son gone, and
 he most violent author
    Of his own just remove; the people muddied,
    Thick and and unwholes
ome in their thoughts and whispers
    For good Polonius' death, and we have done but greenly
    
In hugger-mugger to inter him; poor Ophelia
    Divided from herself and her fair judgment,
    Wi
thout the which we are pictures or mere beasts;
    Last, and as much containing as all these,
   
 Her brother is in secret come from France;
    And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
    Feeds 
on his wonder, keep, himself in clouds,
    With pestilent speeches of his father's death,
    Whe
rein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
    Will nothing stick our person to arraign
    In ear and ea
r. O my dear Gertrude, this,
    Like to a murd'ring piece, in many places
    Give me superfluous
 death.                  A noise within.
  Queen. Alack, what noise is this?
  King. Where are my 
Switzers? Let them guard the door.

                     Enter a Messenger.

    What is the mat
ter?
  Mess. Save Yourself, my lord:
    The ocean, overpeering of his list,
    Eats not the fla
ts with more impetuous haste
    Than Young Laertes, in a riotous head,
    O'erbears Your offices
. The rabble call him lord;
    And, as the world were now but to begin,
    Antiquity forgot, cus
tom not known,
    The ratifiers and props of every word,
    They cry 'Choose we! Laertes shall b
e king!'
    Caps, hands, and tongues applaud it to the clouds,
    'Laertes shall be king! Laerte
s king!'
                                                 A noise within.
  Queen. How cheerfully 
on the false trail they cry!
    O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!
  King. The doors are 
broke.

                    Enter Laertes with others.

  Laer. Where is this king?- Sirs, staid
 you all without.
  All. No, let's come in!
  Laer. I pray you give me leave.
  All. We will, we 
will!
  Laer. I thank you. Keep the door.      [Exeunt his Followers.]
    O thou vile king,
    
Give me my father!
  Queen. Calmly, good Laertes.
  Laer. That drop of blood that's calm proclaims
 me bastard;
    Cries cuckold to my father; brands the harlot
    Even here between the chaste un
smirched brows
    Of my true mother.
  King. What is the cause, Laertes,
    That thy rebellion 
looks so giantlike?
    Let him go, Gertrude. Do not fear our person.
    There's such divinity do
th hedge a king
    That treason can but peep to what it would,
    Acts little of his will. Tell 
me, Laertes,
    Why thou art thus incens'd. Let him go, Gertrude.
    Speak, man.
  Laer. Where 
is my father?
  King. Dead.
  Queen. But not by him!
  King. Let him demand his fill.
  Laer. Ho
w came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
    To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil
   
 Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
    I dare damnation. To this point I stand,
    Th
at both the world, I give to negligence,
    Let come what comes; only I'll be reveng'd
    Most t
hroughly for my father.
  King. Who shall stay you?
  Laer. My will, not all the world!
    And f
or my means, I'll husband them so well
    They shall go far with little.
  King. Good Laertes,
 
   If you desire to know the certainty
    Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge

    That sweepstake you will draw both friend and foe,
    Winner and loser?
  Laer. None but his 
enemies.
  King. Will you know them then?
  Laer. To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms

    And, like the kind life-rend'ring pelican,
    Repast them with my blood.
  King. Why, now You
 speak
    Like a good child and a true gentleman.
    That I am guiltless of your father's death,

    And am most sensibly in grief for it,
    It shall as level to your judgment pierce
    As d
ay does to your eye.
                              A noise within: 'Let her come in.'
  Laer. How 
now? What noise is that?

                      Enter Ophelia.

    O heat, dry up my brains! Te
ars seven times salt
    Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!
    By heaven, thy madness sha
ll be paid by weight
    Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!
    Dear maid, kind sister, 
sweet Ophelia!
    O heavens! is't possible a young maid's wits
    Should be as mortal as an old 
man's life?
    Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,
    It sends some precious instance o
f itself
    After the thing it loves.

  Oph. (sings)
         They bore him barefac'd on the b
ier
           (Hey non nony, nony, hey nony)
         And in his grave rain'd many a tear.

   
 Fare you well, my dove!
  Laer. Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
    It could not
 move thus.
  Oph. You must sing 'A-down a-down, and you call him a-down-a.'
O,
    how the wheel
 becomes it! It is the false steward, that stole
his
    master's daughter.
  Laer. This nothing'
s more than matter.
  Oph. There's rosemary, that's for remembrance. Pray you, love,
    remember.
 And there is pansies, that's for thoughts.
  Laer. A document in madness! Thoughts and remembrance
 fitted.
  Oph. There's fennel for you, and columbines. There's rue for
you,
    and here's some 
for me. We may call it herb of grace o'
Sundays.
    O, you must wear your rue with a difference! 
There's a daisy.
I
    would give you some violets, but they wither'd all when my
father
    die
d. They say he made a good end.

    [Sings] For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.

  Laer. Thoug
ht and affliction, passion, hell itself,
    She turns to favour and to prettiness.
  Oph. (sings)

         And will he not come again?
         And will he not come again?
           No, no, he 
is dead;
           Go to thy deathbed;
         He never will come again.

         His beard w
as as white as snow,
         All flaxen was his poll.
           He is gone, he is gone,
       
    And we cast away moan.
         God 'a'mercy on his soul!

    And of all Christian souls, I 
pray God. God b' wi' you.
Exit.
  Laer. Do you see this, O God?
  King. Laertes, I must commune w
ith your grief,
    Or you deny me right. Go but apart,
    Make choice of whom your wisest friend
s you will,
    And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me.
    If by direct or by collateral
 hand
    They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,
    Our crown, our life, and all that we
 call ours,
    To you in satisfaction; but if not,
    Be you content to lend your patience to us
,
    And we shall jointly labour with your soul
    To give it due content.
  Laer. Let this be 
so.
    His means of death, his obscure funeral-
    No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bone
s,
    No noble rite nor formal ostentation,-
    Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,

    That I must call't in question.
  King. So you shall;
    And where th' offence is let the g
reat axe fall.
    I pray you go with me.
                                                        
  Exeunt

Scene VI.
Elsinore. Another room in the Castle.

Enter Horatio with
 an Attendant.

  Hor. What are they that would speak with me?
  Servant. Seafaring men, sir. The
y say they have letters for
you.
  Hor. Let them come in.
                                       
        [Exit Attendant.]
    I do not know from what part of the world
    I should be greeted, i
f not from Lord Hamlet.

                          Enter Sailors.

  Sailor. God bless you, sir.

  Hor. Let him bless thee too.
  Sailor. 'A shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter for
yo
u,
    sir,- it comes from th' ambassador that was bound for
England- if
    your name be Horatio
, as I am let to know it is.
  Hor. (reads the letter) 'Horatio, when thou shalt have
overlook'd

    this, give these fellows some means to the King. They have
    letters for him. Ere we were two
 days old at sea, a pirate of

    very warlike appointment gave us chase. Finding ourselves too

    slow of sail, we put on a compelled valour, and in the
grapple I
    boarded them. On the inst
ant they got clear of our ship; so I
    alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with me like

thieves
    of mercy; but they knew what they did: I am to do a good turn
for
    them. Let the 
King have the letters I have sent, and repair
thou
    to me with as much speed as thou wouldst fl
y death. I have
words
    to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb; yet are they much
too
    l
ight for the bore of the matter. These good fellows will
bring
    thee where I am. Rosencrantz an
d Guildenstern hold their
course
    for England. Of them I have much to tell thee. Farewell.
   
                         'He that thou knowest thine, HAMLET.'

    Come, I will give you way for 
these your letters,
    And do't the speedier that you may direct me
    To him from whom you brou
ght them.                   Exeunt.

Scene VII.
Elsinore. Another room in the C
astle.

Enter King and Laertes.

  King. Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
    And 
You must put me in your heart for friend,
    Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
    Tha
t he which hath your noble father slain
    Pursued my life.
  Laer. It well appears. But tell me

    Why you proceeded not against these feats
    So crimeful and so capital in nature,
    As by
 your safety, wisdom, all things else,
    You mainly were stirr'd up.
  King. O, for two special 
reasons,
    Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,
    But yet to me they are strong. Th
e Queen his mother
    Lives almost by his looks; and for myself,-
    My virtue or my plague, be 
it either which,-
    She's so conjunctive to my life and soul
    That, as the star moves not but
 in his sphere,
    I could not but by her. The other motive
    Why to a public count I might not
 go
    Is the great love the general gender bear him,
    Who, dipping all his faults in their af
fection,
    Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
    Convert his gives to graces; s
o that my arrows,
    Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,
    Would have reverted to my bow 
again,
    And not where I had aim'd them.
  Laer. And so have I a noble father lost;
    A siste
r driven into desp'rate terms,
    Whose worth, if praises may go back again,
    Stood challenger
 on mount of all the age
    For her perfections. But my revenge will come.
  King. Break not your
 sleeps for that. You must not think
    That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
    That we ca
n let our beard be shook with danger,
    And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more.
    I
 lov'd your father, and we love ourself,
    And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine-

      
           Enter a Messenger with letters.

    How now? What news?
  Mess. Letters, my lord, fro
m Hamlet:
    This to your Majesty; this to the Queen.
  King. From Hamlet? Who brought them?
  M
ess. Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not.
    They were given me by Claudio; he receiv'd the
m
    Of him that brought them.
  King. Laertes, you shall hear them.
    Leave us.
            
                                     Exit Messenger.
    [Reads]'High and Mighty,-You shall know I 
am set naked on
your
    kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes;
    when I
 shall (first asking your pardon thereunto) recount the
    occasion of my sudden and more strange 
return.
                                                     'HAMLET.'
    What should this mean? 
Are all the rest come back?
    Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?
  Laer. Know you the hand?

  King. 'Tis Hamlet's character. 'Naked!'
    And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'
    Can
 you advise me?
  Laer. I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come!
    It warms the very sickness
 in my heart
    That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,
    'Thus didest thou.'
  King. If 
it be so, Laertes
    (As how should it be so? how otherwise?),
    Will you be rul'd by me?
  La
er. Ay my lord,
    So you will not o'errule me to a peace.
  King. To thine own peace. If he be n
ow return'd
    As checking at his voyage, and that he means
    No more to undertake it, I will w
ork him
    To exploit now ripe in my device,
    Under the which he shall not choose but fall;
 
   And for his death no wind shall breathe
    But even his mother shall uncharge the practice
   
 And call it accident.
  Laer. My lord, I will be rul'd;
    The rather, if you could devise it so

    That I might be the organ.
  King. It falls right.
    You have been talk'd of since your tr
avel much,
    And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality
    Wherein they say you shine, Your su
m of parts
    Did not together pluck such envy from him
    As did that one; and that, in my rega
rd,
    Of the unworthiest siege.
  Laer. What part is that, my lord?
  King. A very riband in th
e cap of youth-
    Yet needfull too; for youth no less becomes
    The light and careless livery 
that it wears
    Than settled age his sables and his weeds,
    Importing health and graveness. T
wo months since
    Here was a gentleman of Normandy.
    I have seen myself, and serv'd against, 
the French,
    And they can well on horseback; but this gallant
    Had witchcraft in't. He grew 
unto his seat,
    And to such wondrous doing brought his horse
    As had he been incorps'd and d
emi-natur'd
    With the brave beast. So far he topp'd my thought
    That I, in forgery of shapes
 and tricks,
    Come short of what he did.
  Laer. A Norman was't?
  King. A Norman.
  Laer. Up
on my life, Lamound.
  King. The very same.
  Laer. I know him well. He is the broach indeed
    
And gem of all the nation.
  King. He made confession of you;
    And gave you such a masterly rep
ort
    For art and exercise in your defence,
    And for your rapier most especially,
    That h
e cried out 'twould be a sight indeed
    If one could match you. The scrimers of their nation
   
 He swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
    If you oppos'd them. Sir, this report of his
   
 Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
    That he could nothing do but wish and beg
    Your sudden
 coming o'er to play with you.
    Now, out of this-
  Laer. What out of this, my lord?
  King. L
aertes, was your father dear to you?
    Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
    A face with
out a heart,'
  Laer. Why ask you this?
  King. Not that I think you did not love your father;
  
  But that I know love is begun by time,
    And that I see, in passages of proof,
    Time qualif
ies the spark and fire of it.
    There lives within the very flame of love
    A kind of wick or 
snuff that will abate it;
    And nothing is at a like goodness still;
    For goodness, growing t
o a plurisy,
    Dies in his own too-much. That we would do,
    We should do when we would; for t
his 'would' changes,
    And hath abatements and delays as many
    As there are tongues, are hand
s, are accidents;
    And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
    That hurts by easing.
 But to the quick o' th' ulcer!
    Hamlet comes back. What would you undertake
    To show yourse
lf your father's son in deed
    More than in words?
  Laer. To cut his throat i' th' church!
  K
ing. No place indeed should murther sanctuarize;
    Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laert
es,
    Will you do this? Keep close within your chamber.
    Hamlet return'd shall know you are c
ome home.
    We'll put on those shall praise your excellence
    And set a double varnish on the 
fame
    The Frenchman gave you; bring you in fine together
    And wager on your heads. He, being
 remiss,
    Most generous, and free from all contriving,
    Will not peruse the foils; so that w
ith ease,
    Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
    A sword unbated, and, in a pass of pr
actice,
    Requite him for your father.
  Laer. I will do't!
    And for that purpose I'll anoin
t my sword.
    I bought an unction of a mountebank,
    So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
 
   Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
    Collected from all simples that have virtue
    
Under the moon, can save the thing from death
    This is but scratch'd withal. I'll touch my point

    With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
    It may be death.
  King. Let's furthe
r think of this,
    Weigh what convenience both of time and means
    May fit us to our shape. If
 this should fall,
    And that our drift look through our bad performance.
    'Twere better not 
assay'd. Therefore this project
    Should have a back or second, that might hold
    If this did 
blast in proof. Soft! let me see.
    We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings-
    I ha't!
   
 When in your motion you are hot and dry-
    As make your bouts more violent to that end-
    And
 that he calls for drink, I'll have prepar'd him
    A chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,

    If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
    Our purpose may hold there.- But stay, what noi
se,

                           Enter Queen.

    How now, sweet queen?
  Queen. One woe doth t
read upon another's heel,
    So fast they follow. Your sister's drown'd, Laertes.
  Laer. Drown'd
! O, where?
  Queen. There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
    That shows his hoar leaves in the
 glassy stream.
    There with fantastic garlands did she come
    Of crowflowers, nettles, daisie
s, and long purples,
    That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
    But our cold maids do dea
d men's fingers call them.
    There on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds
    Clamb'ring to han
g, an envious sliver broke,
    When down her weedy trophies and herself
    Fell in the weeping b
rook. Her clothes spread wide
    And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up;
    Which time she c
haunted snatches of old tunes,
    As one incapable of her own distress,
    Or like a creature na
tive and indued
    Unto that element; but long it could not be
    Till that her garments, heavy 
with their drink,
    Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay
    To muddy death.
  Laer. A
las, then she is drown'd?
  Queen. Drown'd, drown'd.
  Laer. Too much of water hast thou, poor Oph
elia,
    And therefore I forbid my tears; but yet
    It is our trick; nature her custom holds,

    Let shame say what it will. When these are gone,
    The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord.
  
  I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze
    But that this folly douts it.                 
         Exit.
  King. Let's follow, Gertrude.
    How much I had to do to calm his rage I
    No
w fear I this will give it start again;
    Therefore let's follow.
                              
                           Exeunt.

ACT V. Scene I.
Elsinore. A churchyard.


Enter two Clowns, [with spades and pickaxes].

  Clown. Is she to be buried in Christian burial wh
en she
wilfully
    seeks her own salvation?
  Other. I tell thee she is; therefore make her grav
e straight.
    The crowner hath sate on her, and finds it Christian burial.
  Clown. How can that
 be, unless she drown'd herself in her own
    defence?
  Other. Why, 'tis found so.
  Clown. It 
must be se offendendo; it cannot be else. For here
lies
    the point: if I drown myself wittingly
, it argues an act; and
an
    act hath three branches-it is to act, to do, and to perform;
    a
rgal, she drown'd herself wittingly.
  Other. Nay, but hear you, Goodman Delver!
  Clown. Give me 
leave. Here lies the water; good. Here stands
the
    man; good. If the man go to this water and d
rown himself, it
is,
    will he nill he, he goes- mark you that. But if the water
come to
    h
im and drown him, he drowns not himself. Argal, he that is
not
    guilty of his own death shorten
s not his own life.
  Other. But is this law?
  Clown. Ay, marry, is't- crowner's quest law.
  Ot
her. Will you ha' the truth an't? If this had not been a
    gentlewoman, she should have been buri
ed out o' Christian
burial.
  Clown. Why, there thou say'st! And the more pity that great
folk
 
   should have count'nance in this world to drown or hang
themselves
    more than their even-Chri
stian. Come, my spade! There is no
    ancient gentlemen but gard'ners, ditchers, and grave-makers.

They
    hold up Adam's profession.
  Other. Was he a gentleman?
  Clown. 'A was the first that
 ever bore arms.
  Other. Why, he had none.
  Clown. What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand
 the
Scripture?
    The Scripture says Adam digg'd. Could he dig without arms?
I'll
    put anot
her question to thee. If thou answerest me not to the
    purpose, confess thyself-
  Other. Go to
!
  Clown. What is he that builds stronger than either the mason,
the
    shipwright, or the carp
enter?
  Other. The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand
    tenants.
  Clown. I lik
e thy wit well, in good faith. The gallows does
well.
    But how does it well? It does well to th
ose that do ill. Now,
    thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the
    church. 
Argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To't again,
come!
  Other. Who builds stronger than a maso
n, a shipwright, or a
    carpenter?
  Clown. Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
  Other. Marry, now I
 can tell!
  Clown. To't.
  Other. Mass, I cannot tell.

                 Enter Hamlet and Horat
io afar off.

  Clown. Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull ass
will
    not mend h
is pace with beating; and when you are ask'd this
    question next, say 'a grave-maker.' The house
s he makes lasts
    till doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan; fetch me a stoup of
    liquor.
    
                                        [Exit Second Clown.]


                       [Clown digs
 and] sings.

       In youth when I did love, did love,
         Methought it was very sweet;
 
      To contract- O- the time for- a- my behove,
         O, methought there- a- was nothing- a- m
eet.

  Ham. Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings
at
    grave-making?
  H
or. Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.
  Ham. 'Tis e'en so. The hand of little empl
oyment hath the
daintier
    sense.
  Clown. (sings)
         But age with his stealing steps
 
          Hath clawed me in his clutch,
         And hath shipped me intil the land,
           As
 if I had never been such.
                                            [Throws up a skull.]

  Ha
m. That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once. How
the
    knave jowls it to the ground,as
 if 'twere Cain's jawbone,
that
    did the first murther! This might be the pate of a
Politician
,
    which this ass now o'erreaches; one that would circumvent
God,
    might it not?
  Hor. It
 might, my lord.
  Ham. Or of a courtier, which could say 'Good morrow, sweet
lord!
    How dost 
thou, good lord?' This might be my Lord Such-a-one,
that
    prais'd my Lord Such-a-one's horse wh
en he meant to beg it-
might
    it not?
  Hor. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Why, e'en so! and now my Lad
y Worm's, chapless, and
knock'd
    about the mazzard with a sexton's spade. Here's fine
revoluti
on,
    and we had the trick to see't. Did these bones cost no more
the
    breeding but to play 
at loggets with 'em? Mine ache to think
    on't.
  Clown. (Sings)
         A pickaxe and a spade
, a spade,
           For and a shrouding sheet;
         O, a Pit of clay for to be made
       
    For such a guest is meet.
                                      Throws up [another skull].

 
 Ham. There's another. Why may not that be the skull of a
lawyer?
    Where be his quiddits now, h
is quillets, his cases, his
tenures,
    and his tricks? Why does he suffer this rude knave now to

knock
    him about the sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell
him
    of his action of 
battery? Hum! This fellow might be in's time
a
    great buyer of land, with his statutes, his rec
ognizances,
his
    fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries. Is this the fine
of
    his fine
s, and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his
fine
    pate full of fine dirt? Will his vouch
ers vouch him no more
of
    his purchases, and double ones too, than the length and
breadth
   
 of a pair of indentures? The very conveyances of his lands
will
    scarcely lie in this box; and
 must th' inheritor himself have
no
    more, ha?
  Hor. Not a jot more, my lord.
  Ham. Is not 
parchment made of sheepskins?
  Hor. Ay, my lord, And of calveskins too.
  Ham. They are sheep and
 calves which seek out assurance in
that. I
    will speak to this fellow. Whose grave's this, sir
rah?
  Clown. Mine, sir.

    [Sings] O, a pit of clay for to be made
              For such a g
uest is meet.

  Ham. I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in't.
  Clown. You lie out on't,
 sir, and therefore 'tis not yours.
    For my part, I do not lie in't, yet it is mine.
  Ham. Tho
u dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine. 'Tis
for
    the dead, not for the quick; therefo
re thou liest.
  Clown. 'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away again from me to you.
  Ham. What man d
ost thou dig it for?
  Clown. For no man, sir.
  Ham. What woman then?
  Clown. For none neither.

  Ham. Who is to be buried in't?
  Clown. One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's
d
ead.
  Ham. How absolute the knave is! We must speak by the card, or
    equivocation will undo us
. By the Lord, Horatio, this three
years
    I have taken note of it, the age is grown so picked t
hat the
toe
    of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he
galls
    his kibe.- Ho
w long hast thou been a grave-maker?
  Clown. Of all the days i' th' year, I came to't that day tha
t
our
    last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.
  Ham. How long is that since?
  Clown. Cannot y
ou tell that? Every fool can tell that. It was
the
    very day that young Hamlet was born- he tha
t is mad, and sent
    into England.
  Ham. Ay, marry, why was be sent into England?
  Clown. Why
, because 'a was mad. 'A shall recover his wits
there;
    or, if 'a do not, 'tis no great matter 
there.
  Ham. Why?
  Clown. 'Twill not he seen in him there. There the men are as
mad as
    he.

  Ham. How came he mad?
  Clown. Very strangely, they say.
  Ham. How strangely?
  Clown. Faith
, e'en with losing his wits.
  Ham. Upon what ground?
  Clown. Why, here in Denmark. I have been s
exton here, man and
boy
    thirty years.
  Ham. How long will a man lie i' th' earth ere he rot?

  Clown. Faith, if 'a be not rotten before 'a die (as we have
many
    pocky corses now-a-days t
hat will scarce hold the laying in,
I
    will last you some eight year or nine year. A tanner wil
l
last
    you nine year.
  Ham. Why he more than another?
  Clown. Why, sir, his hide is so tan
n'd with his trade that 'a
will
    keep out water a great while; and your water is a sore
decaye
r of
    your whoreson dead body. Here's a skull now. This skull hath
lien
    you i' th' earth t
hree-and-twenty years.
  Ham. Whose was it?
  Clown. A whoreson, mad fellow's it was. Whose do you
 think it
was?
  Ham. Nay, I know not.
  Clown. A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! 'A pour'd a 
flagon
of
    Rhenish on my head once. This same skull, sir, was Yorick's
    skull, the King's j
ester.
  Ham. This?
  Clown. E'en that.
  Ham. Let me see. [Takes the skull.] Alas, poor Yorick! 
I knew
him,
    Horatio. A fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy.
He
    hath borne m
e on his back a thousand times. And now how
abhorred
    in my imagination it is! My gorge rises a
t it. Here hung
those
    lips that I have kiss'd I know not how oft. Where be your
gibes
    no
w? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment that
    were wont to set the table on a roa
r? Not one now, to mock
your
    own grinning? Quite chap- fall'n? Now get you to my lady's
    c
hamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this
    favour she must come. Make her laugh
 at that. Prithee,
Horatio,
    tell me one thing.
  Hor. What's that, my lord?
  Ham. Dost thou
 think Alexander look'd o' this fashion i' th'
earth?
  Hor. E'en so.
  Ham. And smelt so? Pah!

                                          [Puts down the skull.]
  Hor. E'en so, my lord.
  Ham. T
o what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not
    imagination trace the noble dust of Alexan
der till he find it
    stopping a bunghole?
  Hor. 'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider 
so.
  Ham. No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with
modesty
    enough, and likelihoo
d to lead it; as thus: Alexander died,
    Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the
 dust
is
    earth; of earth we make loam; and why of that loam (whereto
he
    was converted) m
ight they not stop a beer barrel?
    Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
    Might stop a 
hole to keep the wind away.
    O, that that earth which kept the world in awe
    Should patch a 
wall t' expel the winter's flaw!
    But soft! but soft! aside! Here comes the King-

    Enter [
priests with] a coffin [in funeral procession], King,
             Queen, Laertes, with Lords atten
dant.]

    The Queen, the courtiers. Who is this they follow?
    And with such maimed rites? Th
is doth betoken
    The corse they follow did with desp'rate hand
    Fordo it own life. 'Twas of 
some estate.
    Couch we awhile, and mark.
                                         [Retires with
 Horatio.]

  Laer. What ceremony else?
  Ham. That is Laertes,
    A very noble youth. Mark.
 
 Laer. What ceremony else?
  Priest. Her obsequies have been as far enlarg'd
    As we have warran
ty. Her death was doubtful;
    And, but that great command o'ersways the order,
    She should in
 ground unsanctified have lodg'd
    Till the last trumpet. For charitable prayers,
    Shards, fl
ints, and pebbles should be thrown on her.
    Yet here she is allow'd her virgin rites,
    Her m
aiden strewments, and the bringing home
    Of bell and burial.
  Laer. Must there no more be done
?
  Priest. No more be done.
    We should profane the service of the dead
    To sing a requiem 
and such rest to her
    As to peace-parted souls.
  Laer. Lay her i' th' earth;
    And from her
 fair and unpolluted flesh
    May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,
    A minist'ring
 angel shall my sister be
    When thou liest howling.
  Ham. What, the fair Ophelia?
  Queen. Sw
eets to the sweet! Farewell.
                                             [Scatters flowers.]
    
I hop'd thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
    I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet
 maid,
    And not have strew'd thy grave.
  Laer. O, treble woe
    Fall ten times treble on tha
t cursed head
    Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
    Depriv'd thee of! Hold off the ea
rth awhile,
    Till I have caught her once more in mine arms.
                                   
          Leaps in the grave.
    Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead
    Till of this flat
 a mountain you have made
    T' o'ertop old Pelion or the skyish head
    Of blue Olympus.
  Ham
. [comes forward] What is he whose grief
    Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow
    Co
njures the wand'ring stars, and makes them stand
    Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,
    H
amlet the Dane.                    [Leaps in after Laertes.
  Laer. The devil take thy soul!
     
                                       [Grapples with him].
  Ham. Thou pray'st not well.
    I pr
ithee take thy fingers from my throat;
    For, though I am not splenitive and rash,
    Yet have 
I in me something dangerous,
    Which let thy wisdom fear. Hold off thy hand!
  King. Pluck them 
asunder.
  Queen. Hamlet, Hamlet!
  All. Gentlemen!
  Hor. Good my lord, be quiet.
             
[The Attendants part them, and they come out of the
                                               
          grave.]
  Ham. Why, I will fight with him upon this theme
    Until my eyelids will no l
onger wag.
  Queen. O my son, what theme?
  Ham. I lov'd Ophelia. Forty thousand brothers
    Cou
ld not (with all their quantity of love)
    Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?
  King. O,
 he is mad, Laertes.
  Queen. For love of God, forbear him!
  Ham. 'Swounds, show me what thou't d
o.
    Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?
    Woo't drink up esill? eat a cr
ocodile?
    I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?
    To outface me with leaping in her grave?

    Be buried quick with her, and so will I.
    And if thou prate of mountains, let them throw

    Millions of acres on us, till our ground,
    Singeing his pate against the burning zone,
    
Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
    I'll rant as well as thou.
  Queen. This is mere
 madness;
    And thus a while the fit will work on him.
    Anon, as patient as the female dove

    When that her golden couplets are disclos'd,
    His silence will sit drooping.
  Ham. Hear yo
u, sir!
    What is the reason that you use me thus?
    I lov'd you ever. But it is no matter.
 
   Let Hercules himself do what he may,
    The cat will mew, and dog will have his day.
Exit.
  
King. I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.
                                                   
Exit Horatio.
    [To Laertes] Strengthen your patience in our last night's
speech.
    We'll put
 the matter to the present push.-
    Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.-
    This grave
 shall have a living monument.
    An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
    Till then in patienc
e our proceeding be.
                                                         Exeunt.




Scen
e II.
Elsinore. A hall in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet and Horatio.

  Ham. So much for this, sir;
 now shall you see the other.
    You do remember all the circumstance?
  Hor. Remember it, my lor
d!
  Ham. Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting
    That would not let me sleep. Methought
 I lay
    Worse than the mutinies in the bilboes. Rashly-
    And prais'd be rashness for it; let
 us know,
    Our indiscretion sometime serves us well
    When our deep plots do pall; and that s
hould learn us
    There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
    Rough-hew them how we will-
  Hor
. That is most certain.
  Ham. Up from my cabin,
    My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
  
  Grop'd I to find out them; had my desire,
    Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew
    To
 mine own room again; making so bold
    (My fears forgetting manners) to unseal
    Their grand c
ommission; where I found, Horatio
    (O royal knavery!), an exact command,
    Larded with many s
everal sorts of reasons,
    Importing Denmark's health, and England's too,
    With, hoo! such bu
gs and goblins in my life-
    That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
    No, not to stay the f
inding of the axe,
    My head should be struck off.
  Hor. Is't possible?
  Ham. Here's the comm
ission; read it at more leisure.
    But wilt thou bear me how I did proceed?
  Hor. I beseech you
.
  Ham. Being thus benetted round with villanies,
    Or I could make a prologue to my brains,
 
   They had begun the play. I sat me down;
    Devis'd a new commission; wrote it fair.
    I once
 did hold it, as our statists do,
    A baseness to write fair, and labour'd much
    How to forge
t that learning; but, sir, now
    It did me yeoman's service. Wilt thou know
    Th' effect of wh
at I wrote?
  Hor. Ay, good my lord.
  Ham. An earnest conjuration from the King,
    As England 
was his faithful tributary,
    As love between them like the palm might flourish,
    As peace sh
ould still her wheaten garland wear
    And stand a comma 'tween their amities,
    And many such-
like as's of great charge,
    That, on the view and knowing of these contents,
    Without debate
ment further, more or less,
    He should the bearers put to sudden death,
    Not shriving time a
llow'd.
  Hor. How was this seal'd?
  Ham. Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
    I had my fa
ther's signet in my purse,
    Which was the model of that Danish seal;
    Folded the writ up in 
the form of th' other,
    Subscrib'd it, gave't th' impression, plac'd it safely,
    The changel
ing never known. Now, the next day
    Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent
    Thou kn
ow'st already.
  Hor. So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.
  Ham. Why, man, they did make love
 to this employment!
    They are not near my conscience; their defeat
    Does by their own insin
uation grow.
    'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
    Between the pass and fell incensed
 points
    Of mighty opposites.
  Hor. Why, what a king is this!
  Ham. Does it not, thinks't th
ee, stand me now upon-
    He that hath kill'd my king, and whor'd my mother;
    Popp'd in betwee
n th' election and my hopes;
    Thrown out his angle for my proper life,
    And with such coz'na
ge- is't not perfect conscience
    To quit him with this arm? And is't not to be damn'd
    To le
t this canker of our nature come
    In further evil?
  Hor. It must be shortly known to him from 
England
    What is the issue of the business there.
  Ham. It will be short; the interim is mine,

    And a man's life is no more than to say 'one.'
    But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
    Th
at to Laertes I forgot myself,
    For by the image of my cause I see
    The portraiture of his. 
I'll court his favours.
    But sure the bravery of his grief did put me
    Into a tow'ring passi
on.
  Hor. Peace! Who comes here?

                 Enter young Osric, a courtier.

  Osr. Your
 lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
  Ham. I humbly thank you, sir. [Aside to Horatio] Dost
 know this
    waterfly?
  Hor. [aside to Hamlet] No, my good lord.
  Ham. [aside to Horatio] Thy
 state is the more gracious; for
'tis a
    vice to know him. He hath much land, and fertile. Let 
a beast
be
    lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at the king's mess.
'Tis
    a chough; b
ut, as I say, spacious in the possession of dirt.

  Osr. Sweet lord, if your lordship were at lei
sure, I should
impart
    a thing to you from his Majesty.
  Ham. I will receive it, sir, with al
l diligence of spirit. Put
your
    bonnet to his right use. 'Tis for the head.
  Osr. I thank yo
ur lordship, it is very hot.
  Ham. No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly.
  Osr. 
It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
  Ham. But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my

complexion.
  Osr. Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry, as 'twere- I
cannot
    tell how. But
, my lord, his Majesty bade me signify to you
that
    he has laid a great wager on your head. Sir
, this is the
matter-
  Ham. I beseech you remember.
                           [Hamlet moves him
 to put on his hat.]
  Osr. Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here
is
    new
ly come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute
gentleman,
    full of most excellent difference
s, of very soft society and
    great showing. Indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the
card

    or calendar of gentry; for you shall find in him the
continent of
    what part a gentleman wo
uld see.
  Ham. Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you; though, I

    know, to divide h
im inventorially would dozy th' arithmetic
of
    memory, and yet but yaw neither in respect of hi
s quick sail.
    But, in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of
great
    article, 
and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as, to
make
    true diction of him, his semblable is
 his mirror, and who
else
    would trace him, his umbrage, nothing more.
  Osr. Your lordship sp
eaks most infallibly of him.
  Ham. The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our
more

    rawer breath?
  Osr. Sir?
  Hor [aside to Hamlet] Is't not possible to understand in
anothe
r
    tongue? You will do't, sir, really.
  Ham. What imports the nomination of this gentleman?
 
 Osr. Of Laertes?
  Hor. [aside] His purse is empty already. All's golden words are
    spent.
  
Ham. Of him, sir.
  Osr. I know you are not ignorant-
  Ham. I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, 
if you did, it would
not
    much approve me. Well, sir?
  Osr. You are not ignorant of what exce
llence Laertes is-
  Ham. I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in
    excellenc
e; but to know a man well were to know himself.
  Osr. I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the impu
tation laid on
him
    by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.
  Ham. What's his weapon?
  Osr. Ra
pier and dagger.
  Ham. That's two of his weapons- but well.
  Osr. The King, sir, hath wager'd wi
th him six Barbary horses;
    against the which he has impon'd, as I take it, six French
    rapi
ers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers,
and
    so. Three of the carriages, in f
aith, are very dear to fancy,
    very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of
  
  very liberal conceit.
  Ham. What call you the carriages?
  Hor. [aside to Hamlet] I knew you mu
st be edified by the
margent
    ere you had done.
  Osr. The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
 
 Ham. The phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could
    carry cannon by our sides. I w
ould it might be hangers till
then.
    But on! Six Barbary horses against six French swords, thei
r
    assigns, and three liberal-conceited carriages: that's the
French
    bet against the Danis
h. Why is this all impon'd, as you call
it?
  Osr. The King, sir, hath laid that, in a dozen passe
s between
    yourself and him, he shall not exceed you three hits; he hath
    laid on twelve for
 nine, and it would come to immediate trial
    if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.
  Ham
. How if I answer no?
  Osr. I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
  Ham. Sir, 
I will walk here in the hall. If it please his
Majesty,
    it is the breathing time of day with m
e. Let the foils be
    brought, the gentleman willing, and the King hold his
purpose,
    I will
 win for him if I can; if not, I will gain nothing but
my
    shame and the odd hits.
  Osr. Shal
l I redeliver you e'en so?
  Ham. To this effect, sir, after what flourish your nature will.
  Osr
. I commend my duty to your lordship.
  Ham. Yours, yours. [Exit Osric.] He does well to commend it

    himself; there are no tongues else for's turn.
  Hor. This lapwing runs away with the shell o
n his head.
  Ham. He did comply with his dug before he suck'd it. Thus has
he,
    and many more
 of the same bevy that I know the drossy age
dotes
    on, only got the tune of the time and outwa
rd habit of
encounter-
    a kind of yesty collection, which carries them through and
    through
 the most fann'd and winnowed opinions; and do but
blow
    them to their trial-the bubbles are ou
t,

                            Enter a Lord.

  Lord. My lord, his Majesty commended him to you
 by young Osric,
who
    brings back to him, that you attend him in the hall. He sends
to
    kn
ow if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you
will
    take longer time.
  Ham. I am
 constant to my purposes; they follow the King's
pleasure.
    If his fitness speaks, mine is read
y; now or whensoever,
provided
    I be so able as now.
  Lord. The King and Queen and all are co
ming down.
  Ham. In happy time.
  Lord. The Queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to

    Laertes before you fall to play.
  Ham. She well instructs me.
                             
                       [Exit Lord.]
  Hor. You will lose this wager, my lord.
  Ham. I do not thin
k so. Since he went into France I have been
in
    continual practice. I shall win at the odds. Bu
t thou wouldst
not
    think how ill all's here about my heart. But it is no matter.
  Hor. Nay, 
good my lord -
  Ham. It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gaingiving as
    would perhaps 
trouble a woman.
  Hor. If your mind dislike anything, obey it. I will forestall
their
    repair
 hither and say you are not fit.
  Ham. Not a whit, we defy augury; there's a special providence
i
n
    the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not to come; if it
be
    not to come, it will be
 now; if it be not now, yet it will
come:
    the readiness is all. Since no man knows aught of wh
at he
leaves,
    what is't to leave betimes? Let be.

    Enter King, Queen, Laertes, Osric, an
d Lords, with other
              Attendants with foils and gauntlets.
               A table and 
flagons of wine on it.

  King. Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
                 
   [The King puts Laertes' hand into Hamlet's.]
  Ham. Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wr
ong;
    But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.
    This presence knows,
    And you must needs ha
ve heard, how I am punish'd
    With sore distraction. What I have done
    That might your nature
, honour, and exception
    Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
    Was't Hamlet wrong'd L
aertes? Never Hamlet.
    If Hamlet from himself be taken away,
    And when he's not himself does
 wrong Laertes,
    Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
    Who does it, then? His madness.
 If't be so,
    Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
    His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.

    Sir, in this audience,
    Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd evil
    Free me so far in you
r most generous thoughts
    That I have shot my arrow o'er the house
    And hurt my brother.
  
Laer. I am satisfied in nature,
    Whose motive in this case should stir me most
    To my reveng
e. But in my terms of honour
    I stand aloof, and will no reconcilement
    Till by some elder m
asters of known honour
    I have a voice and precedent of peace
    To keep my name ungor'd. But 
till that time
    I do receive your offer'd love like love,
    And will not wrong it.
  Ham. I 
embrace it freely,
    And will this brother's wager frankly play.
    Give us the foils. Come on.

  Laer. Come, one for me.
  Ham. I'll be your foil, Laertes. In mine ignorance
    Your skill sh
all, like a star i' th' darkest night,
    Stick fiery off indeed.
  Laer. You mock me, sir.
  Ha
m. No, by this hand.
  King. Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
    You know the wag
er?
  Ham. Very well, my lord.
    Your Grace has laid the odds o' th' weaker side.
  King. I do 
not fear it, I have seen you both;
    But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.
  Laer. T
his is too heavy; let me see another.
  Ham. This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
  
                                              Prepare to play.
  Osr. Ay, my good lord.
  King. Se
t me the stoups of wine upon that table.
    If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
    Or quit i
n answer of the third exchange,
    Let all the battlements their ordnance fire;
    The King shal
l drink to Hamlet's better breath,
    And in the cup an union shall he throw
    Richer than that
 which four successive kings
    In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;
    And let the k
ettle to the trumpet speak,
    The trumpet to the cannoneer without,
    The cannons to the heave
ns, the heaven to earth,
    'Now the King drinks to Hamlet.' Come, begin.
    And you the judges,
 bear a wary eye.
  Ham. Come on, sir.
  Laer. Come, my lord.                                They 
play.
  Ham. One.
  Laer. No.
  Ham. Judgment!
  Osr. A hit, a very palpable hit.
  Laer. Well,
 again!
  King. Stay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
    Here's to thy health.
     
          [Drum; trumpets sound; a piece goes off [within].
    Give him the cup.
  Ham. I'll play
 this bout first; set it by awhile.
    Come. (They play.) Another hit. What say you?
  Laer. A to
uch, a touch; I do confess't.
  King. Our son shall win.
  Queen. He's fat, and scant of breath.

    Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows.
    The Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
  
Ham. Good madam!
  King. Gertrude, do not drink.
  Queen. I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.  
        Drinks.
  King. [aside] It is the poison'd cup; it is too late.
  Ham. I dare not drink ye
t, madam; by-and-by.
  Queen. Come, let me wipe thy face.
  Laer. My lord, I'll hit him now.
  Ki
ng. I do not think't.
  Laer. [aside] And yet it is almost against my conscience.
  Ham. Come for 
the third, Laertes! You but dally.
    Pray you pass with your best violence;
    I am afeard you 
make a wanton of me.
  Laer. Say you so? Come on.                               Play.
  Osr. Nothi
ng neither way.
  Laer. Have at you now!
                [Laertes wounds Hamlet; then] in scufflin
g, they
                    change rapiers, [and Hamlet wounds Laertes].
  King. Part them! They a
re incens'd.
  Ham. Nay come! again!                         The Queen falls.

  Osr. Look to the
 Queen there, ho!
  Hor. They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?
  Osr. How is't, Laertes?

  Laer. Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric.
    I am justly kill'd with mine own treache
ry.
  Ham. How does the Queen?
  King. She sounds to see them bleed.
  Queen. No, no! the drink, 
the drink! O my dear Hamlet!
    The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.                 [Dies.]
  Ha
m. O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd.
    Treachery! Seek it out.
                            
                    [Laertes falls.]
  Laer. It is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain;
    No me
dicine in the world can do thee good.
    In thee there is not half an hour of life.
    The treac
herous instrument is in thy hand,
    Unbated and envenom'd. The foul practice
    Hath turn'd its
elf on me. Lo, here I lie,
    Never to rise again. Thy mother's poison'd.
    I can no more. The 
King, the King's to blame.
  Ham. The point envenom'd too?
    Then, venom, to thy work.          
          Hurts the King.
  All. Treason! treason!
  King. O, yet defend me, friends! I am but hur
t.
  Ham. Here, thou incestuous, murd'rous, damned Dane,
    Drink off this potion! Is thy union h
ere?
    Follow my mother.                                 King dies.
  Laer. He is justly serv'd.

    It is a poison temper'd by himself.
    Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet.
    Mine
 and my father's death come not upon thee,
    Nor thine on me!                                    
   Dies.
  Ham. Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.
    I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen
, adieu!
    You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
    That are but mutes or audience to 
this act,
    Had I but time (as this fell sergeant, Death,
    Is strict in his arrest) O, I coul
d tell you-
    But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;
    Thou liv'st; report me and my cause aright

    To the unsatisfied.
  Hor. Never believe it.
    I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.
   
 Here's yet some liquor left.
  Ham. As th'art a man,
    Give me the cup. Let go! By heaven, I'll
 ha't.
    O good Horatio, what a wounded name
    (Things standing thus unknown) shall live behin
d me!
    If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,
    Absent thee from felicity awhile,
    And 
in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
    To tell my story.         [March afar off, and sho
t within.]
    What warlike noise is this?
  Osr. Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland
,
    To the ambassadors of England gives
    This warlike volley.
  Ham. O, I die, Horatio!
   
 The potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit.
    I cannot live to hear the news from England,
   
 But I do prophesy th' election lights
    On Fortinbras. He has my dying voice.
    So tell him, 
with th' occurrents, more and less,
    Which have solicited- the rest is silence.             Dies
.
  Hor. Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince,
    And flights of angels sing thee t
o thy rest!
                                                 [March within.]
    Why does the drum
 come hither?

    Enter Fortinbras and English Ambassadors, with Drum,
                  Colours
, and Attendants.

  Fort. Where is this sight?
  Hor. What is it you will see?
    If aught of 
woe or wonder, cease your search.
  Fort. This quarry cries on havoc. O proud Death,
    What feas
t is toward in thine eternal cell
    That thou so many princes at a shot
    So bloodily hast str
uck.
  Ambassador. The sight is dismal;
    And our affairs from England come too late.
    The e
ars are senseless that should give us hearing
    To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd
    Tha
t Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.
    Where should we have our thanks?
  Hor. Not from his 
mouth,
    Had it th' ability of life to thank you.
    He never gave commandment for their death.

    But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
    You from the Polack wars, and you from Engl
and,
    Are here arriv'd, give order that these bodies
    High on a stage be placed to the view;

    And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
    How these things came about. So shall you hea
r
    Of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts;
    Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters;
    O
f deaths put on by cunning and forc'd cause;
    And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
    Fall'n 
on th' inventors' heads. All this can I
    Truly deliver.
  Fort. Let us haste to hear it,
    A
nd call the noblest to the audience.
    For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.
    I have some
 rights of memory in this kingdom
    Which now, to claim my vantage doth invite me.
  Hor. Of tha
t I shall have also cause to speak,
    And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more.
    But 
let this same be presently perform'd,
    Even while men's minds are wild, lest more mischance
   
 On plots and errors happen.
  Fort. Let four captains
    Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage
;
    For he was likely, had he been put on,
    To have prov'd most royally; and for his passage

    The soldiers' music and the rites of war
    Speak loudly for him.
    Take up the bodies. Su
ch a sight as this
    Becomes the field but here shows much amiss.
    Go, bid the soldiers shoot
.
            Exeunt marching; after the which a peal of ordnance
                                
                   are shot off.

ACT I. Sce
ne I.
Elsinore. A platform before the Castle.

Enter two Sentinels-[first,] Francisco, [who paces
 up and down
at his post; then] Bernardo, [who approaches him].

  Ber. Who's there?
  Fran. Nay
, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.
  Ber. Long live the King!
  Fran. Bernardo?
  Ber. He.

  Fran. You come most carefully upon your hour.
  Ber. 'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Fra
ncisco.
  Fran. For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold,
    And I am sick at heart.
  Ber.
 Have you had quiet guard?
  Fran. Not a mouse stirring.
  Ber. Well, good night.
    If you do m
eet Horatio and Marcellus,
    The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.

                    
Enter Horatio and Marcellus.

  Fran. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?
  Hor. Friend
s to this ground.
  Mar. And liegemen to the Dane.
  Fran. Give you good night.
  Mar. O, farewel
l, honest soldier.
    Who hath reliev'd you?
  Fran. Bernardo hath my place.
    Give you good n
ight.                                   Exit.
  Mar. Holla, Bernardo!
  Ber. Say-
    What, is Ho
ratio there ?
  Hor. A piece of him.
  Ber. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.
  Mar. Wha
t, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
  Ber. I have seen nothing.
  Mar. Horatio says 'tis bu
t our fantasy,
    And will not let belief take hold of him
    Touching this dreaded sight, twice
 seen of us.
    Therefore I have entreated him along,
    With us to watch the minutes of this ni
ght,
    That, if again this apparition come,
    He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
  Hor.
 Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
  Ber. Sit down awhile,
    And let us once again assail your ears
,
    That are so fortified against our story,
    What we two nights have seen.
  Hor. Well, sit
 we down,
    And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
  Ber. Last night of all,
    When yond sam
e star that's westward from the pole
    Had made his course t' illume that part of heaven
    Whe
re now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
    The bell then beating one-

                        En
ter Ghost.

  Mar. Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!
  Ber. In the same figure, l
ike the King that's dead.
  Mar. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
  Ber. Looks it not lik
e the King? Mark it, Horatio.
  Hor. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.
  Ber. It woul
d be spoke to.
  Mar. Question it, Horatio.
  Hor. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night

    Together with that fair and warlike form
    In which the majesty of buried Denmark
    Did s
ometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!
  Mar. It is offended.
  Ber. See, it stalks away!

  Hor. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!
                                                  
   Exit Ghost.
  Mar. 'Tis gone and will not answer.
  Ber. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look
 pale.
    Is not this something more than fantasy?
    What think you on't?
  Hor. Before my God
, I might not this believe
    Without the sensible and true avouch
    Of mine own eyes.
  Mar. 
Is it not like the King?
  Hor. As thou art to thyself.
    Such was the very armour he had on
  
  When he th' ambitious Norway combated.
    So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,
    He sm
ote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
    'Tis strange.
  Mar. Thus twice before, and jump at this d
ead hour,
    With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
  Hor. In what particular thought to w
ork I know not;
    But, in the gross and scope of my opinion,
    This bodes some strange eruptio
n to our state.
  Mar. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows,
    Why this same strict and
 most observant watch
    So nightly toils the subject of the land,
    And why such daily cast of
 brazen cannon
    And foreign mart for implements of war;
    Why such impress of shipwrights, wh
ose sore task
    Does not divide the Sunday from the week.
    What might be toward, that this sw
eaty haste
    Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day?
    Who is't that can inform me?

  Hor. That can I.
    At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
    Whose image even but now 
appear'd to us,
    Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
    Thereto prick'd on by a most em
ulate pride,
    Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet
    (For so this side of our kno
wn world esteem'd him)
    Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,
    Well ratified b
y law and heraldry,
    Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
    Which he stood seiz'd 
of, to the conqueror;
    Against the which a moiety competent
    Was gaged by our king; which ha
d return'd
    To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
    Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'n
ant
    And carriage of the article design'd,
    His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,

    Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
    Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,
    Shar
k'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
    For food and diet, to some enterprise
    That hath a stom
ach in't; which is no other,
    As it doth well appear unto our state,
    But to recover of us, 
by strong hand
    And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
    So by his father lost; and thi
s, I take it,
    Is the main motive of our preparations,
    The source of this our watch, and th
e chief head
    Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
  Ber. I think it be no other but e'en
 so.
    Well may it sort that this portentous figure
    Comes armed through our watch, so like t
he King
    That was and is the question of these wars.
  Hor. A mote it is to trouble the mind's 
eye.
    In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
    A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
  
  The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead
    Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;

    As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood,
    Disasters in the sun; and the moist star

    Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
    Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.
 
   And even the like precurse of fierce events,
    As harbingers preceding still the fates
    An
d prologue to the omen coming on,
    Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
    Unto our cli
mature and countrymen.

                      Enter Ghost again.

    But soft! behold! Lo, wher
e it comes again!
    I'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!
                         
                      Spreads his arms.
    If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
    Speak to 
me.
    If there be any good thing to be done,
    That may to thee do ease, and, race to me,
   
 Speak to me.
    If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
    Which happily foreknowing may avoid
,
    O, speak!
    Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
    Extorted treasure in the womb of ea
rth
    (For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death),
                                    
             The cock crows.
    Speak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!
  Mar. Shall I
 strike at it with my partisan?
  Hor. Do, if it will not stand.
  Ber. 'Tis here!
  Hor. 'Tis he
re!
  Mar. 'Tis gone!
                                                     Exit Ghost.
    We do 
it wrong, being so majestical,
    To offer it the show of violence;
    For it is as the air, inv
ulnerable,
    And our vain blows malicious mockery.
  Ber. It was about to speak, when the cock c
rew.
  Hor. And then it started, like a guilty thing
    Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
   
 The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
    Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
   
 Awake the god of day; and at his warning,
    Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
    Th' ex
travagant and erring spirit hies
    To his confine; and of the truth herein
    This present obje
ct made probation.
  Mar. It faded on the crowing of the cock.
    Some say that ever, 'gainst tha
t season comes
    Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
    The bird of dawning singeth all 
night long;
    And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,
    The nights are wholesome, then
 no planets strike,
    No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
    So hallow'd and so grac
ious is the time.
  Hor. So have I heard and do in part believe it.
    But look, the morn, in rus
set mantle clad,
    Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.
    Break we our watch up; and 
by my advice
    Let us impart what we have seen to-night
    Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life
,
    This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
    Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it
,
    As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
    Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know

    Where we shall find him most conveniently.           Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A roo
m of state in the Castle.

Flourish. [Enter Claudius, King of Denmark, Gertrude the Queen,
Hamlet
,
Polonius, Laertes and his sister Ophelia, [Voltemand, Cornelius,]
Lords Attendant.

  King. Th
ough yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
    The memory be green, and that it us befitted
    T
o bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom
    To be contracted in one brow of woe,
    Yet
 so far hath discretion fought with nature
    That we with wisest sorrow think on him
    Togethe
r with remembrance of ourselves.
    Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
    Th' imperia
l jointress to this warlike state,
    Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,
    With an auspici
ous, and a dropping eye,
    With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,
    In equal scale
 weighing delight and dole,
    Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd
    Your better wisdoms, 
which have freely gone
    With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
    Now follows, that you 
know, young Fortinbras,
    Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
    Or thinking by our late dear
 brother's death
    Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
    Colleagued with this dream of 
his advantage,
    He hath not fail'd to pester us with message
    Importing the surrender of tho
se lands
    Lost by his father, with all bands of law,
    To our most valiant brother. So much f
or him.
    Now for ourself and for this time of meeting.
    Thus much the business is: we have h
ere writ
    To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,
    Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears
 
   Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress
    His further gait herein, in that the levies,
    
The lists, and full proportions are all made
    Out of his subject; and we here dispatch
    You,
 good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,
    For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,
    Giving to
 you no further personal power
    To business with the King, more than the scope
    Of these dil
ated articles allow.            [Gives a paper.]
    Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty
.
  Cor., Volt. In that, and all things, will we show our duty.
  King. We doubt it nothing. Heart
ily farewell.
                                 Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius.
    And now, Laerte
s, what's the news with you?
    You told us of some suit. What is't, Laertes?
    You cannot spea
k of reason to the Dane
    And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
    That shall no
t be my offer, not thy asking?
    The head is not more native to the heart,
    The hand more ins
trumental to the mouth,
    Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
    What wouldst thou hav
e, Laertes?
  Laer. My dread lord,
    Your leave and favour to return to France;
    From whence
 though willingly I came to Denmark
    To show my duty in your coronation,
    Yet now I must con
fess, that duty done,
    My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
    And bow them to your
 gracious leave and pardon.
  King. Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
  Pol. He ha
th, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
    By laboursome petition, and at last
    Upon his will
 I seal'd my hard consent.
    I do beseech you give him leave to go.
  King. Take thy fair hour, 
Laertes. Time be thine,
    And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
    But now, my cousin Hamle
t, and my son-
  Ham. [aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind!
  King. How is it that t
he clouds still hang on you?
  Ham. Not so, my lord. I am too much i' th' sun.
  Queen. Good Hamle
t, cast thy nighted colour off,
    And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
    Do not fo
r ever with thy vailed lids
    Seek for thy noble father in the dust.
    Thou know'st 'tis commo
n. All that lives must die,
    Passing through nature to eternity.
  Ham. Ay, madam, it is common
.
  Queen. If it be,
    Why seems it so particular with thee?
  Ham. Seems, madam, Nay, it is. I
 know not 'seems.'
    'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
    Nor customary suits of solem
n black,
    Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,
    No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
 
   Nor the dejected havior of the visage,
    Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
   
 'That can denote me truly. These indeed seem,
    For they are actions that a man might play;
   
 But I have that within which passeth show-
    These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
  Ki
ng. 'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
    To give these mourning duties to your fa
ther;
    But you must know, your father lost a father;
    That father lost, lost his, and the su
rvivor bound
    In filial obligation for some term
    To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever

    In obstinate condolement is a course
    Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief;
    It s
hows a will most incorrect to heaven,
    A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
    An understand
ing simple and unschool'd;
    For what we know must be, and is as common
    As any the most vulg
ar thing to sense,
    Why should we in our peevish opposition
    Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a f
ault to heaven,
    A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
    To reason most absurd, whose 
common theme
    Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
    From the first corse till he t
hat died to-day,
    'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth
    This unprevailing woe, and 
think of us
    As of a father; for let the world take note
    You are the most immediate to our 
throne,
    And with no less nobility of love
    Than that which dearest father bears his son
  
  Do I impart toward you. For your intent
    In going back to school in Wittenberg,
    It is mos
t retrograde to our desire;
    And we beseech you, bend you to remain
    Here in the cheer and c
omfort of our eye,
    Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
  Queen. Let not thy mother los
e her prayers, Hamlet.
    I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.
  Ham. I shall in all m
y best obey you, madam.
  King. Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.
    Be as ourself in Denmark.
 Madam, come.
    This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet
    Sits smiling to my heart; in grace
 whereof,
    No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day
    But the great cannon to the clouds s
hall tell,
    And the King's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,
    Respeaking earthly thunder. 
Come away.
                                Flourish. Exeunt all but Hamlet.
  Ham. O that this too
 too solid flesh would melt,
    Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!
    Or that the Everlasting 
had not fix'd
    His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
    How weary, stale, flat, and un
profitable
    Seem to me all the uses of this world!
    Fie on't! ah, fie! 'Tis an unweeded gard
en
    That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
    Possess it merely. That it should c
ome to this!
    But two months dead! Nay, not so much, not two.
    So excellent a king, that was
 to this
    Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
    That he might not beteem the winds of
 heaven
    Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
    Must I remember? Why, she would hang
 on him
    As if increase of appetite had grown
    By what it fed on; and yet, within a month-

    Let me not think on't! Frailty, thy name is woman!-
    A little month, or ere those shoes were
 old
    With which she followed my poor father's body
    Like Niobe, all tears- why she, even sh
e
    (O God! a beast that wants discourse of reason
    Would have mourn'd longer) married with m
y uncle;
    My father's brother, but no more like my father
    Than I to Hercules. Within a mont
h,
    Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
    Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
 
   She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
    With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
    It
 is not, nor it cannot come to good.
    But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue!

        
  Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo.

  Hor. Hail to your lordship!
  Ham. I am glad to see 
you well.
    Horatio!- or I do forget myself.
  Hor. The same, my lord, and your poor servant eve
r.
  Ham. Sir, my good friend- I'll change that name with you.
    And what make you from Wittenbe
rg, Horatio?
    Marcellus?
  Mar. My good lord!
  Ham. I am very glad to see you.- [To Bernardo]
 Good even, sir.-

    But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
  Hor. A truant disposition,
 good my lord.
  Ham. I would not hear your enemy say so,
    Nor shall you do my ear that violenc
e
    To make it truster of your own report
    Against yourself. I know you are no truant.
    B
ut what is your affair in Elsinore?
    We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
  Hor. My lo
rd, I came to see your father's funeral.
  Ham. I prithee do not mock me, fellow student.
    I th
ink it was to see my mother's wedding.
  Hor. Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.
  Ham. Thrif
t, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats
    Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
    
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
    Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
    My father- 
methinks I see my father.
  Hor. O, where, my lord?
  Ham. In my mind's eye, Horatio.
  Hor. I sa
w him once. He was a goodly king.
  Ham. He was a man, take him for all in all.
    I shall not lo
ok upon his like again.
  Hor. My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
  Ham. Saw? who?
  Hor. My
 lord, the King your father.
  Ham. The King my father?
  Hor. Season your admiration for a while

    With an attent ear, till I may deliver
    Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
    This marv
el to you.
  Ham. For God's love let me hear!
  Hor. Two nights together had these gentlemen
    
(Marcellus and Bernardo) on their watch
    In the dead vast and middle of the night
    Been thus
 encount'red. A figure like your father,
    Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
    Appears before 
them and with solemn march
    Goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walk'd
    By their oppres
s'd and fear-surprised eyes,
    Within his truncheon's length; whilst they distill'd
    Almost t
o jelly with the act of fear,
    Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
    In dreadful secr
ecy impart they did,
    And I with them the third night kept the watch;
    Where, as they had de
liver'd, both in time,
    Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
    The apparition com
es. I knew your father.
    These hands are not more like.
  Ham. But where was this?
  Mar. My l
ord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
  Ham. Did you not speak to it?
  Hor. My lord, I did;
 
   But answer made it none. Yet once methought
    It lifted up it head and did address
    Itself
 to motion, like as it would speak;
    But even then the morning cock crew loud,
    And at the s
ound it shrunk in haste away
    And vanish'd from our sight.
  Ham. 'Tis very strange.
  Hor. As
 I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
    And we did think it writ down in our duty
    To let 
you know of it.
  Ham. Indeed, indeed, sirs. But this troubles me.
    Hold you the watch to-night
?
  Both [Mar. and Ber.] We do, my lord.
  Ham. Arm'd, say you?
  Both. Arm'd, my lord.
  Ham. F
rom top to toe?
  Both. My lord, from head to foot.
  Ham. Then saw you not his face?
  Hor. O, y
es, my lord! He wore his beaver up.
  Ham. What, look'd he frowningly.
  Hor. A countenance more i
n sorrow than in anger.
  Ham. Pale or red?
  Hor. Nay, very pale.
  Ham. And fix'd his eyes upon
 you?
  Hor. Most constantly.
  Ham. I would I had been there.
  Hor. It would have much amaz'd y
ou.
  Ham. Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
  Hor. While one with moderate haste might tell a
 hundred.
  Both. Longer, longer.
  Hor. Not when I saw't.
  Ham. His beard was grizzled- no?
  
Hor. It was, as I have seen it in his life,
    A sable silver'd.
  Ham. I will watch to-night.
 
   Perchance 'twill walk again.
  Hor. I warr'nt it will.
  Ham. If it assume my noble father's pe
rson,
    I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
    And bid me hold my peace. I pray yo
u all,
    If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
    Let it be tenable in your silence still;

    And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
    Give it an understanding but no tongue.
    I wi
ll requite your loves. So, fare you well.
    Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
    I'l
l visit you.
  All. Our duty to your honour.
  Ham. Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell.
       
                                 Exeunt [all but Hamlet].
    My father's spirit- in arms? All is n
ot well.
    I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come!
    Till then sit still, my soul. 
Foul deeds will rise,
    Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
Exit.




Scene
 III.
Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius.

Enter Laertes and Ophelia.

  Laer. My necess
aries are embark'd. Farewell.
    And, sister, as the winds give benefit
    And convoy is assista
nt, do not sleep,
    But let me hear from you.
  Oph. Do you doubt that?
  Laer. For Hamlet, and
 the trifling of his favour,
    Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood;
    A violet in the youth 
of primy nature,
    Forward, not permanent- sweet, not lasting;
    The perfume and suppliance of
 a minute;
    No more.
  Oph. No more but so?
  Laer. Think it no more.
    For nature crescent
 does not grow alone
    In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,
    The inward service of th
e mind and soul
    Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
    And now no soil nor cautel do
th besmirch
    The virtue of his will; but you must fear,
    His greatness weigh'd, his will is 
not his own;
    For he himself is subject to his birth.
    He may not, as unvalued persons do,

    Carve for himself, for on his choice depends
    The safety and health of this whole state,
  
  And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd
    Unto the voice and yielding of that body
    
Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
    It fits your wisdom so far to believe it

    As he in his particular act and place
    May give his saying deed; which is no further
    T
han the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
    Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain
    If
 with too credent ear you list his songs,
    Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
   
 To his unmast'red importunity.
    Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
    And keep you in
 the rear of your affection,
    Out of the shot and danger of desire.
    The chariest maid is pr
odigal enough
    If she unmask her beauty to the moon.
    Virtue itself scopes not calumnious st
rokes.
    The canker galls the infants of the spring
    Too oft before their buttons be disclos'
d,
    And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
    Contagious blastments are most imminent.
    B
e wary then; best safety lies in fear.
    Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
  Oph. I
 shall th' effect of this good lesson keep
    As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
    
Do not as some ungracious pastors do,
    Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven,
    Whiles, 
like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
    Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads
    And re
cks not his own rede.
  Laer. O, fear me not!

                       Enter Polonius.

    I st
ay too long. But here my father comes.
    A double blessing is a double grace;
    Occasion smile
s upon a second leave.
  Pol. Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame!
    The wind sits in t
he shoulder of your sail,
    And you are stay'd for. There- my blessing with thee!
    And these 
few precepts in thy memory
    Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
    Nor any unpro
portion'd thought his act.
    Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar:
    Those friends thou ha
st, and their adoption tried,
    Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel;
    But do not d
ull thy palm with entertainment
    Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware
    Of entrance
 to a quarrel; but being in,
    Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee.
    Give every man th
ine ear, but few thy voice;
    Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
    Costly thy 
habit as thy purse can buy,
    But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
    For the apparel o
ft proclaims the man,
    And they in France of the best rank and station
    Are most select and 
generous, chief in that.
    Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
    For loan oft loses both itsel
f and friend,
    And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
    This above all- to thine own self
 be true,
    And it must follow, as the night the day,
    Thou canst not then be false to any ma
n.
    Farewell. My blessing season this in thee!
  Laer. Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.

  Pol. The time invites you. Go, your servants tend.
  Laer. Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well

    What I have said to you.
  Oph. 'Tis in my memory lock'd,
    And you yourself shall keep th
e key of it.
  Laer. Farewell.                                          Exit.
  Pol. What is't, Op
helia, he hath said to you?
  Oph. So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
  Pol. Marry
, well bethought!
    'Tis told me he hath very oft of late
    Given private time to you, and you
 yourself
    Have of your audience been most free and bounteous.
    If it be so- as so 'tis put 
on me,
    And that in way of caution- I must tell you
    You do not understand yourself so clear
ly
    As it behooves my daughter and your honour.
    What is between you? Give me up the truth.

  Oph. He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
    Of his affection to me.
  Pol. Affection? 
Pooh! You speak like a green girl,
    Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
    Do you believe 
his tenders, as you call them?
  Oph. I do not know, my lord, what I should think,
  Pol. Marry, I
 will teach you! Think yourself a baby
    That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
    Whi
ch are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,
    Or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,

    Running it thus) you'll tender me a fool.
  Oph. My lord, he hath importun'd me with love
  
  In honourable fashion.
  Pol. Ay, fashion you may call it. Go to, go to!
  Oph. And hath given c
ountenance to his speech, my lord,
    With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
  Pol. Ay, springe
s to catch woodcocks! I do know,
    When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
    Lends the ton
gue vows. These blazes, daughter,
    Giving more light than heat, extinct in both
    Even in the
ir promise, as it is a-making,
    You must not take for fire. From this time
    Be something sca
nter of your maiden presence.
    Set your entreatments at a higher rate
    Than a command to par
ley. For Lord Hamlet,
    Believe so much in him, that he is young,
    And with a larger tether m
ay he walk
    Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia,
    Do not believe his vows; for they are b
rokers,
    Not of that dye which their investments show,
    But mere implorators of unholy suits
,
    Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
    The better to beguile. This is for all:
    
I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth
    Have you so slander any moment leisure
    A
s to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
    Look to't, I charge you. Come your ways.
  Oph. 
I shall obey, my lord.
                                                         Exeunt.




Sc
ene IV.
Elsinore. The platform before the Castle.

Enter Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus.

  Ham
. The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
  Hor. It is a nipping and an eager air.
  Ham. What ho
ur now?
  Hor. I think it lacks of twelve.
  Mar. No, it is struck.
  Hor. Indeed? I heard it not
. It then draws near the season
    Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
                   A
 flourish of trumpets, and two pieces go off.
    What does this mean, my lord?
  Ham. The King do
th wake to-night and takes his rouse,
    Keeps wassail, and the swagg'ring upspring reels,
    An
d, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
    The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out
    The
 triumph of his pledge.
  Hor. Is it a custom?
  Ham. Ay, marry, is't;
    But to my mind, though
 I am native here
    And to the manner born, it is a custom
    More honour'd in the breach than 
the observance.
    This heavy-headed revel east and west
    Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other
 nations;
    They clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase
    Soil our addition; and indeed it 
takes
    From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
    The pith and marrow of our attrib
ute.
    So oft it chances in particular men
    That, for some vicious mole of nature in them,
 
   As in their birth,- wherein they are not guilty,
    Since nature cannot choose his origin,-
  
  By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
    Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
    O
r by some habit that too much o'erleavens
    The form of plausive manners, that these men
    Car
rying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
    Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,
    Their vir
tues else- be they as pure as grace,
    As infinite as man may undergo-
    Shall in the general 
censure take corruption
    From that particular fault. The dram of e'il
    Doth all the noble su
bstance often dout To his own scandal.

                         Enter Ghost.

  Hor. Look, my l
ord, it comes!
  Ham. Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
    Be thou a spirit of health or g
oblin damn'd,
    Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
    Be thy intents wicked 
or charitable,
    Thou com'st in such a questionable shape
    That I will speak to thee. I'll ca
ll thee Hamlet,
    King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me?
    Let me not burst in ignorance, but
 tell
    Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,
    Have burst their cerements; why the sepul
chre
    Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
    Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws
    To 
cast thee up again. What may this mean
    That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,
    Rev
isits thus the glimpses of the moon,
    Making night hideous, and we fools of nature
    So horri
dly to shake our disposition
    With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
    Say, why is th
is? wherefore? What should we do?
                                           Ghost beckons Hamlet.

  Hor. It beckons you to go away with it,
    As if it some impartment did desire
    To you alon
e.
  Mar. Look with what courteous action
    It waves you to a more removed ground.
    But do n
ot go with it!
  Hor. No, by no means!
  Ham. It will not speak. Then will I follow it.
  Hor. Do
 not, my lord!
  Ham. Why, what should be the fear?
    I do not set my life at a pin's fee;
    
And for my soul, what can it do to that,
    Being a thing immortal as itself?
    It waves me for
th again. I'll follow it.
  Hor. What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
    Or to the dre
adful summit of the cliff
    That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
    And there assume some o
ther, horrible form
    Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
    And draw you into madne
ss? Think of it.
    The very place puts toys of desperation,
    Without more motive, into every 
brain
    That looks so many fadoms to the sea
    And hears it roar beneath.
  Ham. It waves me 
still.
    Go on. I'll follow thee.
  Mar. You shall not go, my lord.
  Ham. Hold off your hands!

  Hor. Be rul'd. You shall not go.
  Ham. My fate cries out
    And makes each petty artire in t
his body
    As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
                                                
[Ghost beckons.]

    Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
    By heaven, I'll make a ghost o
f him that lets me!-
    I say, away!- Go on. I'll follow thee.
                                  
      Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet.
  Hor. He waxes desperate with imagination.
  Mar. Let's follow. 'T
is not fit thus to obey him.
  Hor. Have after. To what issue will this come?
  Mar. Something is 
rotten in the state of Denmark.
  Hor. Heaven will direct it.
  Mar. Nay, let's follow him.
     
                                                    Exeunt.




Scene V.
Elsinore. The Castle.
 Another part of the fortifications.

Enter Ghost and Hamlet.

  Ham. Whither wilt thou lead me?
 Speak! I'll go no further.
  Ghost. Mark me.
  Ham. I will.
  Ghost. My hour is almost come,
  
  When I to sulph'rous and tormenting flames
    Must render up myself.
  Ham. Alas, poor ghost!

  Ghost. Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
    To what I shall unfold.
  Ham. Speak. I am 
bound to hear.
  Ghost. So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
  Ham. What?
  Ghost. I am 
thy father's spirit,
    Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
    And for the day confin'd
 to fast in fires,
    Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
    Are burnt and purg'd awa
y. But that I am forbid
    To tell the secrets of my prison house,
    I could a tale unfold whos
e lightest word
    Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
    Make thy two eyes, like 
stars, start from their spheres,
    Thy knotted and combined locks to part,
    And each particul
ar hair to stand on end
    Like quills upon the fretful porcupine.
    But this eternal blazon mu
st not be
    To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
    If thou didst ever thy dear fat
her love-
  Ham. O God!
  Ghost. Revenge his foul and most unnatural murther.
  Ham. Murther?
  
Ghost. Murther most foul, as in the best it is;
    But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.
  
Ham. Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
    As meditation or the thoughts of love,
  
  May sweep to my revenge.
  Ghost. I find thee apt;
    And duller shouldst thou be than the fat 
weed
    That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
    Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, 
hear.
    'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
    A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of
 Denmark
    Is by a forged process of my death
    Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth,
  
  The serpent that did sting thy father's life
    Now wears his crown.
  Ham. O my prophetic soul
!
    My uncle?
  Ghost. Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
    With witchcraft of his w
it, with traitorous gifts-
    O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
    So to seduce!- won 
to his shameful lust
    The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.
    O Hamlet, what a falling-
off was there,
    From me, whose love was of that dignity
    That it went hand in hand even with
 the vow
    I made to her in marriage, and to decline
    Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were 
poor
    To those of mine!
    But virtue, as it never will be mov'd,
    Though lewdness court i
t in a shape of heaven,
    So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
    Will sate itself in a c
elestial bed
    And prey on garbage.
    But soft! methinks I scent the morning air.
    Brief l
et me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
    My custom always of the afternoon,
    Upon my secure ho
ur thy uncle stole,
    With juice of cursed hebona in a vial,
    And in the porches of my ears d
id pour
    The leperous distilment; whose effect
    Holds such an enmity with blood of man
    
That swift as quicksilver it courses through
    The natural gates and alleys of the body,
    And
 with a sudden vigour it doth posset
    And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
    The thin an
d wholesome blood. So did it mine;
    And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
    Most lazar-like
, with vile and loathsome crust
    All my smooth body.
    Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's h
and
    Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd;
    Cut off even in the blossoms of my si
n,
    Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd,
    No reckoning made, but sent to my account
    With
 all my imperfections on my head.
  Ham. O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
  Ghost. If thou
 hast nature in thee, bear it not.
    Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
    A couch for luxury 
and damned incest.
    But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
    Taint not thy mind, nor let thy 
soul contrive
    Against thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven,
    And to those thorns that in h
er bosom lodge
    To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once.
    The glowworm shows the mati
n to be near
    And gins to pale his uneffectual fire.
    Adieu, adieu, adieu! Remember me.     
                 Exit.

  Ham. O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?
    And shall I coup
le hell? Hold, hold, my heart!
    And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
    But bear me stiff
ly up. Remember thee?
    Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
    In this distracted gl
obe. Remember thee?
    Yea, from the table of my memory
    I'll wipe away all trivial fond recor
ds,
    All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past
    That youth and observation copied the
re,
    And thy commandment all alone shall live
    Within the book and volume of my brain,
    
Unmix'd with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!
    O most pernicious woman!
    O villain, villain, sm
iling, damned villain!
    My tables! Meet it is I set it down
    That one may smile, and smile, 
and be a villain;
    At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark.        [Writes.]
    So, uncle, 
there you are. Now to my word:
    It is 'Adieu, adieu! Remember me.'
    I have sworn't.
  Hor. 
(within) My lord, my lord!

                   Enter Horatio and Marcellus.

  Mar. Lord Hamlet!

  Hor. Heaven secure him!
  Ham. So be it!
  Mar. Illo, ho, ho, my lord!
  Ham. Hillo, ho, ho, 
boy! Come, bird, come.
  Mar. How is't, my noble lord?
  Hor. What news, my lord?
  Mar. O, wonde
rful!
  Hor. Good my lord, tell it.
  Ham. No, you will reveal it.
  Hor. Not I, my lord, by heav
en!
  Mar. Nor I, my lord.
  Ham. How say you then? Would heart of man once think it?
    But you
'll be secret?
  Both. Ay, by heaven, my lord.
  Ham. There's neer a villain dwelling in all Denma
rk
    But he's an arrant knave.
  Hor. There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
    To
 tell us this.
  Ham. Why, right! You are in the right!
    And so, without more circumstance at a
ll,
    I hold it fit that we shake hands and part;
    You, as your business and desires shall po
int you,
    For every man hath business and desire,
    Such as it is; and for my own poor part,

    Look you, I'll go pray.
  Hor. These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
  Ham. I am so
rry they offend you, heartily;
    Yes, faith, heartily.
  Hor. There's no offence, my lord.
  Ha
m. Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
    And much offence too. Touching this vision her
e,
    It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.
    For your desire to know what is between us
,
    O'ermaster't as you may. And now, good friends,
    As you are friends, scholars, and soldie
rs,
    Give me one poor request.
  Hor. What is't, my lord? We will.
  Ham. Never make known wha
t you have seen to-night.
  Both. My lord, we will not.
  Ham. Nay, but swear't.
  Hor. In faith,

    My lord, not I.
  Mar. Nor I, my lord- in faith.
  Ham. Upon my sword.
  Mar. We have sworn
, my lord, already.
  Ham. Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.

                 Ghost cries under the
 stage.

  Ghost. Swear.
  Ham. Aha boy, say'st thou so? Art thou there, truepenny?
    Come on!
 You hear this fellow in the cellarage.
    Consent to swear.
  Hor. Propose the oath, my lord.
 
 Ham. Never to speak of this that you have seen.
    Swear by my sword.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear.

  Ham. Hic et ubique? Then we'll shift our ground.
    Come hither, gentlemen,
    And lay your h
ands again upon my sword.
    Never to speak of this that you have heard:
    Swear by my sword.

  Ghost. [beneath] Swear by his sword.
  Ham. Well said, old mole! Canst work i' th' earth so fast?

    A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends."
  Hor. O day and night, but this is wondrou
s strange!
  Ham. And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
    There are more things in heaven
 and earth, Horatio,
    Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
    But come!
    Here, as before
, never, so help you mercy,
    How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself
    (As I perchance hereaf
ter shall think meet
    To put an antic disposition on),
    That you, at such times seeing me, n
ever shall,
    With arms encumb'red thus, or this head-shake,
    Or by pronouncing of some doubt
ful phrase,
    As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'
    Or 'If we list to spe
ak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'
    Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
    That you know 
aught of me- this is not to do,
    So grace and mercy at your most need help you,
    Swear.
  G
host. [beneath] Swear.
                                                   [They swear.]
  Ham. Res
t, rest, perturbed spirit! So, gentlemen,
    With all my love I do commend me to you;
    And wha
t so poor a man as Hamlet is
    May do t' express his love and friending to you,
    God willing,
 shall not lack. Let us go in together;
    And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
    The t
ime is out of joint. O cursed spite
    That ever I was born to set it right!
    Nay, come, let's
 go together.
                                                         Exeunt.

Act II. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius.

Enter Polonius and Reynaldo.

  P
ol. Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
  Rey. I will, my lord.
  Pol. You shall do mar
vell's wisely, good Reynaldo,
    Before You visit him, to make inquire
    Of his behaviour.
  R
ey. My lord, I did intend it.
  Pol. Marry, well said, very well said. Look you, sir,
    Enquire 
me first what Danskers are in Paris;
    And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
    Wh
at company, at what expense; and finding
    By this encompassment and drift of question
    That 
they do know my son, come you more nearer
    Than your particular demands will touch it.
    Take
 you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
    As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
 
   And in part him.' Do you mark this, Reynaldo?
  Rey. Ay, very well, my lord.
  Pol. 'And in par
t him, but,' you may say, 'not well.
    But if't be he I mean, he's very wild
    Addicted so and
 so'; and there put on him
    What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
    As may dishonour
 him- take heed of that;
    But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips
    As are companions no
ted and most known
    To youth and liberty.
  Rey. As gaming, my lord.
  Pol. Ay, or drinking, f
encing, swearing, quarrelling,
    Drabbing. You may go so far.
  Rey. My lord, that would dishono
ur him.
  Pol. Faith, no, as you may season it in the charge.
    You must not put another scandal
 on him,
    That he is open to incontinency.
    That's not my meaning. But breathe his faults so
 quaintly
    That they may seem the taints of liberty,
    The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind
,
    A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
    Of general assault.
  Rey. But, my good lord-
  Pol
. Wherefore should you do this?
  Rey. Ay, my lord,
    I would know that.
  Pol. Marry, sir, her
e's my drift,
    And I believe it is a fetch of warrant.
    You laying these slight sullies on m
y son
    As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' th' working,
    Mark you,
    Your party in conve
rse, him you would sound,
    Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
    The youth you breathe
 of guilty, be assur'd
    He closes with you in this consequence:
    'Good sir,' or so, or 'frie
nd,' or 'gentleman'-
    According to the phrase or the addition
    Of man and country-
  Rey. V
ery good, my lord.
  Pol. And then, sir, does 'a this- 'a does- What was I about to
say?
    By t
he mass, I was about to say something! Where did I leave?
  Rey. At 'closes in the consequence,' at
 'friend or so,' and
    gentleman.'
  Pol. At 'closes in the consequence'- Ay, marry!
    He clo
ses thus: 'I know the gentleman.
    I saw him yesterday, or t'other day,
    Or then, or then, wi
th such or such; and, as you say,
    There was 'a gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
    There fa
lling out at tennis'; or perchance,
    'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'
    Videlicet, a b
rothel, or so forth.
    See you now-
    Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth;
    An
d thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
    With windlasses and with assays of bias,
    By indirecti
ons find directions out.
    So, by my former lecture and advice,
    Shall you my son. You have m
e, have you not?
  Rey. My lord, I have.
  Pol. God b' wi' ye, fare ye well!
  Rey. Good my lord!
                                    [Going.]
  Pol. Observe his inclination in yourself.
  Rey. I 
shall, my lord.
  Pol. And let him ply his music.
  Rey. Well, my lord.
  Pol. Farewell!
       
                                           Exit Reynaldo.

                       Enter Ophelia.


    How now, Ophelia? What's the matter?
  Oph. O my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
 
 Pol. With what, i' th' name of God?
  Oph. My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
    Lord Hamlet
, with his doublet all unbrac'd,
    No hat upon his head, his stockings foul'd,
    Ungart'red, a
nd down-gyved to his ankle;
    Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,
    And with a l
ook so piteous in purport
    As if he had been loosed out of hell
    To speak of horrors- he com
es before me.
  Pol. Mad for thy love?
  Oph. My lord, I do not know,
    But truly I do fear it.

  Pol. What said he?
  Oph. He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
    Then goes he to the le
ngth of all his arm,
    And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
    He falls to such perusal
 of my face
    As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so.
    At last, a little shaking of mine arm,

    And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
    He rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound
  
  As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
    And end his being. That done, he lets me go,
    And 
with his head over his shoulder turn'd
    He seem'd to find his way without his eyes,
    For out
 o' doors he went without their help
    And to the last bended their light on me.
  Pol. Come, go
 with me. I will go seek the King.
    This is the very ecstasy of love,
    Whose violent propert
y fordoes itself
    And leads the will to desperate undertakings
    As oft as any passion under 
heaven
    That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
    What, have you given him any hard words 
of late?
  Oph. No, my good lord; but, as you did command,
    I did repel his letters and denied

    His access to me.
  Pol. That hath made him mad.
    I am sorry that with better heed and jud
gment
    I had not quoted him. I fear'd he did but trifle
    And meant to wrack thee; but beshre
w my jealousy!
    By heaven, it is as proper to our age
    To cast beyond ourselves in our opini
ons
    As it is common for the younger sort
    To lack discretion. Come, go we to the King.
   
 This must be known; which, being kept close, might move
    More grief to hide than hate to utter 
love.
    Come.
                                                         Exeunt.

Scene II.
Els
inore. A room in the Castle.

Flourish. [Enter King and Queen, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern,
cum 
aliis.

  King. Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
    Moreover that we much did long to
 see you,
    The need we have to use you did provoke
    Our hasty sending. Something have you he
ard
    Of Hamlet's transformation. So I call it,
    Sith nor th' exterior nor the inward man
  
  Resembles that it was. What it should be,
    More than his father's death, that thus hath put hi
m
    So much from th' understanding of himself,
    I cannot dream of. I entreat you both
    Th
at, being of so young days brought up with him,
    And since so neighbour'd to his youth and havio
ur,
    That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
    Some little time; so by your companies

    To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather
    So much as from occasion you may glean,
    Wh
ether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus
    That, open'd, lies within our remedy.
  Queen. Goo
d gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,
    And sure I am two men there are not living
    To who
m he more adheres. If it will please you
    To show us so much gentry and good will
    As to exp
end your time with us awhile
    For the supply and profit of our hope,
    Your visitation shall 
receive such thanks
    As fits a king's remembrance.
  Ros. Both your Majesties
    Might, by th
e sovereign power you have of us,
    Put your dread pleasures more into command
    Than to entre
aty.
  Guil. But we both obey,
    And here give up ourselves, in the full bent,
    To lay our s
ervice freely at your feet,
    To be commanded.
  King. Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenste
rn.
  Queen. Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz.
    And I beseech you instantly to visit

    My too much changed son.- Go, some of you,
    And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
  
Guil. Heavens make our presence and our practices
    Pleasant and helpful to him!
  Queen. Ay, am
en!
                 Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, [with some
                             
                       Attendants].

                         Enter Polonius.

  Pol. Th' ambass
adors from Norway, my good lord,
    Are joyfully return'd.
  King. Thou still hast been the fathe
r of good news.
  Pol. Have I, my lord? Assure you, my good liege,
    I hold my duty as I hold my
 soul,
    Both to my God and to my gracious king;
    And I do think- or else this brain of mine

    Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
    As it hath us'd to do- that I have found
    The ve
ry cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
  King. O, speak of that! That do I long to hear.
  Pol. Give first a
dmittance to th' ambassadors.
    My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
  King. Thyself 
do grace to them, and bring them in.
                                                [Exit Polonius
.]
    He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found
    The head and source of all your son's dist
emper.
  Queen. I doubt it is no other but the main,
    His father's death and our o'erhasty marr
iage.
  King. Well, we shall sift him.

              Enter Polonius, Voltemand, and Cornelius.


    Welcome, my good friends.
    Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?
  Volt. Most fai
r return of greetings and desires.
    Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
    His nephew's le
vies; which to him appear'd
    To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack,
    But better look'd into
, he truly found
    It was against your Highness; whereat griev'd,
    That so his sickness, age,
 and impotence
    Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
    On Fortinbras; which he, in br
ief, obeys,
    Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,
    Makes vow before his uncle never mo
re
    To give th' assay of arms against your Majesty.
    Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,

    Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee
    And his commission to employ those soldiers,

    So levied as before, against the Polack;
    With an entreaty, herein further shown,
       
                                         [Gives a paper.]
    That it might please you to give quie
t pass
    Through your dominions for this enterprise,
    On such regards of safety and allowance

    As therein are set down.
  King. It likes us well;
    And at our more consider'd time we'll
 read,
    Answer, and think upon this business.
    Meantime we thank you for your well-took labo
ur.
    Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together.
    Most welcome home!                    
   Exeunt Ambassadors.
  Pol. This business is well ended.
    My liege, and madam, to expostulate

    What majesty should be, what duty is,
    Why day is day, night is night, and time is time.

    Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time.
    Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit
,
    And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
    I will be brief. Your noble son is mad
.
    Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,
    What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
 
   But let that go.
  Queen. More matter, with less art.
  Pol. Madam, I swear I use no art at all
.
    That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
    And pity 'tis 'tis true. A foolish figur
e!
    But farewell it, for I will use no art.
    Mad let us grant him then. And now remains
   
 That we find out the cause of this effect-
    Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
    For t
his effect defective comes by cause.
    Thus it remains, and the remainder thus.
    Perpend.
  
  I have a daughter (have while she is mine),
    Who in her duty and obedience, mark,
    Hath gi
ven me this. Now gather, and surmise.
                                             [Reads] the lett
er.
    'To the celestial, and my soul's idol, the most beautified
      Ophelia,'-

    That's 
an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is a vile
      phrase.
    But you shall hear. Thus:

                                                        [Reads.]
    'In her excellent white bosom,
 these, &c.'
  Queen. Came this from Hamlet to her?
  Pol. Good madam, stay awhile. I will be fait
hful.     [Reads.]


          'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
            Doubt that the sun do
th move;
          Doubt truth to be a liar;
            But never doubt I love.
      'O dear Op
helia, I am ill at these numbers; I have not art
to
    reckon my groans; but that I love thee bes
t, O most best,
believe
    it. Adieu.
      'Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine
 is to
him,

HAMLET.'

    This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me;
    And more above, 
hath his solicitings,
    As they fell out by time, by means, and place,
    All given to mine ear
.
  King. But how hath she
    Receiv'd his love?
  Pol. What do you think of me?
  King. As of 
a man faithful and honourable.
  Pol. I would fain prove so. But what might you think,
    When I 
had seen this hot love on the wing
    (As I perceiv'd it, I must tell you that,
    Before my dau
ghter told me), what might you,
    Or my dear Majesty your queen here, think,
    If I had play'd
 the desk or table book,
    Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
    Or look'd upon this l
ove with idle sight?
    What might you think? No, I went round to work
    And my young mistress 
thus I did bespeak:
    'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star.
    This must not be.' And then
 I prescripts gave her,
    That she should lock herself from his resort,
    Admit no messengers,
 receive no tokens.
    Which done, she took the fruits of my advice,
    And he, repulsed, a shor
t tale to make,
    Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
    Thence to a watch, thence into a we
akness,
    Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
    Into the madness wherein now he ra
ves,
    And all we mourn for.
  King. Do you think 'tis this?
  Queen. it may be, very like.
  
Pol. Hath there been such a time- I would fain know that-
    That I have Positively said ''Tis so,
'
    When it prov'd otherwise.?
  King. Not that I know.
  Pol. [points to his head and shoulder
] Take this from this, if
this
      be otherwise.
    If circumstances lead me, I will find
   
 Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
    Within the centre.
  King. How may we try it fu
rther?
  Pol. You know sometimes he walks for hours together
    Here in the lobby.
  Queen. So h
e does indeed.
  Pol. At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him.
    Be you and I behind an arr
as then.
    Mark the encounter. If he love her not,
    And he not from his reason fall'n thereon

    Let me be no assistant for a state,
    But keep a farm and carters.
  King. We will try it.


                 Enter Hamlet, reading on a book.

  Queen. But look where sadly the poor wret
ch comes reading.
  Pol. Away, I do beseech you, both away
    I'll board him presently. O, give m
e leave.
                       Exeunt King and Queen, [with Attendants].
    How does my good Lor
d Hamlet?
  Ham. Well, God-a-mercy.
  Pol. Do you know me, my lord?
  Ham. Excellent well. You ar
e a fishmonger.
  Pol. Not I, my lord.
  Ham. Then I would you were so honest a man.
  Pol. Hones
t, my lord?
  Ham. Ay, sir. To be honest, as this world goes, is to be one
man
    pick'd out of 
ten thousand.
  Pol. That's very true, my lord.
  Ham. For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog,
 being a god
    kissing carrion- Have you a daughter?
  Pol. I have, my lord.
  Ham. Let her not
 walk i' th' sun. Conception is a blessing, but
not
    as your daughter may conceive. Friend, loo
k to't.
  Pol. [aside] How say you by that? Still harping on my daughter.
Yet
    he knew me not 
at first. He said I was a fishmonger. He is
far
    gone, far gone! And truly in my youth I suff'r
ed much
extremity
    for love- very near this. I'll speak to him again.- What do
you
    read, 
my lord?
  Ham. Words, words, words.
  Pol. What is the matter, my lord?
  Ham. Between who?
  P
ol. I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
  Ham. Slanders, sir; for the satirical rogue says h
ere that old
men
    have grey beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes
    purging thic
k amber and plum-tree gum; and that they have a
    plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak 
hams. All
which,
    sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I
hold it
    not h
onesty to have it thus set down; for you yourself, sir,
    should be old as I am if, like a crab, 
you could go backward.

  Pol. [aside] Though this be madness, yet there is a method
in't.-
   W
ill You walk out of the air, my lord?
  Ham. Into my grave?
  Pol. Indeed, that is out o' th' air.
 [Aside] How pregnant
sometimes
    his replies are! a happiness that often madness hits on,
whic
h
    reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of.
I
    will leave him and sudde
nly contrive the means of meeting
between
    him and my daughter.- My honourable lord, I will mos
t humbly
take
    my leave of you.
  Ham. You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more

    willingly part withal- except my life, except my life, except
my
    life,

              
      Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Pol. Fare you well, my lord.
  Ham. These tedious ol
d fools!
  Pol. You go to seek the Lord Hamlet. There he is.
  Ros. [to Polonius] God save you, si
r!
                                                Exit [Polonius].

  Guil. My honour'd lord!
 
 Ros. My most dear lord!
  Ham. My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern?
Ah,
    R
osencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
  Ros. As the indifferent children of the earth.
  Guil. Ha
ppy in that we are not over-happy.
    On Fortune's cap we are not the very button.
  Ham. Nor the
 soles of her shoe?
  Ros. Neither, my lord.
  Ham. Then you live about her waist, or in the middl
e of her
    favours?
  Guil. Faith, her privates we.
  Ham. In the secret parts of Fortune? O! m
ost true! she is a
    strumpet. What news ?
  Ros. None, my lord, but that the world's grown hone
st.
  Ham. Then is doomsday near! But your news is not true. Let me
    question more in particula
r. What have you, my good friends,
    deserved at the hands of Fortune that she sends you to priso
n
    hither?
  Guil. Prison, my lord?
  Ham. Denmark's a prison.
  Ros. Then is the world one.

  Ham. A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and
    dungeons, Denmark being one 
o' th' worst.
  Ros. We think not so, my lord.
  Ham. Why, then 'tis none to you; for there is not
hing either
good
    or bad but thinking makes it so. To me it is a prison.
  Ros. Why, then your
 ambition makes it one. 'Tis too narrow for
your
    mind.
  Ham. O God, I could be bounded in a 
nutshell and count myself a
    king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.
  Guil
. Which dreams indeed are ambition; for the very substance
of
    the ambitious is merely the shad
ow of a dream.
  Ham. A dream itself is but a shadow.
  Ros. Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy
 and light a quality
that
    it is but a shadow's shadow.
  Ham. Then are our beggars bodies, an
d our monarchs and
outstretch'd
    heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we to th' court? for, by
m
y
    fay, I cannot reason.
  Both. We'll wait upon you.
  Ham. No such matter! I will not sort y
ou with the rest of my
    servants; for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most
    dreadf
ully attended. But in the beaten way of friendship,
what
    make you at Elsinore?
  Ros. To visi
t you, my lord; no other occasion.
  Ham. Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank

you;
    and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny.
Were
    you not sent for? I
s it your own inclining? Is it a free
    visitation? Come, deal justly with me. Come, come! Nay,

speak.
  Guil. What should we say, my lord?
  Ham. Why, anything- but to th' purpose. You were sen
t for; and
    there is a kind of confession in your looks, which your
modesties
    have not cra
ft enough to colour. I know the good King and
Queen
    have sent for you.
  Ros. To what end, my
 lord?
  Ham. That you must teach me. But let me conjure you by the
rights
    of our fellowship,
 by the consonancy of our youth, by the
    obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more
 dear
a
    better proposer could charge you withal, be even and direct
with
    me, whether you
 were sent for or no.
  Ros. [aside to Guildenstern] What say you?
  Ham. [aside] Nay then, I have
 an eye of you.- If you love me,
hold
    not off.
  Guil. My lord, we were sent for.
  Ham. I w
ill tell you why. So shall my anticipation prevent your
    discovery, and your secrecy to the King
 and Queen moult no
    feather. I have of late- but wherefore I know not- lost all
my
    mirth,
 forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes
so
    heavily with my disposition that this
 goodly frame, the
earth,
    seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy,
the

    air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this
majestical
    roof fretted with golden 
fire- why, it appeareth no other
thing
    to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours
. What
a
    piece of work is a man! how noble in reason! how infinite in
    faculties! in form 
and moving how express and admirable! in
    action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a g
od! the
    beauty of the world, the paragon of animals! And yet to me
what
    is this quintesse
nce of dust? Man delights not me- no, nor
woman
    neither, though by your smiling you seem to sa
y so.
  Ros. My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.
  Ham. Why did you laugh then, when 
I said 'Man delights not me'?
  Ros. To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten
   
 entertainment the players shall receive from you. We coted
them
    on the way, and hither are th
ey coming to offer you service.
  Ham. He that plays the king shall be welcome- his Majesty shall

    have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil
and
    target; the lover shall 
not sigh gratis; the humorous man
shall
    end his part in peace; the clown shall make those laug
h whose
    lungs are tickle o' th' sere; and the lady shall say her mind
    freely, or the blank
 verse shall halt for't. What players are
    they?
  Ros. Even those you were wont to take such d
elight in, the
    tragedians of the city.
  Ham. How chances it they travel? Their residence, bot
h in
    reputation and profit, was better both ways.
  Ros. I think their inhibition comes by the
 means of the late
    innovation.
  Ham. Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in

the
    city? Are they so follow'd?
  Ros. No indeed are they not.
  Ham. How comes it? Do they 
grow rusty?
  Ros. Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there
is,
    sir, an eyrie
 of children, little eyases, that cry out on the
top
    of question and are most tyrannically cla
pp'd for't. These
are now
    the fashion, and so berattle the common stages (so they call
    th
em) that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goosequills and
    dare scarce come thither.
  Ham. W
hat, are they children? Who maintains 'em? How are they
    escoted? Will they pursue the quality n
o longer than they can
    sing? Will they not say afterwards, if they should grow
    themselves 
to common players (as it is most like, if their
means
    are no better), their writers do them wr
ong to make them
exclaim
    against their own succession.
  Ros. Faith, there has been much to d
o on both sides; and the
nation
    holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy. There was, for

a
    while, no money bid for argument unless the poet and the
player
    went to cuffs in the qu
estion.
  Ham. Is't possible?
  Guil. O, there has been much throwing about of brains.
  Ham. Do 
the boys carry it away?
  Ros. Ay, that they do, my lord- Hercules and his load too.
  Ham. It is 
not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark,
and
    those that would make mows at him while
 my father lived give
    twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his picture
in
    li
ttle. 'Sblood, there is something in this more than
natural, if
    philosophy could find it out.


                     Flourish for the Players.

  Guil. There are the players.
  Ham. Gentleme
n, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come!
Th'
    appurtenance of welcome is fashion and c
eremony. Let me
comply
    with you in this garb, lest my extent to the players (which I
    tell
 you must show fairly outwards) should more appear like
    entertainment than yours. You are welco
me. But my
uncle-father
    and aunt-mother are deceiv'd.
  Guil. In what, my dear lord?
  Ham. 
I am but mad north-north-west. When the wind is southerly
I
    know a hawk from a handsaw.

   
                         Enter Polonius.

  Pol. Well be with you, gentlemen!
  Ham. Hark you, Gu
ildenstern- and you too- at each ear a hearer!
    That great baby you see there is not yet out of 
his swaddling
    clouts.
  Ros. Happily he's the second time come to them; for they say an
old

    man is twice a child.
  Ham. I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players. Mark
it.-
  
 You say right, sir; a Monday morning; twas so indeed.
  Pol. My lord, I have news to tell you.
  
Ham. My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an
actor in
    Rome-
  Pol. The actors a
re come hither, my lord.
  Ham. Buzz, buzz!
  Pol. Upon my honour-
  Ham. Then came each actor on
 his ass-
  Pol. The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy,
    history, pastoral, 
pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral,
    tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastora
l;
scene
    individable, or poem unlimited. Seneca cannot be too heavy,
nor
    Plautus too lig
ht. For the law of writ and the liberty, these
are
    the only men.
  Ham. O Jephthah, judge of 
Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
  Pol. What treasure had he, my lord?
  Ham. Why,

         
'One fair daughter, and no more,
           The which he loved passing well.'

  Pol. [aside] Sti
ll on my daughter.
  Ham. Am I not i' th' right, old Jephthah?
  Pol. If you call me Jephthah, my 
lord, I have a daughter that I
    love passing well.
  Ham. Nay, that follows not.
  Pol. What f
ollows then, my lord?
  Ham. Why,

           'As by lot, God wot,'

 and then, you know,

  
         'It came to pass, as most like it was.'

    The first row of the pious chanson will show
 you more; for
look
    where my abridgment comes.

                     Enter four or five Play
ers.

    You are welcome, masters; welcome, all.- I am glad to see
thee
    well.- Welcome, goo
d friends.- O, my old friend? Why, thy
face is
    valanc'd since I saw thee last. Com'st' thou to
' beard me in
    Denmark?- What, my young lady and mistress? By'r Lady, your
    ladyship is near
er to heaven than when I saw you last by the
    altitude of a chopine. Pray God your voice, like a
 piece of
    uncurrent gold, be not crack'd within the ring.- Masters, you
are
    all welcome. 
We'll e'en to't like French falconers, fly at
    anything we see. We'll have a speech straight. Co
me, give us
a
    taste of your quality. Come, a passionate speech.
  1. Play. What speech, my go
od lord?
  Ham. I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never
acted;
    or if it was, no
t above once; for the play, I remember,
pleas'd
    not the million, 'twas caviary to the general;
 but it was (as
I
    receiv'd it, and others, whose judgments in such matters
cried in
    the 
top of mine) an excellent play, well digested in the
scenes,
    set down with as much modesty as 
cunning. I remember one said
    there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter
savoury,
 
   nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of
    affectation; but call'd it an ho
nest method, as wholesome as
    sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech
in't

    I chiefly lov'd. 'Twas AEneas' tale to Dido, and thereabout
of it
    especially where he spe
aks of Priam's slaughter. If it live
in
    your memory, begin at this line- let me see, let me se
e:

         'The rugged Pyrrhus, like th' Hyrcanian beast-'

    'Tis not so; it begins with Py
rrhus:

         'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
         Black as his purpose, did the
 night resemble
         When he lay couched in the ominous horse,
         Hath now this dread an
d black complexion smear'd
         With heraldry more dismal. Head to foot
         Now is be tot
al gules, horridly trick'd
         With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
         Bak'
d and impasted with the parching streets,
         That lend a tyrannous and a damned light
      
   To their lord's murther. Roasted in wrath and fire,
         And thus o'ersized with coagulate g
ore,
         With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
         Old grandsire Priam seeks.'


    So, proceed you.
  Pol. Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good
     disc
retion.

  1. Play. 'Anon he finds him,
      Striking too short at Greeks. His antique sword,
 
     Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
      Repugnant to command. Unequal match'd,
    
  Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide;
      But with the whiff and wind of his fell swor
d
      Th' unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
      Seeming to feel this blow, with fla
ming top
      Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
      Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear. For
 lo! his sword,
      Which was declining on the milky head
      Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' th'
 air to stick.
      So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
      And, like a neutral to his will
 and matter,
      Did nothing.
      But, as we often see, against some storm,
      A silence i
n the heavens, the rack stand still,
      The bold winds speechless, and the orb below
      As h
ush as death- anon the dreadful thunder
      Doth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
    
  Aroused vengeance sets him new awork;
      And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
      On Mar
s's armour, forg'd for proof eterne,
      With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
      No
w falls on Priam.
      Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods,
      In general synod take
 away her power;
      Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
      And bowl the round n
ave down the hill of heaven,
      As low as to the fiends!

  Pol. This is too long.
  Ham. It 
shall to the barber's, with your beard.- Prithee say
on.
    He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, o
r he sleeps. Say on;
come to
    Hecuba.

  1. Play. 'But who, O who, had seen the mobled queen-
'

  Ham. 'The mobled queen'?
  Pol. That's good! 'Mobled queen' is good.

  1. Play. 'Run bare
foot up and down, threat'ning the flames
      With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head
      Whe
re late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
      About her lank and all o'erteemed loins,
      A b
lanket, in the alarm of fear caught up-
      Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd
    
  'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have pronounc'd.
      But if the gods themselves did see h
er then,
      When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
      In Mincing with his sword her husba
nd's limbs,
      The instant burst of clamour that she made
      (Unless things mortal move them
 not at all)
      Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven
      And passion in the gods.
'

  Pol. Look, whe'r he has not turn'd his colour, and has tears
in's
    eyes. Prithee no more
!
  Ham. 'Tis well. I'll have thee speak out the rest of this
soon.-
    Good my lord, will you s
ee the players well bestow'd? Do you
    hear? Let them be well us'd; for they are the abstract and

brief
    chronicles of the time. After your death you were better have
a
    bad epitaph than 
their ill report while you live.
  Pol. My lord, I will use them according to their desert.
  Ham.
 God's bodykins, man, much better! Use every man after his
    desert, and who should scape whippin
g? Use them after your
own
    honour and dignity. The less they deserve, the more merit is
in
 
   your bounty. Take them in.
  Pol. Come, sirs.
  Ham. Follow him, friends. We'll hear a play to-
morrow.
                 Exeunt Polonius and Players [except the First].
    Dost thou hear me, ol
d friend? Can you play 'The Murther of
    Gonzago'?
  1. Play. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. We'll ha't to
-morrow night. You could, for a need, study a
    speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which I wou
ld set down
and
    insert in't, could you not?
  1. Play. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Very well. Follow
 that lord- and look you mock him not.
                                            [Exit First Play
er.]
    My good friends, I'll leave you till night. You are welcome
to
    Elsinore.
  Ros. Goo
d my lord!
  Ham. Ay, so, God b' wi' ye!
                            [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guild
enstern
    Now I am alone.
    O what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
    Is it not monstrous th
at this player here,
    But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
    Could force his soul so to h
is own conceit
    That, from her working, all his visage wann'd,
    Tears in his eyes, distracti
on in's aspect,
    A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
    With forms to his conceit? 
And all for nothing!
    For Hecuba!
    What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
    That he shoul
d weep for her? What would he do,
    Had he the motive and the cue for passion
    That I have? H
e would drown the stage with tears
    And cleave the general ear with horrid speech;
    Make mad
 the guilty and appal the free,
    Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed
    The very faculties
 of eyes and ears.
    Yet I,
    A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak
    Like John-a-dreams, u
npregnant of my cause,
    And can say nothing! No, not for a king,
    Upon whose property and mo
st dear life
    A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
    Who calls me villain? breaks my pate
 across?
    Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?
    Tweaks me by th' nose? gives me the 
lie i' th' throat
    As deep as to the lungs? Who does me this, ha?
    'Swounds, I should take i
t! for it cannot be
    But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall
    To make oppression bitter, or er
e this
    I should have fatted all the region kites
    With this slave's offal. Bloody bawdy vil
lain!
    Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
    O, vengeance!
    Why, what 
an ass am I! This is most brave,
    That I, the son of a dear father murther'd,
    Prompted to m
y revenge by heaven and hell,
    Must (like a whore) unpack my heart with words
    And fall a-cu
rsing like a very drab,
    A scullion!
    Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! Hum, I have heard
 
   That guilty creatures, sitting at a play,
    Have by the very cunning of the scene
    Been st
ruck so to the soul that presently
    They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
    For murther, t
hough it have no tongue, will speak
    With most miraculous organ, I'll have these Players
    Pl
ay something like the murther of my father
    Before mine uncle. I'll observe his looks;
    I'll
 tent him to the quick. If he but blench,
    I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
    Ma
y be a devil; and the devil hath power
    T' assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
    Out of
 my weakness and my melancholy,
    As he is very potent with such spirits,
    Abuses me to damn 
me. I'll have grounds
    More relative than this. The play's the thing
    Wherein I'll catch the
 conscience of the King.         Exit.

ACT III. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in t
he Castle.

Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern,
and Lords.

  King
. And can you by no drift of circumstance
    Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
    Grat
ing so harshly all his days of quiet
    With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
  Ros. He does confe
ss he feels himself distracted,
    But from what cause he will by no means speak.
  Guil. Nor do 
we find him forward to be sounded,
    But with a crafty madness keeps aloof
    When we would bri
ng him on to some confession
    Of his true state.
  Queen. Did he receive you well?
  Ros. Most
 like a gentleman.
  Guil. But with much forcing of his disposition.
  Ros. Niggard of question, b
ut of our demands
    Most free in his reply.
  Queen. Did you assay him
    To any pastime?
  R
os. Madam, it so fell out that certain players
    We o'erraught on the way. Of these we told him,

    And there did seem in him a kind of joy
    To hear of it. They are here about the court,
   
 And, as I think, they have already order
    This night to play before him.
  Pol. 'Tis most true
;
    And he beseech'd me to entreat your Majesties
    To hear and see the matter.
  King. With 
all my heart, and it doth much content me
    To hear him so inclin'd.
    Good gentlemen, give hi
m a further edge
    And drive his purpose on to these delights.
  Ros. We shall, my lord.
      
                      Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
  King. Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
 
   For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
    That he, as 'twere by accident, may here
    Af
front Ophelia.
    Her father and myself (lawful espials)
    Will so bestow ourselves that, seein
g unseen,
    We may of their encounter frankly judge
    And gather by him, as he is behav'd,
  
  If't be th' affliction of his love, or no,
    That thus he suffers for.
  Queen. I shall obey y
ou;
    And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
    That your good beauties be the happy cause
    
Of Hamlet's wildness. So shall I hope your virtues
    Will bring him to his wonted way again,
   
 To both your honours.
  Oph. Madam, I wish it may.
                                              
     [Exit Queen.]
  Pol. Ophelia, walk you here.- Gracious, so please you,
    We will bestow our
selves.- [To Ophelia] Read on this book,
    That show of such an exercise may colour
    Your lon
eliness.- We are oft to blame in this,
    'Tis too much prov'd, that with devotion's visage
    A
nd pious action we do sugar o'er
    The Devil himself.
  King. [aside] O, 'tis too true!
    How
 smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
    The harlot's cheek, beautied with plast'ring
 art,
    Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
    Than is my deed to my most painted word.

    O heavy burthen!
  Pol. I hear him coming. Let's withdraw, my lord.
                        
              Exeunt King and Polonius].

                           Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. To be
, or not to be- that is the question:
    Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
    The slings
 and arrows of outrageous fortune
    Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
    And by opposi
ng end them. To die- to sleep-
    No more; and by a sleep to say we end
    The heartache, and th
e thousand natural shocks
    That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation
    Devoutly to be wish'd
. To die- to sleep.
    To sleep- perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub!
    For in that sleep o
f death what dreams may come
    When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
    Must give us paus
e. There's the respect
    That makes calamity of so long life.
    For who would bear the whips a
nd scorns of time,
    Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
    The pangs of despis'd
 love, the law's delay,
    The insolence of office, and the spurns
    That patient merit of th' 
unworthy takes,
    When he himself might his quietus make
    With a bare bodkin? Who would these
 fardels bear,
    To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
    But that the dread of something afte
r death-
    The undiscover'd country, from whose bourn
    No traveller returns- puzzles the will
,
    And makes us rather bear those ills we have
    Than fly to others that we know not of?
   
 Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
    And thus the native hue of resolution
    Is sic
klied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
    And enterprises of great pith and moment
    With th
is regard their currents turn awry
    And lose the name of action.- Soft you now!
    The fair Op
helia!- Nymph, in thy orisons
    Be all my sins rememb'red.
  Oph. Good my lord,
    How does yo
ur honour for this many a day?
  Ham. I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
  Oph. My lord, I have
 remembrances of yours
    That I have longed long to re-deliver.
    I pray you, now receive them
.
  Ham. No, not I!
    I never gave you aught.
  Oph. My honour'd lord, you know right well you 
did,
    And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd
    As made the things more rich. Their p
erfume lost,
    Take these again; for to the noble mind
    Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove
 unkind.
    There, my lord.
  Ham. Ha, ha! Are you honest?
  Oph. My lord?
  Ham. Are you fair?

  Oph. What means your lordship?
  Ham. That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit

no
    discourse to your beauty.
  Oph. Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with
h
onesty?
  Ham. Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform
    honesty from what it i
s to a bawd than the force of honesty
can
    translate beauty into his likeness. This was sometim
e a
paradox,
    but now the time gives it proof. I did love you once.
  Oph. Indeed, my lord, yo
u made me believe so.
  Ham. You should not have believ'd me; for virtue cannot so
    inoculate o
ur old stock but we shall relish of it. I loved
you
    not.
  Oph. I was the more deceived.
  H
am. Get thee to a nunnery! Why wouldst thou be a breeder of
    sinners? I am myself indifferent ho
nest, but yet I could
accuse
    me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne
me
.
    I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more offences at
my
    beck than I have thoug
hts to put them in, imagination to give
    them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fe
llows
as I
    do, crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves
all;
    believe none
 of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where's your
    father?
  Oph. At home, my lord.
  Ham. Let th
e doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool
    nowhere but in's own house. Farewell.
  Op
h. O, help him, you sweet heavens!
  Ham. If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy
d
owry:
    be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not
escape
    calumny. Get thee 
to a nunnery. Go, farewell. Or if thou wilt
    needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well e
nough what
    monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go; and quickly too.
    Farewell.
  Oph.
 O heavenly powers, restore him!
  Ham. I have heard of your paintings too, well enough. God hath

    given you one face, and you make yourselves another. You jig,
you
    amble, and you lisp; you
 nickname God's creatures and make
your
    wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't! i
t hath
made
    me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages. Those that are
    married already
- all but one- shall live; the rest shall keep
as
    they are. To a nunnery, go.                 
           Exit.
  Oph. O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
    The courtier's, scholar's, so
ldier's, eye, tongue, sword,
    Th' expectancy and rose of the fair state,
    The glass of fashi
on and the mould of form,
    Th' observ'd of all observers- quite, quite down!
    And I, of ladi
es most deject and wretched,
    That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
    Now see that noble a
nd most sovereign reason,
    Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
    That unmatch'd 
form and feature of blown youth
    Blasted with ecstasy. O, woe is me
    T' have seen what I hav
e seen, see what I see!

                   Enter King and Polonius.

  King. Love? his affectio
ns do not that way tend;
    Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,
    Was not like m
adness. There's something in his soul
    O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
    And I do do
ubt the hatch and the disclose
    Will be some danger; which for to prevent,
    I have in quick 
determination
    Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England
    For the demand of our negle
cted tribute.
    Haply the seas, and countries different,
    With variable objects, shall expel

    This something-settled matter in his heart,
    Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus

    From fashion of himself. What think you on't?
  Pol. It shall do well. But yet do I believe

    The origin and commencement of his grief
    Sprung from neglected love.- How now, Ophelia?
  
  You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said.
    We heard it all.- My lord, do as you please;
   
 But if you hold it fit, after the play
    Let his queen mother all alone entreat him
    To show
 his grief. Let her be round with him;
    And I'll be plac'd so please you, in the ear
    Of all
 their conference. If she find him not,
    To England send him; or confine him where
    Your wis
dom best shall think.
  King. It shall be so.
    Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.    
     Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. hall in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet and three of the Play
ers.

  Ham. Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounc'd it to you,
    trippingly on the tongu
e. But if you mouth it, as many of our
    players do, I had as live the town crier spoke my lines.
 Nor
do
    not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all
    gently; for in the ver
y torrent, tempest, and (as I may say)
    whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and beget a

    temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to
the
    soul to hear a robustious
 periwig-pated fellow tear a passion
to
    tatters, to very rags, to split the cars of the ground
lings,
who
    (for the most part) are capable of nothing but inexplicable
dumb
    shows and no
ise. I would have such a fellow whipp'd for
o'erdoing
    Termagant. It out-herods Herod. Pray you
 avoid it.
  Player. I warrant your honour.
  Ham. Be not too tame neither; but let your own discr
etion be
your
    tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the action;
with
    this spec
ial observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of
    nature: for anything so overdone is from t
he purpose of
playing,
    whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as
    'twe
re, the mirror up to nature; to show Virtue her own
feature,
    scorn her own image, and the very
 age and body of the time
his
    form and pressure. Now this overdone, or come tardy off,
though

    it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious
    grieve; the censure of the whi
ch one must in your allowance
    o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that
I

    have seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly (not
to
    speak it profanely), tha
t, neither having the accent of
    Christians, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have
so

    strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of Nature's
    journeymen had made men, and n
ot made them well, they
imitated
    humanity so abominably.
  Player. I hope we have reform'd th
at indifferently with us,
sir.
  Ham. O, reform it altogether! And let those that play your
clown
s
    speak no more than is set down for them. For there be of them
    that will themselves laugh
, to set on some quantity of barren
    spectators to laugh too, though in the mean time some
nece
ssary
    question of the play be then to be considered. That's
villanous
    and shows a most pi
tiful ambition in the fool that uses it.
Go
    make you ready.
                                 
                Exeunt Players.

            Enter Polonius, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.

   
 How now, my lord? Will the King hear this piece of work?
  Pol. And the Queen too, and that presen
tly.
  Ham. Bid the players make haste, [Exit Polonius.] Will you two
    help to hasten them?
  
Both. We will, my lord.                       Exeunt they two.
  Ham. What, ho, Horatio!

       
               Enter Horatio.

  Hor. Here, sweet lord, at your service.
  Ham. Horatio, thou art
 e'en as just a man
    As e'er my conversation cop'd withal.
  Hor. O, my dear lord!
  Ham. Nay,
 do not think I flatter;
    For what advancement may I hope from thee,
    That no revenue hast b
ut thy good spirits
    To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
    No, let the
 candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
    And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
    Where thrift m
ay follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
    Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
    And could
 of men distinguish, her election
    Hath seal'd thee for herself. For thou hast been
    As one,
 in suff'ring all, that suffers nothing;
    A man that Fortune's buffets and rewards
    Hast ta'
en with equal thanks; and blest are those
    Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled
    
That they are not a pipe for Fortune's finger
    To sound what stop she please. Give me that man

    That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
    In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of hea
rt,
    As I do thee. Something too much of this I
    There is a play to-night before the King.

    One scene of it comes near the circumstance,
    Which I have told thee, of my father's death.

    I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
    Even with the very comment of thy soul
    Obs
erve my uncle. If his occulted guilt
    Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
    It is a damned 
ghost that we have seen,
    And my imaginations are as foul
    As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heed
ful note;
    For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,
    And after we will both our judgments joi
n
    In censure of his seeming.
  Hor. Well, my lord.
    If he steal aught the whilst this play
 is playing,
    And scape detecting, I will pay the theft.

    Sound a flourish. [Enter Trumpet
s and Kettledrums. Danish
    march. [Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz,
      Gui
ldenstern, and other Lords attendant, with the Guard
                       carrying torches.

  
Ham. They are coming to the play. I must be idle.
    Get you a place.
  King. How fares our cousi
n Hamlet?
  Ham. Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish. I eat the
air,
    promise-cramm'd
. You cannot feed capons so.
  King. I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet. These words are
not

    mine.
  Ham. No, nor mine now. [To Polonius] My lord, you play'd once
    i' th' university, 
you say?
  Pol. That did I, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.
  Ham. What did you enact?
 
 Pol. I did enact Julius Caesar; I was kill'd i' th' Capitol;
Brutus
    kill'd me.
  Ham. It was
 a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf
there. Be
    the players ready.
  Ros. Ay, my lor
d. They stay upon your patience.
  Queen. Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
  Ham. No, good 
mother. Here's metal more attractive.
  Pol. [to the King] O, ho! do you mark that?
  Ham. Lady, s
hall I lie in your lap?
                                  [Sits down at Ophelia's feet.]

  Oph. 
No, my lord.
  Ham. I mean, my head upon your lap?
  Oph. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Do you think I mean
t country matters?
  Oph. I think nothing, my lord.
  Ham. That's a fair thought to lie between ma
ids' legs.
  Oph. What is, my lord?
  Ham. Nothing.
  Oph. You are merry, my lord.
  Ham. Who, I
?
  Oph. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. O God, your only jig-maker! What should a man do but be
merry?
    
For look you how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father
died
    within 's two hours.
  Oph. N
ay 'tis twice two months, my lord.
  Ham. So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I'll hav
e
a
    suit of sables. O heavens! die two months ago, and not
forgotten
    yet? Then there's h
ope a great man's memory may outlive his
life
    half a year. But, by'r Lady, he must build churc
hes then; or
else
    shall he suffer not thinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose

    epitaph 
is 'For O, for O, the hobby-horse is forgot!'

               Hautboys play. The dumb show enters.


    Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing
    him and he her. She kneels,
 and makes show of protestation
    unto him. He takes her up, and declines his head upon her
    
neck. He lays him down upon a bank of flowers. She, seeing
    him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes i
n a fellow, takes off his
    crown, kisses it, pours poison in the sleeper's ears, and
    leaves
 him. The Queen returns, finds the King dead, and makes
    passionate action. The Poisoner with so
me three or four
Mutes,
    comes in again, seem to condole with her. The dead body is
    carrie
d away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with gifts; she
    seems harsh and unwilling awhile, but in t
he end accepts
    his love.
                                                         Exeunt.

 
 Oph. What means this, my lord?
  Ham. Marry, this is miching malhecho; it means mischief.
  Oph. 
Belike this show imports the argument of the play.

                      Enter Prologue.

  Ham
. We shall know by this fellow. The players cannot keep
counsel;
    they'll tell all.
  Oph. Wil
l he tell us what this show meant?
  Ham. Ay, or any show that you'll show him. Be not you asham'd

to
    show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means.
  Oph. You are naught, you are naught! I'
ll mark the play.

    Pro. For us, and for our tragedy,
      Here stooping to your clemency,
 
     We beg your hearing patiently.                     [Exit.]

  Ham. Is this a prologue, or the
 posy of a ring?
  Oph. 'Tis brief, my lord.
  Ham. As woman's love.

              Enter [two P
layers as] King and Queen.

    King. Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round
      Neptu
ne's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
      And thirty dozen moons with borrowed sheen
      Ab
out the world have times twelve thirties been,
      Since love our hearts, and Hymen did our hands
,
      Unite comutual in most sacred bands.
    Queen. So many journeys may the sun and moon
   
   Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
      But woe is me! you are so sick of late,
      
So far from cheer and from your former state.
      That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
 
     Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must;
      For women's fear and love holds quantity,
   
   In neither aught, or in extremity.
      Now what my love is, proof hath made you know;
      A
nd as my love is siz'd, my fear is so.
      Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
  
    Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.
    King. Faith, I must leave thee, love
, and shortly too;
      My operant powers their functions leave to do.
      And thou shalt live 
in this fair world behind,
      Honour'd, belov'd, and haply one as kind
      For husband shalt 
thou-
    Queen. O, confound the rest!
      Such love must needs be treason in my breast.
      
When second husband let me be accurst!
      None wed the second but who killed the first.

  Ham
. [aside] Wormwood, wormwood!

    Queen. The instances that second marriage move
      Are base 
respects of thrift, but none of love.
      A second time I kill my husband dead
      When second
 husband kisses me in bed.
    King. I do believe you think what now you speak;
      But what we 
do determine oft we break.
      Purpose is but the slave to memory,
      Of violent birth, but p
oor validity;
      Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree,
      But fall unshaken when
 they mellow be.
      Most necessary 'tis that we forget
      To pay ourselves what to ourselves
 is debt.
      What to ourselves in passion we propose,
      The passion ending, doth the purpos
e lose.
      The violence of either grief or joy
      Their own enactures with themselves destro
y.
      Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
      Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender 
accident.
      This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
      That even our loves should w
ith our fortunes change;
      For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
      Whether love lead f
ortune, or else fortune love.
      The great man down, you mark his favourite flies,
      The po
or advanc'd makes friends of enemies;
      And hitherto doth love on fortune tend,
      For who 
not needs shall never lack a friend,
      And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
      Directl
y seasons him his enemy.
      But, orderly to end where I begun,
      Our wills and fates do so 
contrary run
      That our devices still are overthrown;
      Our thoughts are ours, their ends 
none of our own.
      So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
      But die thy thoughts when t
hy first lord is dead.
    Queen. Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light,
      Sport and rep
ose lock from me day and night,
      To desperation turn my trust and hope,
      An anchor's che
er in prison be my scope,
      Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
      Meet what I would 
have well, and it destroy,
      Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
      If, once a wi
dow, ever I be wife!

  Ham. If she should break it now!

    King. 'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, le
ave me here awhile.
      My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile
      The tedious day wit
h sleep.
    Queen. Sleep rock thy brain,
                                                    [He]
 sleeps.
      And never come mischance between us twain!
Exit.

  Ham. Madam, how like you this
 play?
  Queen. The lady doth protest too much, methinks.
  Ham. O, but she'll keep her word.
  K
ing. Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in't?
  Ham. No, no! They do but jest, poison
 in jest; no offence i'
th'
    world.
  King. What do you call the play?
  Ham. 'The Mousetrap.
' Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the
    image of a murther done in Vienna. Gonzago is the du
ke's
name;
    his wife, Baptista. You shall see anon. 'Tis a knavish piece
of
    work; but wha
t o' that? Your Majesty, and we that have free
    souls, it touches us not. Let the gall'd jade wi
nch; our
withers
    are unwrung.

                         Enter Lucianus.

    This is one L
ucianus, nephew to the King.
  Oph. You are as good as a chorus, my lord.
  Ham. I could interpret
 between you and your love, if I could
see
    the puppets dallying.
  Oph. You are keen, my lord
, you are keen.
  Ham. It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
  Oph. Still better, and 
worse.
  Ham. So you must take your husbands.- Begin, murtherer. Pox,
leave
    thy damnable face
s, and begin! Come, the croaking raven doth
    bellow for revenge.

    Luc. Thoughts black, han
ds apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
      Confederate season, else no creature seeing;
      Tho
u mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,
      With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infecte
d,
      Thy natural magic and dire property
      On wholesome life usurp immediately.
         
                          Pours the poison in his ears.

  Ham. He poisons him i' th' garden for's
 estate. His name's
Gonzago.
    The story is extant, and written in very choice Italian. You
   
 shall see anon how the murtherer gets the love of Gonzago's
wife.
  Oph. The King rises.
  Ham. 
What, frighted with false fire?
  Queen. How fares my lord?
  Pol. Give o'er the play.
  King. Gi
ve me some light! Away!
  All. Lights, lights, lights!
                              Exeunt all bu
t Hamlet and Horatio.
  Ham.   Why, let the strucken deer go weep,
          The hart ungalled pla
y;
         For some must watch, while some must sleep:
          Thus runs the world away.
    W
ould not this, sir, and a forest of feathers- if the rest of
my
    fortunes turn Turk with me-wit
h two Provincial roses on my
raz'd
    shoes, get me a fellowship in a cry of players, sir?
  Hor
. Half a share.
  Ham.   A whole one I!
         For thou dost know, O Damon dear,
           Thi
s realm dismantled was
         Of Jove himself; and now reigns here
           A very, very- pajo
ck.
  Hor. You might have rhym'd.
  Ham. O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand

    pound! Didst perceive?
  Hor. Very well, my lord.
  Ham. Upon the talk of the poisoning?
  
Hor. I did very well note him.
  Ham.   Aha! Come, some music! Come, the recorders!
         For i
f the King like not the comedy,
         Why then, belike he likes it not, perdy.
    Come, some m
usic!

                Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Guil. Good my lord, vouchsafe me a
 word with you.
  Ham. Sir, a whole history.
  Guil. The King, sir-
  Ham. Ay, sir, what of him?

  Guil. Is in his retirement, marvellous distemper'd.
  Ham. With drink, sir?
  Guil. No, my lord
; rather with choler.
  Ham. Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this
to
    th
e doctor; for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps
    plunge him into far more choler.
  
Guil. Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame, and
start
    not so wildly from my affair
.
  Ham. I am tame, sir; pronounce.
  Guil. The Queen, your mother, in most great affliction of
s
pirit
    hath sent me to you.
  Ham. You are welcome.
  Guil. Nay, good my lord, this courtesy i
s not of the right
breed.
    If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, I will
do
  
  your mother's commandment; if not, your pardon and my return
    shall be the end of my business.

  Ham. Sir, I cannot.
  Guil. What, my lord?
  Ham. Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseas
'd. But, sir,
such
    answer as I can make, you shall command; or rather, as you
say,
    my mo
ther. Therefore no more, but to the matter! My mother,
you
    say-
  Ros. Then thus she says: yo
ur behaviour hath struck her into
    amazement and admiration.
  Ham. O wonderful son, that can s
o stonish a mother! But is
there no
    sequel at the heels of this mother's admiration? Impart.

  Ros. She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to
bed.
  Ham. We shall obey, were s
he ten times our mother. Have you any
    further trade with us?
  Ros. My lord, you once did love
 me.
  Ham. And do still, by these pickers and stealers!
  Ros. Good my lord, what is your cause o
f distemper? You do
surely
    bar the door upon your own liberty, if you deny your griefs
to
  
  your friend.
  Ham. Sir, I lack advancement.
  Ros. How can that be, when you have the voice of 
the King
himself
    for your succession in Denmark?
  Ham. Ay, sir, but 'while the grass grows'-
 the proverb is
something
    musty.

                     Enter the Players with recorders.


    O, the recorders! Let me see one. To withdraw with you- why
do
    you go about to recover the
 wind of me, as if you would drive
me
    into a toil?
  Guil. O my lord, if my duty be too bold,
 my love is too
unmannerly.
  Ham. I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this
pipe?

  Guil. My lord, I cannot.
  Ham. I pray you.
  Guil. Believe me, I cannot.
  Ham. I do beseech y
ou.
  Guil. I know, no touch of it, my lord.
  Ham. It is as easy as lying. Govern these ventages 
with your
    fingers and thumbs, give it breath with your mouth, and it
will
    discourse most 
eloquent music. Look you, these are the stops.
  Guil. But these cannot I command to any utt'rance 
of harmony. I
    have not the skill.
  Ham. Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of m
e!
You
    would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you
would
    pluck out the hear
t of my mystery; you would sound me from my
    lowest note to the top of my compass; and there is 
much
music,
    excellent voice, in this little organ, yet cannot you make it
    speak. 'Sblood,
 do you think I am easier to be play'd on than
a
    pipe? Call me what instrument you will, thoug
h you can fret
me,
    you cannot play upon me.

                        Enter Polonius.

    
God bless you, sir!
  Pol. My lord, the Queen would speak with you, and presently.
  Ham. Do you s
ee yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
  Pol. By th' mass, and 'tis like a camel indeed
.
  Ham. Methinks it is like a weasel.
  Pol. It is back'd like a weasel.
  Ham. Or like a whale.

  Pol. Very like a whale.
  Ham. Then will I come to my mother by-and-by.- They fool me to
the

    top of my bent.- I will come by-and-by.
  Pol. I will say so.                                  
    Exit.
  Ham. 'By-and-by' is easily said.- Leave me, friends.
                                 
       [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]

    'Tis now the very witching time of night,
    When churchyar
ds yawn, and hell itself breathes out
    Contagion to this world. Now could I drink hot blood
   
 And do such bitter business as the day
    Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother!
    O 
heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever
    The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom.
    Let me be
 cruel, not unnatural;
    I will speak daggers to her, but use none.
    My tongue and soul in th
is be hypocrites-
    How in my words somever she be shent,
    To give them seals never, my soul,
 consent!             Exit.




Scene III.
A room in the Castle.

Enter King, Rosencrantz, a
nd Guildenstern.

  King. I like him not, nor stands it safe with us
    To let his madness range
. Therefore prepare you;
    I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
    And he to England shal
l along with you.
    The terms of our estate may not endure
    Hazard so near us as doth hourly 
grow
    Out of his lunacies.
  Guil. We will ourselves provide.
    Most holy and religious fear
 it is
    To keep those many many bodies safe
    That live and feed upon your Majesty.
  Ros. T
he single and peculiar life is bound
    With all the strength and armour of the mind
    To keep 
itself from noyance; but much more
    That spirit upon whose weal depends and rests
    The lives
 of many. The cesse of majesty
    Dies not alone, but like a gulf doth draw
    What's near it wi
th it. It is a massy wheel,
    Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,
    To whose huge spokes
 ten thousand lesser things
    Are mortis'd and adjoin'd; which when it falls,
    Each small ann
exment, petty consequence,
    Attends the boist'rous ruin. Never alone
    Did the king sigh, but
 with a general groan.
  King. Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;
    For we will fetters
 put upon this fear,
    Which now goes too free-footed.
  Both. We will haste us.
              
                                 Exeunt Gentlemen.

                   Enter Polonius.

  Pol. M
y lord, he's going to his mother's closet.
    Behind the arras I'll convey myself
    To hear the
 process. I'll warrant she'll tax him home;
    And, as you said, and wisely was it said,
    'Tis
 meet that some more audience than a mother,
    Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear

    The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege.
    I'll call upon you ere you go to bed
    
And tell you what I know.
  King. Thanks, dear my lord.
                                          
      Exit [Polonius].
    O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven;
    It hath the primal elde
st curse upon't,
    A brother's murther! Pray can I not,
    Though inclination be as sharp as wi
ll.
    My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent,
    And, like a man to double business bound,

    I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
    And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
  
  Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,
    Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens

    To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
    But to confront the visage of offence?
   
 And what's in prayer but this twofold force,
    To be forestalled ere we come to fall,
    Or pa
rdon'd being down? Then I'll look up;
    My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer
    Can se
rve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murther'?
    That cannot be; since I am still possess'd
    Of t
hose effects for which I did the murther-
    My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.
    May o
ne be pardon'd and retain th' offence?
    In the corrupted currents of this world
    Offence's g
ilded hand may shove by justice,
    And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
    Buys out the la
w; but 'tis not so above.
    There is no shuffling; there the action lies
    In his true nature,
 and we ourselves compell'd,
    Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
    To give in evid
ence. What then? What rests?
    Try what repentance can. What can it not?
    Yet what can it whe
n one cannot repent?
    O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
    O limed soul, that, struggl
ing to be free,
    Art more engag'd! Help, angels! Make assay.
    Bow, stubborn knees; and heart
 with strings of steel,
    Be soft as sinews of the new-born babe!
    All may be well.          
                        He kneels.

                         Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Now might I d
o it pat, now he is praying;
    And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven,
    And so am I reve
ng'd. That would be scann'd.
    A villain kills my father; and for that,
    I, his sole son, do 
this same villain send
    To heaven.
    Why, this is hire and salary, not revenge!
    He took 
my father grossly, full of bread,
    With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
    And ho
w his audit stands, who knows save heaven?
    But in our circumstance and course of thought,
    
'Tis heavy with him; and am I then reveng'd,
    To take him in the purging of his soul,
    When 
he is fit and seasoned for his passage?
    No.
    Up, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent.

    When he is drunk asleep; or in his rage;
    Or in th' incestuous pleasure of his bed;
    At 
gaming, swearing, or about some act
    That has no relish of salvation in't-
    Then trip him, t
hat his heels may kick at heaven,
    And that his soul may be as damn'd and black
    As hell, wh
ereto it goes. My mother stays.
    This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.              Exit.
 
 King. [rises] My words fly up, my thoughts remain below.
    Words without thoughts never to heave
n go.             Exit.




Scene IV.
The Queen's closet.

Enter Queen and Polonius.

  Po
l. He will come straight. Look you lay home to him.
    Tell him his pranks have been too broad to 
bear with,
    And that your Grace hath screen'd and stood between
    Much heat and him. I'll sil
ence me even here.
    Pray you be round with him.
  Ham. (within) Mother, mother, mother!
  Quee
n. I'll warrant you; fear me not. Withdraw; I hear him
coming.
                              [Polo
nius hides behind the arras.]

                          Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Now, mother, what
's the matter?
  Queen. Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
  Ham. Mother, you have my fat
her much offended.
  Queen. Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
  Ham. Go, go, you questio
n with a wicked tongue.
  Queen. Why, how now, Hamlet?
  Ham. What's the matter now?
  Queen. Hav
e you forgot me?
  Ham. No, by the rood, not so!
    You are the Queen, your husband's brother's w
ife,
    And (would it were not so!) you are my mother.
  Queen. Nay, then I'll set those to you t
hat can speak.
  Ham. Come, come, and sit you down. You shall not budge;
    You go not till I set
 you up a glass
    Where you may see the inmost part of you.
  Queen. What wilt thou do? Thou wil
t not murther me?
    Help, help, ho!
  Pol. [behind] What, ho! help, help, help!
  Ham. [draws] 
How now? a rat? Dead for a ducat, dead!
            [Makes a pass through the arras and] kills Polo
nius.
  Pol. [behind] O, I am slain!
  Queen. O me, what hast thou done?
  Ham. Nay, I know not. 
Is it the King?
  Queen. O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
  Ham. A bloody deed- almost as b
ad, good mother,
    As kill a king, and marry with his brother.
  Queen. As kill a king?
  Ham. 
Ay, lady, it was my word.
                         [Lifts up the arras and sees Polonius.]
    Tho
u wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
    I took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune.
    
Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.
    Leave wringing of your hands. Peace! sit you down

    And let me wring your heart; for so I shall
    If it be made of penetrable stuff;
    If damn
ed custom have not braz'd it so
    That it is proof and bulwark against sense.
  Queen. What have
 I done that thou dar'st wag thy tongue
    In noise so rude against me?
  Ham. Such an act
    T
hat blurs the grace and blush of modesty;
    Calls virtue hypocrite; takes off the rose
    From 
the fair forehead of an innocent love,
    And sets a blister there; makes marriage vows
    As fa
lse as dicers' oaths. O, such a deed
    As from the body of contraction plucks
    The very soul,
 and sweet religion makes
    A rhapsody of words! Heaven's face doth glow;
    Yea, this solidity
 and compound mass,
    With tristful visage, as against the doom,
    Is thought-sick at the act.

  Queen. Ah me, what act,
    That roars so loud and thunders in the index?
  Ham. Look here upo
n th's picture, and on this,
    The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
    See what a grace
 was seated on this brow;
    Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
    An eye like Mars, t
o threaten and command;
    A station like the herald Mercury
    New lighted on a heaven-kissing 
hill:
    A combination and a form indeed
    Where every god did seem to set his seal
    To giv
e the world assurance of a man.
    This was your husband. Look you now what follows.
    Here is 
your husband, like a mildew'd ear
    Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
    Could you
 on this fair mountain leave to feed,
    And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes
    You canno
t call it love; for at your age
    The heyday in the blood is tame, it's humble,
    And waits up
on the judgment; and what judgment
    Would step from this to this? Sense sure you have,
    Else
 could you not have motion; but sure that sense
    Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,
    N
or sense to ecstacy was ne'er so thrall'd
    But it reserv'd some quantity of choice
    To serve
 in such a difference. What devil was't
    That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
    Eyes 
without feeling, feeling without sight,
    Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
    Or 
but a sickly part of one true sense
    Could not so mope.
    O shame! where is thy blush? Rebell
ious hell,
    If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
    To flaming youth let virtue be as wax

    And melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame
    When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,

    Since frost itself as actively doth burn,
    And reason panders will.
  Queen. O Hamlet, spe
ak no more!
    Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul,
    And there I see such black and grain
ed spots
    As will not leave their tinct.
  Ham. Nay, but to live
    In the rank sweat of an e
nseamed bed,
    Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love
    Over the nasty sty!
  Queen. 
O, speak to me no more!
    These words like daggers enter in mine ears.
    No more, sweet Hamlet
!
  Ham. A murtherer and a villain!
    A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
    Of your 
precedent lord; a vice of kings;
    A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
    That from a shelf 
the precious diadem stole
    And put it in his pocket!
  Queen. No more!

                Enter
 the Ghost in his nightgown.

  Ham. A king of shreds and patches!-
    Save me and hover o'er me
 with your wings,
    You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?
  Queen. Alas, he's ma
d!
  Ham. Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
    That, laps'd in time and passion, lets go b
y
    Th' important acting of your dread command?
    O, say!
  Ghost. Do not forget. This visita
tion
    Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
    But look, amazement on thy mother sits.
 
   O, step between her and her fighting soul
    Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works.
    Sp
eak to her, Hamlet.
  Ham. How is it with you, lady?
  Queen. Alas, how is't with you,
    That y
ou do bend your eye on vacancy,
    And with th' encorporal air do hold discourse?
    Forth at yo
ur eyes your spirits wildly peep;
    And, as the sleeping soldiers in th' alarm,
    Your bedded 
hairs, like life in excrements,
    Start up and stand an end. O gentle son,
    Upon the heat and
 flame of thy distemper
    Sprinkle cool patience! Whereon do you look?
  Ham. On him, on him! Lo
ok you how pale he glares!
    His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
    Would make t
hem capable.- Do not look upon me,
    Lest with this piteous action you convert
    My stern effe
cts. Then what I have to do
    Will want true colour- tears perchance for blood.
  Queen. To whom
 do you speak this?
  Ham. Do you see nothing there?
  Queen. Nothing at all; yet all that is I se
e.
  Ham. Nor did you nothing hear?
  Queen. No, nothing but ourselves.
  Ham. Why, look you ther
e! Look how it steals away!
    My father, in his habit as he liv'd!
    Look where he goes even n
ow out at the portal!
                                                     Exit Ghost.
  Queen. Th
is is the very coinage of your brain.
    This bodiless creation ecstasy
    Is very cunning in.

  Ham. Ecstasy?
    My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time
    And makes as healthful music.
 It is not madness
    That I have utt'red. Bring me to the test,
    And I the matter will reword
; which madness
    Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
    Lay not that flattering unct
ion to your soul
    That not your trespass but my madness speaks.
    It will but skin and film t
he ulcerous place,
    Whiles rank corruption, mining all within,
    Infects unseen. Confess your
self to heaven;
    Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
    And do not spread the compost o
n the weeds
    To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;
    For in the fatness of these pu
rsy times
    Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg-
    Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him goo
d.
  Queen. O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
  Ham. O, throw away the worser part of i
t,
    And live the purer with the other half,
    Good night- but go not to my uncle's bed.
    
Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
    That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat
    Of habit
s evil, is angel yet in this,
    That to the use of actions fair and good
    He likewise gives a
 frock or livery,
    That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,
    And that shall lend a kind of ea
siness
    To the next abstinence; the next more easy;
    For use almost can change the stamp of 
nature,
    And either [master] the devil, or throw him out
    With wondrous potency. Once more, 
good night;
    And when you are desirous to be blest,
    I'll blessing beg of you.- For this sam
e lord,
    I do repent; but heaven hath pleas'd it so,
    To punish me with this, and this with 
me,
    That I must be their scourge and minister.
    I will bestow him, and will answer well
  
  The death I gave him. So again, good night.
    I must be cruel, only to be kind;
    Thus bad b
egins, and worse remains behind.
    One word more, good lady.
  Queen. What shall I do?
  Ham. N
ot this, by no means, that I bid you do:
    Let the bloat King tempt you again to bed;
    Pinch 
wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
    And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
    Or pad
dling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,
    Make you to ravel all this matter out,
    That I 
essentially am not in madness,
    But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;
    For who tha
t's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
    Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib
    Such dear conc
ernings hide? Who would do so?
    No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
    Unpeg the basket on th
e house's top,
    Let the birds fly, and like the famous ape,
    To try conclusions, in the bask
et creep
    And break your own neck down.
  Queen. Be thou assur'd, if words be made of breath,

    And breath of life, I have no life to breathe
    What thou hast said to me.
  Ham. I must to 
England; you know that?
  Queen. Alack,
    I had forgot! 'Tis so concluded on.
  Ham. There's le
tters seal'd; and my two schoolfellows,
    Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,
    They be
ar the mandate; they must sweep my way
    And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
    For 'tis th
e sport to have the enginer
    Hoist with his own petar; and 't shall go hard
    But I will delv
e one yard below their mines
    And blow them at the moon. O, 'tis most sweet
    When in one lin
e two crafts directly meet.
    This man shall set me packing.
    I'll lug the guts into the neig
hbour room.-
    Mother, good night.- Indeed, this counsellor
    Is now most still, most secret, 
and most grave,
    Who was in life a foolish peating knave.
    Come, sir, to draw toward an end 
with you.
    Good night, mother.
                  [Exit the Queen. Then] Exit Hamlet, tugging in

                                                       Polonius.

ACT IV. Scen
e I.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King and Queen, with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.


  King. There's matter in these sighs. These profound heaves
    You must translate; 'tis fit we u
nderstand them.
    Where is your son?
  Queen. Bestow this place on us a little while.
         
                 [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
    Ah, mine own lord, what have I seen to-
night!
  King. What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
  Queen. Mad as the sea and wind when both contend

    Which is the mightier. In his lawless fit
    Behind the arras hearing something stir,
    W
hips out his rapier, cries 'A rat, a rat!'
    And in this brainish apprehension kills
    The uns
een good old man.
  King. O heavy deed!
    It had been so with us, had we been there.
    His li
berty is full of threats to all-
    To you yourself, to us, to every one.
    Alas, how shall thi
s bloody deed be answer'd?
    It will be laid to us, whose providence
    Should have kept short,
 restrain'd, and out of haunt
    This mad young man. But so much was our love
    We would not un
derstand what was most fit,
    But, like the owner of a foul disease,
    To keep it from divulgi
ng, let it feed
    Even on the pith of life. Where is he gone?
  Queen. To draw apart the body he
 hath kill'd;
    O'er whom his very madness, like some ore
    Among a mineral of metals base,
 
   Shows itself pure. He weeps for what is done.
  King. O Gertrude, come away!
    The sun no soo
ner shall the mountains touch
    But we will ship him hence; and this vile deed
    We must with 
all our majesty and skill
    Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!

             Enter 
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

    Friends both, go join you with some further aid.
    Hamlet in
 madness hath Polonius slain,
    And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him.
    Go seek hi
m out; speak fair, and bring the body
    Into the chapel. I pray you haste in this.
             
             Exeunt [Rosencrantz and Guildenstern].
    Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest fr
iends
    And let them know both what we mean to do
    And what's untimely done. [So haply slande
r-]
    Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter,
    As level as the cannon to his blank,
    Tra
nsports his poisoned shot- may miss our name
    And hit the woundless air.- O, come away!
    My 
soul is full of discord and dismay.
                                                         Exeunt
.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A passage in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Safely stow'd.

  Gentlemen. (within) Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!
  Ham. But soft! What noise? Who calls on Hamlet? O, her
e they
come.

               Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Ros. What have you done, my
 lord, with the dead body?
  Ham. Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
  Ros. Tell us where 
'tis, that we may take it thence
    And bear it to the chapel.
  Ham. Do not believe it.
  Ros. 
Believe what?
  Ham. That I can keep your counsel, and not mine own. Besides,
to be
    demanded 
of a sponge, what replication should be made by the
son
    of a king?
  Ros. Take you me for a s
ponge, my lord?
  Ham. Ay, sir; that soaks up the King's countenance, his
rewards,
    his author
ities. But such officers do the King best service
in
    the end. He keeps them, like an ape, in t
he corner of his
jaw;
    first mouth'd, to be last swallowed. When he needs what you
have
    g
lean'd, it is but squeezing you and, sponge, you shall be
dry
    again.
  Ros. I understand you 
not, my lord.
  Ham. I am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.
  Ros. My lord, yo
u must tell us where the body is and go with us
to
    the King.
  Ham. The body is with the King
, but the King is not with the
body.
    The King is a thing-
  Guil. A thing, my lord?
  Ham. O
f nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.
                                              
           Exeunt.




Scene III.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King.

  King. I 
have sent to seek him and to find the body.
    How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
    
Yet must not we put the strong law on him.
    He's lov'd of the distracted multitude,
    Who lik
e not in their judgment, but their eyes;
    And where 'tis so, th' offender's scourge is weigh'd,

    But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,
    This sudden sending him away must seem

    Deliberate pause. Diseases desperate grown
    By desperate appliance are reliev'd,
    Or n
ot at all.

                    Enter Rosencrantz.

    How now O What hath befall'n?
  Ros. Wh
ere the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
    We cannot get from him.
  King. But where is he?
  Ro
s. Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
  King. Bring him before us.
  Ros. Ho, Guild
enstern! Bring in my lord.

        Enter Hamlet and Guildenstern [with Attendants].

  King. No
w, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
  Ham. At supper.
  King. At supper? Where?
  Ham. Not where he eats
, but where he is eaten. A certain
    convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your worm is

your
    only emperor for diet. We fat all creatures else to fat us,
and
    we fat ourselves for
 maggots. Your fat king and your lean
beggar
    is but variable service- two dishes, but to one t
able. That's
the
    end.
  King. Alas, alas!
  Ham. A man may fish with the worm that hath eat 
of a king, and
eat
    of the fish that hath fed of that worm.
  King. What dost thou mean by thi
s?
  Ham. Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress
through
    the guts of a beggar.

  King. Where is Polonius?
  Ham. In heaven. Send thither to see. If your messenger find him
not

    there, seek him i' th' other place yourself. But indeed, if
you
    find him not within this 
month, you shall nose him as you go
up
    the stair, into the lobby.
  King. Go seek him there. 
[To Attendants.]
  Ham. He will stay till you come.
                                            [E
xeunt Attendants.]
  King. Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,-
    Which we do tender a
s we dearly grieve
    For that which thou hast done,- must send thee hence
    With fiery quickne
ss. Therefore prepare thyself.
    The bark is ready and the wind at help,
    Th' associates tend
, and everything is bent
    For England.
  Ham. For England?
  King. Ay, Hamlet.
  Ham. Good.

  King. So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
  Ham. I see a cherub that sees them. But come, for
 England!
    Farewell, dear mother.
  King. Thy loving father, Hamlet.
  Ham. My mother! Father 
and mother is man and wife; man and wife
is
    one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England!

Exit.
  King. Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard.
    Delay it not; I'll have him hen
ce to-night.
    Away! for everything is seal'd and done
    That else leans on th' affair. Pray y
ou make haste.
                            Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]
    And, England, 
if my love thou hold'st at aught,-
    As my great power thereof may give thee sense,
    Since ye
t thy cicatrice looks raw and red
    After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
    Pays homage to 
us,- thou mayst not coldly set
    Our sovereign process, which imports at full,
    By letters co
ngruing to that effect,
    The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;
    For like the hectic i
n my blood he rages,
    And thou must cure me. Till I know 'tis done,
    Howe'er my haps, my joy
s were ne'er begun.             Exit.

Scene IV.
Near Elsinore.

Enter Fortin
bras with his Army over the stage.

  For. Go, Captain, from me greet the Danish king.
    Tell h
im that by his license Fortinbras
    Craves the conveyance of a promis'd march
    Over his kingd
om. You know the rendezvous.
    If that his Majesty would aught with us,
    We shall express our
 duty in his eye;
    And let him know so.
  Capt. I will do't, my lord.
  For. Go softly on.
  
                                 Exeunt [all but the Captain].

       Enter Hamlet, Rosencrantz, 
[Guildenstern,] and others.

  Ham. Good sir, whose powers are these?
  Capt. They are of Norway,
 sir.
  Ham. How purpos'd, sir, I pray you?
  Capt. Against some part of Poland.
  Ham. Who comma
nds them, sir?
  Capt. The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.
  Ham. Goes it against the main of Po
land, sir,
    Or for some frontier?
  Capt. Truly to speak, and with no addition,
    We go to g
ain a little patch of ground
    That hath in it no profit but the name.
    To pay five ducats, f
ive, I would not farm it;
    Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
    A ranker rate, should it
 be sold in fee.
  Ham. Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
  Capt. Yes, it is already garr
ison'd.
  Ham. Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
    Will not debate the question of t
his straw.
    This is th' imposthume of much wealth and peace,
    That inward breaks, and shows 
no cause without
    Why the man dies.- I humbly thank you, sir.
  Capt. God b' wi' you, sir.     
                        [Exit.]
  Ros. Will't please you go, my lord?
  Ham. I'll be with you stra
ight. Go a little before.
                                        [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]
    How
 all occasions do inform against me
    And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
    If his chief 
good and market of his time
    Be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.
    Sure he that made 
us with such large discourse,
    Looking before and after, gave us not
    That capability and go
dlike reason
    To fust in us unus'd. Now, whether it be
    Bestial oblivion, or some craven scr
uple
    Of thinking too precisely on th' event,-
    A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one par
t wisdom
    And ever three parts coward,- I do not know
    Why yet I live to say 'This thing's t
o do,'
    Sith I have cause, and will, and strength, and means
    To do't. Examples gross as ear
th exhort me.
    Witness this army of such mass and charge,
    Led by a delicate and tender prin
ce,
    Whose spirit, with divine ambition puff'd,
    Makes mouths at the invisible event,
    E
xposing what is mortal and unsure
    To all that fortune, death, and danger dare,
    Even for an
 eggshell. Rightly to be great
    Is not to stir without great argument,
    But greatly to find 
quarrel in a straw
    When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,
    That have a father kill'd
, a mother stain'd,
    Excitements of my reason and my blood,
    And let all sleep, while to my 
shame I see
    The imminent death of twenty thousand men
    That for a fantasy and trick of fame

    Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot
    Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,

    Which is not tomb enough and continent
    To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,
    My
 thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!            Exit.

Scene V.
Elsinore. 
A room in the Castle.

Enter Horatio, Queen, and a Gentleman.

  Queen. I will not speak with he
r.
  Gent. She is importunate, indeed distract.
    Her mood will needs be pitied.
  Queen. What 
would she have?
  Gent. She speaks much of her father; says she hears
    There's tricks i' th' wo
rld, and hems, and beats her heart;
    Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,
    Th
at carry but half sense. Her speech is nothing,
    Yet the unshaped use of it doth move
    The h
earers to collection; they aim at it,
    And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;
    Wh
ich, as her winks and nods and gestures yield them,
    Indeed would make one think there might be 
thought,
    Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
  Hor. 'Twere good she were spoken with; for
 she may strew
    Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.
  Queen. Let her come in.
       
                                        [Exit Gentleman.]
    [Aside] To my sick soul (as sin's tru
e nature is)
    Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
    So full of artless jealousy is g
uilt
    It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.

                 Enter Ophelia distracted.


  Oph. Where is the beauteous Majesty of Denmark?
  Queen. How now, Ophelia?
  Oph. (sings)
     
    How should I your true-love know
           From another one?
         By his cockle bat and' 
staff
           And his sandal shoon.

  Queen. Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
  Oph
. Say you? Nay, pray You mark.

    (Sings) He is dead and gone, lady,
              He is dead a
nd gone;
            At his head a grass-green turf,
              At his heels a stone.

    O,
 ho!
  Queen. Nay, but Ophelia-
  Oph. Pray you mark.

    (Sings) White his shroud as the mount
ain snow-

                    Enter King.

  Queen. Alas, look here, my lord!
  Oph. (Sings)

           Larded all with sweet flowers;
         Which bewept to the grave did not go
          
 With true-love showers.

  King. How do you, pretty lady?
  Oph. Well, God dild you! They say th
e owl was a baker's
daughter.
    Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be. God
be 
at
    your table!
  King. Conceit upon her father.
  Oph. Pray let's have no words of this; but 
when they ask, you
what
    it means, say you this:

    (Sings) To-morrow is Saint Valentine's 
day,
              All in the morning bedtime,
            And I a maid at your window,
         
     To be your Valentine.

            Then up he rose and donn'd his clo'es
              And d
upp'd the chamber door,
            Let in the maid, that out a maid
              Never departed 
more.

  King. Pretty Ophelia!
  Oph. Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't!

    
[Sings] By Gis and by Saint Charity,
              Alack, and fie for shame!
            Young men
 will do't if they come to't
              By Cock, they are to blame.

            Quoth she, 'B
efore you tumbled me,
              You promis'd me to wed.'

    He answers:

            'So 
would I 'a' done, by yonder sun,
              An thou hadst not come to my bed.'

  King. How lo
ng hath she been thus?
  Oph. I hope all will be well. We must be patient; but I cannot
    choose
 but weep to think they would lay him i' th' cold
ground.
    My brother shall know of it; and so 
I thank you for your good
    counsel. Come, my coach! Good night, ladies. Good night,
sweet
    
ladies. Good night, good night.                         Exit
  King. Follow her close; give her goo
d watch, I pray you.
                                                 [Exit Horatio.]

    O, thi
s is the poison of deep grief; it springs
    All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
 
   When sorrows come, they come not single spies.
    But in battalions! First, her father slain;

    Next, your son gone, and he most violent author
    Of his own just remove; the people muddied,

    Thick and and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers
    For good Polonius' death, and we
 have done but greenly
    In hugger-mugger to inter him; poor Ophelia
    Divided from herself an
d her fair judgment,
    Without the which we are pictures or mere beasts;
    Last, and as much c
ontaining as all these,
    Her brother is in secret come from France;
    And wants not buzzers t
o infect his ear
    Feeds on his wonder, keep, himself in clouds,
    With pestilent speeches of 
his father's death,
    Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
    Will nothing stick our person t
o arraign
    In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
    Like to a murd'ring piece, in many pla
ces
    Give me superfluous death.                  A noise within.
  Queen. Alack, what noise is 
this?
  King. Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.

                     Enter a Messe
nger.

    What is the matter?
  Mess. Save Yourself, my lord:
    The ocean, overpeering of his
 list,
    Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
    Than Young Laertes, in a riotous head,

    O'erbears Your offices. The rabble call him lord;
    And, as the world were now but to begin
,
    Antiquity forgot, custom not known,
    The ratifiers and props of every word,
    They cry
 'Choose we! Laertes shall be king!'
    Caps, hands, and tongues applaud it to the clouds,
    'L
aertes shall be king! Laertes king!'
                                                 A noise withi
n.
  Queen. How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!
    O, this is counter, you false Danish d
ogs!
  King. The doors are broke.

                    Enter Laertes with others.

  Laer. Wher
e is this king?- Sirs, staid you all without.
  All. No, let's come in!
  Laer. I pray you give me
 leave.
  All. We will, we will!
  Laer. I thank you. Keep the door.      [Exeunt his Followers.]

    O thou vile king,
    Give me my father!
  Queen. Calmly, good Laertes.
  Laer. That drop of
 blood that's calm proclaims me bastard;
    Cries cuckold to my father; brands the harlot
    Eve
n here between the chaste unsmirched brows
    Of my true mother.
  King. What is the cause, Laert
es,
    That thy rebellion looks so giantlike?
    Let him go, Gertrude. Do not fear our person.

    There's such divinity doth hedge a king
    That treason can but peep to what it would,
    Ac
ts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,
    Why thou art thus incens'd. Let him go, Gertrude.
   
 Speak, man.
  Laer. Where is my father?
  King. Dead.
  Queen. But not by him!
  King. Let him 
demand his fill.
  Laer. How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
    To hell, allegiance! vows
, to the blackest devil
    Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
    I dare damnation. To
 this point I stand,
    That both the world, I give to negligence,
    Let come what comes; only 
I'll be reveng'd
    Most throughly for my father.
  King. Who shall stay you?
  Laer. My will, n
ot all the world!
    And for my means, I'll husband them so well
    They shall go far with littl
e.
  King. Good Laertes,
    If you desire to know the certainty
    Of your dear father's death,
 is't writ in your revenge
    That sweepstake you will draw both friend and foe,
    Winner and l
oser?
  Laer. None but his enemies.
  King. Will you know them then?
  Laer. To his good friends 
thus wide I'll ope my arms
    And, like the kind life-rend'ring pelican,
    Repast them with my 
blood.
  King. Why, now You speak
    Like a good child and a true gentleman.
    That I am guilt
less of your father's death,
    And am most sensibly in grief for it,
    It shall as level to yo
ur judgment pierce
    As day does to your eye.
                              A noise within: 'Let
 her come in.'
  Laer. How now? What noise is that?

                      Enter Ophelia.

    
O heat, dry up my brains! Tears seven times salt
    Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!
  
  By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight
    Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!

    Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
    O heavens! is't possible a young maid's wits
    Sh
ould be as mortal as an old man's life?
    Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,
    It se
nds some precious instance of itself
    After the thing it loves.

  Oph. (sings)
         They
 bore him barefac'd on the bier
           (Hey non nony, nony, hey nony)
         And in his grav
e rain'd many a tear.

    Fare you well, my dove!
  Laer. Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuad
e revenge,
    It could not move thus.
  Oph. You must sing 'A-down a-down, and you call him a-dow
n-a.'
O,
    how the wheel becomes it! It is the false steward, that stole
his
    master's daug
hter.
  Laer. This nothing's more than matter.
  Oph. There's rosemary, that's for remembrance. Pr
ay you, love,
    remember. And there is pansies, that's for thoughts.
  Laer. A document in madne
ss! Thoughts and remembrance fitted.
  Oph. There's fennel for you, and columbines. There's rue for

you,
    and here's some for me. We may call it herb of grace o'
Sundays.
    O, you must wear 
your rue with a difference! There's a daisy.
I
    would give you some violets, but they wither'd 
all when my
father
    died. They say he made a good end.

    [Sings] For bonny sweet Robin is 
all my joy.

  Laer. Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,
    She turns to favour and to
 prettiness.
  Oph. (sings)
         And will he not come again?
         And will he not come ag
ain?
           No, no, he is dead;
           Go to thy deathbed;
         He never will come ag
ain.

         His beard was as white as snow,
         All flaxen was his poll.
           He i
s gone, he is gone,
           And we cast away moan.
         God 'a'mercy on his soul!

    An
d of all Christian souls, I pray God. God b' wi' you.
Exit.
  Laer. Do you see this, O God?
  Kin
g. Laertes, I must commune with your grief,
    Or you deny me right. Go but apart,
    Make choic
e of whom your wisest friends you will,
    And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me.
    I
f by direct or by collateral hand
    They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,
    Our crow
n, our life, and all that we call ours,
    To you in satisfaction; but if not,
    Be you content
 to lend your patience to us,
    And we shall jointly labour with your soul
    To give it due co
ntent.
  Laer. Let this be so.
    His means of death, his obscure funeral-
    No trophy, sword,
 nor hatchment o'er his bones,
    No noble rite nor formal ostentation,-
    Cry to be heard, as 
'twere from heaven to earth,
    That I must call't in question.
  King. So you shall;
    And wh
ere th' offence is let the great axe fall.
    I pray you go with me.
                            
                              Exeunt

Scene VI.
Elsinore. Another room in the C
astle.

Enter Horatio with an Attendant.

  Hor. What are they that would speak with me?
  Serv
ant. Seafaring men, sir. They say they have letters for
you.
  Hor. Let them come in.
           
                                    [Exit Attendant.]
    I do not know from what part of the world

    I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.

                          Enter Sailors.

 
 Sailor. God bless you, sir.
  Hor. Let him bless thee too.
  Sailor. 'A shall, sir, an't please h
im. There's a letter for
you,
    sir,- it comes from th' ambassador that was bound for
England- 
if
    your name be Horatio, as I am let to know it is.
  Hor. (reads the letter) 'Horatio, when t
hou shalt have
overlook'd
    this, give these fellows some means to the King. They have
    lett
ers for him. Ere we were two days old at sea, a pirate of

    very warlike appointment gave us ch
ase. Finding ourselves too
    slow of sail, we put on a compelled valour, and in the
grapple I
 
   boarded them. On the instant they got clear of our ship; so I
    alone became their prisoner. T
hey have dealt with me like
thieves
    of mercy; but they knew what they did: I am to do a good t
urn
for
    them. Let the King have the letters I have sent, and repair
thou
    to me with as m
uch speed as thou wouldst fly death. I have
words
    to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb; y
et are they much
too
    light for the bore of the matter. These good fellows will
bring
    the
e where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their
course
    for England. Of them I have much 
to tell thee. Farewell.
                            'He that thou knowest thine, HAMLET.'

    Co
me, I will give you way for these your letters,
    And do't the speedier that you may direct me
 
   To him from whom you brought them.                   Exeunt.

Scene VII.
Els
inore. Another room in the Castle.

Enter King and Laertes.

  King. Now must your conscience my
 acquittance seal,
    And You must put me in your heart for friend,
    Sith you have heard, and 
with a knowing ear,
    That he which hath your noble father slain
    Pursued my life.
  Laer. I
t well appears. But tell me
    Why you proceeded not against these feats
    So crimeful and so c
apital in nature,
    As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
    You mainly were stirr'd up.

  King. O, for two special reasons,
    Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,
    But y
et to me they are strong. The Queen his mother
    Lives almost by his looks; and for myself,-
   
 My virtue or my plague, be it either which,-
    She's so conjunctive to my life and soul
    Tha
t, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
    I could not but by her. The other motive
    Why t
o a public count I might not go
    Is the great love the general gender bear him,
    Who, dippin
g all his faults in their affection,
    Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
    Co
nvert his gives to graces; so that my arrows,
    Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,
    Wo
uld have reverted to my bow again,
    And not where I had aim'd them.
  Laer. And so have I a nob
le father lost;
    A sister driven into desp'rate terms,
    Whose worth, if praises may go back 
again,
    Stood challenger on mount of all the age
    For her perfections. But my revenge will c
ome.
  King. Break not your sleeps for that. You must not think
    That we are made of stuff so f
lat and dull
    That we can let our beard be shook with danger,
    And think it pastime. You sho
rtly shall hear more.
    I lov'd your father, and we love ourself,
    And that, I hope, will tea
ch you to imagine-

                 Enter a Messenger with letters.

    How now? What news?
 
 Mess. Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:
    This to your Majesty; this to the Queen.
  King. From Ha
mlet? Who brought them?
  Mess. Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not.
    They were given me
 by Claudio; he receiv'd them
    Of him that brought them.
  King. Laertes, you shall hear them.

    Leave us.
                                                 Exit Messenger.
    [Reads]'High a
nd Mighty,-You shall know I am set naked on
your
    kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see y
our kingly eyes;
    when I shall (first asking your pardon thereunto) recount the
    occasion of
 my sudden and more strange return.
                                                     'HAMLET.'

    What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?
    Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?

  Laer. Know you the hand?
  King. 'Tis Hamlet's character. 'Naked!'
    And in a postscript her
e, he says 'alone.'
    Can you advise me?
  Laer. I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come!
  
  It warms the very sickness in my heart
    That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,
    'Thu
s didest thou.'
  King. If it be so, Laertes
    (As how should it be so? how otherwise?),
    Wi
ll you be rul'd by me?
  Laer. Ay my lord,
    So you will not o'errule me to a peace.
  King. To
 thine own peace. If he be now return'd
    As checking at his voyage, and that he means
    No mo
re to undertake it, I will work him
    To exploit now ripe in my device,
    Under the which he s
hall not choose but fall;
    And for his death no wind shall breathe
    But even his mother shal
l uncharge the practice
    And call it accident.
  Laer. My lord, I will be rul'd;
    The rathe
r, if you could devise it so
    That I might be the organ.
  King. It falls right.
    You have 
been talk'd of since your travel much,
    And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality
    Wherein
 they say you shine, Your sum of parts
    Did not together pluck such envy from him
    As did th
at one; and that, in my regard,
    Of the unworthiest siege.
  Laer. What part is that, my lord?

  King. A very riband in the cap of youth-
    Yet needfull too; for youth no less becomes
    Th
e light and careless livery that it wears
    Than settled age his sables and his weeds,
    Impor
ting health and graveness. Two months since
    Here was a gentleman of Normandy.
    I have seen 
myself, and serv'd against, the French,
    And they can well on horseback; but this gallant
    H
ad witchcraft in't. He grew unto his seat,
    And to such wondrous doing brought his horse
    As
 had he been incorps'd and demi-natur'd
    With the brave beast. So far he topp'd my thought
    
That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
    Come short of what he did.
  Laer. A Norman was't?
 
 King. A Norman.
  Laer. Upon my life, Lamound.
  King. The very same.
  Laer. I know him well. H
e is the broach indeed
    And gem of all the nation.
  King. He made confession of you;
    And 
gave you such a masterly report
    For art and exercise in your defence,
    And for your rapier 
most especially,
    That he cried out 'twould be a sight indeed
    If one could match you. The s
crimers of their nation
    He swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
    If you oppos'd them. 
Sir, this report of his
    Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
    That he could nothing do but w
ish and beg
    Your sudden coming o'er to play with you.
    Now, out of this-
  Laer. What out 
of this, my lord?
  King. Laertes, was your father dear to you?
    Or are you like the painting o
f a sorrow,
    A face without a heart,'
  Laer. Why ask you this?
  King. Not that I think you d
id not love your father;
    But that I know love is begun by time,
    And that I see, in passage
s of proof,
    Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
    There lives within the very flame of 
love
    A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
    And nothing is at a like goodness still;

    For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
    Dies in his own too-much. That we would do,
    We sh
ould do when we would; for this 'would' changes,
    And hath abatements and delays as many
    As
 there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
    And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh
,
    That hurts by easing. But to the quick o' th' ulcer!
    Hamlet comes back. What would you u
ndertake
    To show yourself your father's son in deed
    More than in words?
  Laer. To cut hi
s throat i' th' church!
  King. No place indeed should murther sanctuarize;
    Revenge should hav
e no bounds. But, good Laertes,
    Will you do this? Keep close within your chamber.
    Hamlet r
eturn'd shall know you are come home.
    We'll put on those shall praise your excellence
    And 
set a double varnish on the fame
    The Frenchman gave you; bring you in fine together
    And wa
ger on your heads. He, being remiss,
    Most generous, and free from all contriving,
    Will not
 peruse the foils; so that with ease,
    Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
    A sword u
nbated, and, in a pass of practice,
    Requite him for your father.
  Laer. I will do't!
    And
 for that purpose I'll anoint my sword.
    I bought an unction of a mountebank,
    So mortal tha
t, but dip a knife in it,
    Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
    Collected from all si
mples that have virtue
    Under the moon, can save the thing from death
    This is but scratch'd
 withal. I'll touch my point
    With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
    It may be 
death.
  King. Let's further think of this,
    Weigh what convenience both of time and means
   
 May fit us to our shape. If this should fall,
    And that our drift look through our bad performa
nce.
    'Twere better not assay'd. Therefore this project
    Should have a back or second, that 
might hold
    If this did blast in proof. Soft! let me see.
    We'll make a solemn wager on your
 cunnings-
    I ha't!
    When in your motion you are hot and dry-
    As make your bouts more v
iolent to that end-
    And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepar'd him
    A chalice for the 
nonce; whereon but sipping,
    If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
    Our purpose may hol
d there.- But stay, what noise,

                           Enter Queen.

    How now, sweet que
en?
  Queen. One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
    So fast they follow. Your sister's drown'
d, Laertes.
  Laer. Drown'd! O, where?
  Queen. There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
    That 
shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream.
    There with fantastic garlands did she come
    Of 
crowflowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,
    That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
 
   But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them.
    There on the pendant boughs her coronet 
weeds
    Clamb'ring to hang, an envious sliver broke,
    When down her weedy trophies and hersel
f
    Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide
    And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore h
er up;
    Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes,
    As one incapable of her own distress
,
    Or like a creature native and indued
    Unto that element; but long it could not be
    Ti
ll that her garments, heavy with their drink,
    Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay
  
  To muddy death.
  Laer. Alas, then she is drown'd?
  Queen. Drown'd, drown'd.
  Laer. Too much 
of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
    And therefore I forbid my tears; but yet
    It is our trick
; nature her custom holds,
    Let shame say what it will. When these are gone,
    The woman will
 be out. Adieu, my lord.
    I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze
    But that this foll
y douts it.                          Exit.
  King. Let's follow, Gertrude.
    How much I had to d
o to calm his rage I
    Now fear I this will give it start again;
    Therefore let's follow.
  
                                                       Exeunt.

ACT V. Scene I.

Elsinore. A churchyard.

Enter two Clowns, [with spades and pickaxes].

  Clown. Is she to be b
uried in Christian burial when she
wilfully
    seeks her own salvation?
  Other. I tell thee she
 is; therefore make her grave straight.
    The crowner hath sate on her, and finds it Christian bu
rial.
  Clown. How can that be, unless she drown'd herself in her own
    defence?
  Other. Why, 
'tis found so.
  Clown. It must be se offendendo; it cannot be else. For here
lies
    the point:
 if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act; and
an
    act hath three branches-it is to act, t
o do, and to perform;
    argal, she drown'd herself wittingly.
  Other. Nay, but hear you, Goodma
n Delver!
  Clown. Give me leave. Here lies the water; good. Here stands
the
    man; good. If th
e man go to this water and drown himself, it
is,
    will he nill he, he goes- mark you that. But 
if the water
come to
    him and drown him, he drowns not himself. Argal, he that is
not
    gui
lty of his own death shortens not his own life.
  Other. But is this law?
  Clown. Ay, marry, is't
- crowner's quest law.
  Other. Will you ha' the truth an't? If this had not been a
    gentlewoma
n, she should have been buried out o' Christian
burial.
  Clown. Why, there thou say'st! And the m
ore pity that great
folk
    should have count'nance in this world to drown or hang
themselves
 
   more than their even-Christian. Come, my spade! There is no
    ancient gentlemen but gard'ners,
 ditchers, and grave-makers.
They
    hold up Adam's profession.
  Other. Was he a gentleman?
  
Clown. 'A was the first that ever bore arms.
  Other. Why, he had none.
  Clown. What, art a heath
en? How dost thou understand the
Scripture?
    The Scripture says Adam digg'd. Could he dig witho
ut arms?
I'll
    put another question to thee. If thou answerest me not to the
    purpose, conf
ess thyself-
  Other. Go to!
  Clown. What is he that builds stronger than either the mason,
the

    shipwright, or the carpenter?
  Other. The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand

    tenants.
  Clown. I like thy wit well, in good faith. The gallows does
well.
    But how does
 it well? It does well to those that do ill. Now,
    thou dost ill to say the gallows is built str
onger than the
    church. Argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To't again,
come!
  Other. Who
 builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a
    carpenter?
  Clown. Ay, tell me that, and un
yoke.
  Other. Marry, now I can tell!
  Clown. To't.
  Other. Mass, I cannot tell.

           
      Enter Hamlet and Horatio afar off.

  Clown. Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your du
ll ass
will
    not mend his pace with beating; and when you are ask'd this
    question next, sa
y 'a grave-maker.' The houses he makes lasts
    till doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan; fetch me a
 stoup of
    liquor.
                                            [Exit Second Clown.]


      
                 [Clown digs and] sings.

       In youth when I did love, did love,
         Met
hought it was very sweet;
       To contract- O- the time for- a- my behove,
         O, methought
 there- a- was nothing- a- meet.

  Ham. Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings

at
    grave-making?
  Hor. Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.
  Ham. 'Tis e'en
 so. The hand of little employment hath the
daintier
    sense.
  Clown. (sings)
         But ag
e with his stealing steps
           Hath clawed me in his clutch,
         And hath shipped me in
til the land,
           As if I had never been such.
                                            
[Throws up a skull.]

  Ham. That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once. How
the
    kna
ve jowls it to the ground,as if 'twere Cain's jawbone,
that
    did the first murther! This might 
be the pate of a
Politician,
    which this ass now o'erreaches; one that would circumvent
God,

    might it not?
  Hor. It might, my lord.
  Ham. Or of a courtier, which could say 'Good morrow,
 sweet
lord!
    How dost thou, good lord?' This might be my Lord Such-a-one,
that
    prais'd m
y Lord Such-a-one's horse when he meant to beg it-
might
    it not?
  Hor. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. 
Why, e'en so! and now my Lady Worm's, chapless, and
knock'd
    about the mazzard with a sexton's 
spade. Here's fine
revolution,
    and we had the trick to see't. Did these bones cost no more
th
e
    breeding but to play at loggets with 'em? Mine ache to think
    on't.
  Clown. (Sings)
  
       A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,
           For and a shrouding sheet;
         O, a Pit of 
clay for to be made
           For such a guest is meet.
                                      Thr
ows up [another skull].

  Ham. There's another. Why may not that be the skull of a
lawyer?
    
Where be his quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, his
tenures,
    and his tricks? Why does he s
uffer this rude knave now to
knock
    him about the sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell

him
    of his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be in's time
a
    great buyer of land
, with his statutes, his recognizances,
his
    fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries. Is thi
s the fine
of
    his fines, and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his
fine
    pate full 
of fine dirt? Will his vouchers vouch him no more
of
    his purchases, and double ones too, than 
the length and
breadth
    of a pair of indentures? The very conveyances of his lands
will
    s
carcely lie in this box; and must th' inheritor himself have
no
    more, ha?
  Hor. Not a jot mo
re, my lord.
  Ham. Is not parchment made of sheepskins?
  Hor. Ay, my lord, And of calveskins too
.
  Ham. They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in
that. I
    will speak to this fel
low. Whose grave's this, sirrah?
  Clown. Mine, sir.

    [Sings] O, a pit of clay for to be made

              For such a guest is meet.

  Ham. I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in't.

  Clown. You lie out on't, sir, and therefore 'tis not yours.
    For my part, I do not lie in't,
 yet it is mine.
  Ham. Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine. 'Tis
for
    the dead
, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.
  Clown. 'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away again from m
e to you.
  Ham. What man dost thou dig it for?
  Clown. For no man, sir.
  Ham. What woman then?

  Clown. For none neither.
  Ham. Who is to be buried in't?
  Clown. One that was a woman, sir; 
but, rest her soul, she's
dead.
  Ham. How absolute the knave is! We must speak by the card, or
 
   equivocation will undo us. By the Lord, Horatio, this three
years
    I have taken note of it, 
the age is grown so picked that the
toe
    of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier 
he
galls
    his kibe.- How long hast thou been a grave-maker?
  Clown. Of all the days i' th' ye
ar, I came to't that day that
our
    last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.
  Ham. How long is th
at since?
  Clown. Cannot you tell that? Every fool can tell that. It was
the
    very day that y
oung Hamlet was born- he that is mad, and sent
    into England.
  Ham. Ay, marry, why was be sent
 into England?
  Clown. Why, because 'a was mad. 'A shall recover his wits
there;
    or, if 'a d
o not, 'tis no great matter there.
  Ham. Why?
  Clown. 'Twill not he seen in him there. There the
 men are as
mad as
    he.
  Ham. How came he mad?
  Clown. Very strangely, they say.
  Ham. Ho
w strangely?
  Clown. Faith, e'en with losing his wits.
  Ham. Upon what ground?
  Clown. Why, he
re in Denmark. I have been sexton here, man and
boy
    thirty years.
  Ham. How long will a man 
lie i' th' earth ere he rot?
  Clown. Faith, if 'a be not rotten before 'a die (as we have
many
 
   pocky corses now-a-days that will scarce hold the laying in,
I
    will last you some eight yea
r or nine year. A tanner will
last
    you nine year.
  Ham. Why he more than another?
  Clown. 
Why, sir, his hide is so tann'd with his trade that 'a
will
    keep out water a great while; and 
your water is a sore
decayer of
    your whoreson dead body. Here's a skull now. This skull hath

lien
    you i' th' earth three-and-twenty years.
  Ham. Whose was it?
  Clown. A whoreson, mad f
ellow's it was. Whose do you think it
was?
  Ham. Nay, I know not.
  Clown. A pestilence on him f
or a mad rogue! 'A pour'd a flagon
of
    Rhenish on my head once. This same skull, sir, was Yoric
k's
    skull, the King's jester.
  Ham. This?
  Clown. E'en that.
  Ham. Let me see. [Takes the
 skull.] Alas, poor Yorick! I knew
him,
    Horatio. A fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent 
fancy.
He
    hath borne me on his back a thousand times. And now how
abhorred
    in my imagina
tion it is! My gorge rises at it. Here hung
those
    lips that I have kiss'd I know not how oft. 
Where be your
gibes
    now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment that
    were wo
nt to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock
your
    own grinning? Quite chap- fall'n? Now
 get you to my lady's
    chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this
    favour s
he must come. Make her laugh at that. Prithee,
Horatio,
    tell me one thing.
  Hor. What's that
, my lord?
  Ham. Dost thou think Alexander look'd o' this fashion i' th'
earth?
  Hor. E'en so.

  Ham. And smelt so? Pah!
                                          [Puts down the skull.]
  Hor.
 E'en so, my lord.
  Ham. To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not
    imagination tr
ace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it
    stopping a bunghole?
  Hor. 'Twere to consider
 too curiously, to consider so.
  Ham. No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with
modest
y
    enough, and likelihood to lead it; as thus: Alexander died,
    Alexander was buried, Alexan
der returneth into dust; the dust
is
    earth; of earth we make loam; and why of that loam (where
to
he
    was converted) might they not stop a beer barrel?
    Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd
 to clay,
    Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.
    O, that that earth which kept the world
 in awe
    Should patch a wall t' expel the winter's flaw!
    But soft! but soft! aside! Here co
mes the King-

    Enter [priests with] a coffin [in funeral procession], King,
             Quee
n, Laertes, with Lords attendant.]

    The Queen, the courtiers. Who is this they follow?
    An
d with such maimed rites? This doth betoken
    The corse they follow did with desp'rate hand
    
Fordo it own life. 'Twas of some estate.
    Couch we awhile, and mark.
                          
               [Retires with Horatio.]

  Laer. What ceremony else?
  Ham. That is Laertes,
    
A very noble youth. Mark.
  Laer. What ceremony else?
  Priest. Her obsequies have been as far enl
arg'd
    As we have warranty. Her death was doubtful;
    And, but that great command o'ersways t
he order,
    She should in ground unsanctified have lodg'd
    Till the last trumpet. For charita
ble prayers,
    Shards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on her.
    Yet here she is allow'd 
her virgin rites,
    Her maiden strewments, and the bringing home
    Of bell and burial.
  Laer
. Must there no more be done?
  Priest. No more be done.
    We should profane the service of the 
dead
    To sing a requiem and such rest to her
    As to peace-parted souls.
  Laer. Lay her i' 
th' earth;
    And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
    May violets spring! I tell thee, churlis
h priest,
    A minist'ring angel shall my sister be
    When thou liest howling.
  Ham. What, th
e fair Ophelia?
  Queen. Sweets to the sweet! Farewell.
                                          
   [Scatters flowers.]
    I hop'd thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
    I thought thy bri
de-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
    And not have strew'd thy grave.
  Laer. O, treble woe
    
Fall ten times treble on that cursed head
    Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
    Depri
v'd thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,
    Till I have caught her once more in mine arms.
       
                                      Leaps in the grave.
    Now pile your dust upon the quick and
 dead
    Till of this flat a mountain you have made
    T' o'ertop old Pelion or the skyish head

    Of blue Olympus.
  Ham. [comes forward] What is he whose grief
    Bears such an emphasis? wh
ose phrase of sorrow
    Conjures the wand'ring stars, and makes them stand
    Like wonder-wounde
d hearers? This is I,
    Hamlet the Dane.                    [Leaps in after Laertes.
  Laer. The
 devil take thy soul!
                                            [Grapples with him].
  Ham. Thou
 pray'st not well.
    I prithee take thy fingers from my throat;
    For, though I am not splenit
ive and rash,
    Yet have I in me something dangerous,
    Which let thy wisdom fear. Hold off th
y hand!
  King. Pluck them asunder.
  Queen. Hamlet, Hamlet!
  All. Gentlemen!
  Hor. Good my lo
rd, be quiet.
             [The Attendants part them, and they come out of the
                   
                                      grave.]
  Ham. Why, I will fight with him upon this theme
  
  Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
  Queen. O my son, what theme?
  Ham. I lov'd Ophelia. Fort
y thousand brothers
    Could not (with all their quantity of love)
    Make up my sum. What wilt 
thou do for her?
  King. O, he is mad, Laertes.
  Queen. For love of God, forbear him!
  Ham. 'Sw
ounds, show me what thou't do.
    Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?
    Wo
o't drink up esill? eat a crocodile?
    I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?
    To outface m
e with leaping in her grave?
    Be buried quick with her, and so will I.
    And if thou prate of
 mountains, let them throw
    Millions of acres on us, till our ground,
    Singeing his pate aga
inst the burning zone,
    Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
    I'll rant as well as 
thou.
  Queen. This is mere madness;
    And thus a while the fit will work on him.
    Anon, as 
patient as the female dove
    When that her golden couplets are disclos'd,
    His silence will s
it drooping.
  Ham. Hear you, sir!
    What is the reason that you use me thus?
    I lov'd you e
ver. But it is no matter.
    Let Hercules himself do what he may,
    The cat will mew, and dog w
ill have his day.
Exit.
  King. I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.
                       
                            Exit Horatio.
    [To Laertes] Strengthen your patience in our last nig
ht's
speech.
    We'll put the matter to the present push.-
    Good Gertrude, set some watch ove
r your son.-
    This grave shall have a living monument.
    An hour of quiet shortly shall we se
e;
    Till then in patience our proceeding be.
                                                  
       Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A hall in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet and Horatio.

 
 Ham. So much for this, sir; now shall you see the other.
    You do remember all the circumstance?

  Hor. Remember it, my lord!
  Ham. Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting
    That would
 not let me sleep. Methought I lay
    Worse than the mutinies in the bilboes. Rashly-
    And pra
is'd be rashness for it; let us know,
    Our indiscretion sometime serves us well
    When our de
ep plots do pall; and that should learn us
    There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
    Rough-
hew them how we will-
  Hor. That is most certain.
  Ham. Up from my cabin,
    My sea-gown scarf
'd about me, in the dark
    Grop'd I to find out them; had my desire,
    Finger'd their packet, 
and in fine withdrew
    To mine own room again; making so bold
    (My fears forgetting manners) 
to unseal
    Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio
    (O royal knavery!), an exact comm
and,
    Larded with many several sorts of reasons,
    Importing Denmark's health, and England's 
too,
    With, hoo! such bugs and goblins in my life-
    That, on the supervise, no leisure bated
,
    No, not to stay the finding of the axe,
    My head should be struck off.
  Hor. Is't possi
ble?
  Ham. Here's the commission; read it at more leisure.
    But wilt thou bear me how I did pr
oceed?
  Hor. I beseech you.
  Ham. Being thus benetted round with villanies,
    Or I could make
 a prologue to my brains,
    They had begun the play. I sat me down;
    Devis'd a new commission
; wrote it fair.
    I once did hold it, as our statists do,
    A baseness to write fair, and lab
our'd much
    How to forget that learning; but, sir, now
    It did me yeoman's service. Wilt tho
u know
    Th' effect of what I wrote?
  Hor. Ay, good my lord.
  Ham. An earnest conjuration fro
m the King,
    As England was his faithful tributary,
    As love between them like the palm migh
t flourish,
    As peace should still her wheaten garland wear
    And stand a comma 'tween their 
amities,
    And many such-like as's of great charge,
    That, on the view and knowing of these c
ontents,
    Without debatement further, more or less,
    He should the bearers put to sudden dea
th,
    Not shriving time allow'd.
  Hor. How was this seal'd?
  Ham. Why, even in that was heave
n ordinant.
    I had my father's signet in my purse,
    Which was the model of that Danish seal;

    Folded the writ up in the form of th' other,
    Subscrib'd it, gave't th' impression, plac'd
 it safely,
    The changeling never known. Now, the next day
    Was our sea-fight; and what to t
his was sequent
    Thou know'st already.
  Hor. So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.
  Ham. 
Why, man, they did make love to this employment!
    They are not near my conscience; their defeat

    Does by their own insinuation grow.
    'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
    Betwee
n the pass and fell incensed points
    Of mighty opposites.
  Hor. Why, what a king is this!
  H
am. Does it not, thinks't thee, stand me now upon-
    He that hath kill'd my king, and whor'd my m
other;
    Popp'd in between th' election and my hopes;
    Thrown out his angle for my proper lif
e,
    And with such coz'nage- is't not perfect conscience
    To quit him with this arm? And is't
 not to be damn'd
    To let this canker of our nature come
    In further evil?
  Hor. It must b
e shortly known to him from England
    What is the issue of the business there.
  Ham. It will be
 short; the interim is mine,
    And a man's life is no more than to say 'one.'
    But I am very 
sorry, good Horatio,
    That to Laertes I forgot myself,
    For by the image of my cause I see

    The portraiture of his. I'll court his favours.
    But sure the bravery of his grief did put m
e
    Into a tow'ring passion.
  Hor. Peace! Who comes here?

                 Enter young Osric
, a courtier.

  Osr. Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
  Ham. I humbly thank you, 
sir. [Aside to Horatio] Dost know this
    waterfly?
  Hor. [aside to Hamlet] No, my good lord.
 
 Ham. [aside to Horatio] Thy state is the more gracious; for
'tis a
    vice to know him. He hath 
much land, and fertile. Let a beast
be
    lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at the king's 
mess.
'Tis
    a chough; but, as I say, spacious in the possession of dirt.

  Osr. Sweet lord, 
if your lordship were at leisure, I should
impart
    a thing to you from his Majesty.
  Ham. I w
ill receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit. Put
your
    bonnet to his right use. 'Tis for 
the head.
  Osr. I thank your lordship, it is very hot.
  Ham. No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the
 wind is northerly.
  Osr. It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
  Ham. But yet methinks it is 
very sultry and hot for my
complexion.
  Osr. Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry, as 'twere- 
I
cannot
    tell how. But, my lord, his Majesty bade me signify to you
that
    he has laid a g
reat wager on your head. Sir, this is the
matter-
  Ham. I beseech you remember.
                
           [Hamlet moves him to put on his hat.]
  Osr. Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good f
aith. Sir, here
is
    newly come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute
gentleman,
    full 
of most excellent differences, of very soft society and
    great showing. Indeed, to speak feeling
ly of him, he is the
card
    or calendar of gentry; for you shall find in him the
continent of

    what part a gentleman would see.
  Ham. Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you; though
, I

    know, to divide him inventorially would dozy th' arithmetic
of
    memory, and yet but 
yaw neither in respect of his quick sail.
    But, in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a s
oul of
great
    article, and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as, to
make
    true dict
ion of him, his semblable is his mirror, and who
else
    would trace him, his umbrage, nothing mo
re.
  Osr. Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
  Ham. The concernancy, sir? Why do we wra
p the gentleman in our
more
    rawer breath?
  Osr. Sir?
  Hor [aside to Hamlet] Is't not possi
ble to understand in
another
    tongue? You will do't, sir, really.
  Ham. What imports the nomi
nation of this gentleman?
  Osr. Of Laertes?
  Hor. [aside] His purse is empty already. All's gold
en words are
    spent.
  Ham. Of him, sir.
  Osr. I know you are not ignorant-
  Ham. I would y
ou did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would
not
    much approve me. Well, sir?
  Osr. You a
re not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is-
  Ham. I dare not confess that, lest I should compar
e with him in
    excellence; but to know a man well were to know himself.
  Osr. I mean, sir, for
 his weapon; but in the imputation laid on
him
    by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.
  Ham. W
hat's his weapon?
  Osr. Rapier and dagger.
  Ham. That's two of his weapons- but well.
  Osr. Th
e King, sir, hath wager'd with him six Barbary horses;
    against the which he has impon'd, as I t
ake it, six French
    rapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers,
and
    so. 
Three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy,
    very responsive to the hilts, most de
licate carriages, and of
    very liberal conceit.
  Ham. What call you the carriages?
  Hor. [as
ide to Hamlet] I knew you must be edified by the
margent
    ere you had done.
  Osr. The carriag
es, sir, are the hangers.
  Ham. The phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could
    ca
rry cannon by our sides. I would it might be hangers till
then.
    But on! Six Barbary horses aga
inst six French swords, their
    assigns, and three liberal-conceited carriages: that's the
Frenc
h
    bet against the Danish. Why is this all impon'd, as you call
it?
  Osr. The King, sir, hath
 laid that, in a dozen passes between
    yourself and him, he shall not exceed you three hits; he 
hath
    laid on twelve for nine, and it would come to immediate trial
    if your lordship would 
vouchsafe the answer.
  Ham. How if I answer no?
  Osr. I mean, my lord, the opposition of your pe
rson in trial.
  Ham. Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please his
Majesty,
    it is the 
breathing time of day with me. Let the foils be
    brought, the gentleman willing, and the King ho
ld his
purpose,
    I will win for him if I can; if not, I will gain nothing but
my
    shame an
d the odd hits.
  Osr. Shall I redeliver you e'en so?
  Ham. To this effect, sir, after what flour
ish your nature will.
  Osr. I commend my duty to your lordship.
  Ham. Yours, yours. [Exit Osric.
] He does well to commend it
    himself; there are no tongues else for's turn.
  Hor. This lapwin
g runs away with the shell on his head.
  Ham. He did comply with his dug before he suck'd it. Thus
 has
he,
    and many more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age
dotes
    on, only got th
e tune of the time and outward habit of
encounter-
    a kind of yesty collection, which carries t
hem through and
    through the most fann'd and winnowed opinions; and do but
blow
    them to th
eir trial-the bubbles are out,

                            Enter a Lord.

  Lord. My lord, his 
Majesty commended him to you by young Osric,
who
    brings back to him, that you attend him in th
e hall. He sends
to
    know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you
will
    ta
ke longer time.
  Ham. I am constant to my purposes; they follow the King's
pleasure.
    If his 
fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or whensoever,
provided
    I be so able as now.
  Lord. The K
ing and Queen and all are coming down.
  Ham. In happy time.
  Lord. The Queen desires you to use 
some gentle entertainment to
    Laertes before you fall to play.
  Ham. She well instructs me.
 
                                                   [Exit Lord.]
  Hor. You will lose this wager, my
 lord.
  Ham. I do not think so. Since he went into France I have been
in
    continual practice.
 I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst
not
    think how ill all's here about my heart. But it
 is no matter.
  Hor. Nay, good my lord -
  Ham. It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gaing
iving as
    would perhaps trouble a woman.
  Hor. If your mind dislike anything, obey it. I will 
forestall
their
    repair hither and say you are not fit.
  Ham. Not a whit, we defy augury; the
re's a special providence
in
    the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not to come; if it
be

    not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will
come:
    the readiness is all. Si
nce no man knows aught of what he
leaves,
    what is't to leave betimes? Let be.

    Enter Kin
g, Queen, Laertes, Osric, and Lords, with other
              Attendants with foils and gauntlets.

               A table and flagons of wine on it.

  King. Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand
 from me.
                    [The King puts Laertes' hand into Hamlet's.]
  Ham. Give me your par
don, sir. I have done you wrong;
    But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.
    This presence knows
,
    And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd
    With sore distraction. What I have done

    That might your nature, honour, and exception
    Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.

    Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet.
    If Hamlet from himself be taken away,
    An
d when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
    Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
    Who
 does it, then? His madness. If't be so,
    Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
    His mad
ness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
    Sir, in this audience,
    Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd evi
l
    Free me so far in your most generous thoughts
    That I have shot my arrow o'er the house

    And hurt my brother.
  Laer. I am satisfied in nature,
    Whose motive in this case should st
ir me most
    To my revenge. But in my terms of honour
    I stand aloof, and will no reconcileme
nt
    Till by some elder masters of known honour
    I have a voice and precedent of peace
    T
o keep my name ungor'd. But till that time
    I do receive your offer'd love like love,
    And w
ill not wrong it.
  Ham. I embrace it freely,
    And will this brother's wager frankly play.
   
 Give us the foils. Come on.
  Laer. Come, one for me.
  Ham. I'll be your foil, Laertes. In mine 
ignorance
    Your skill shall, like a star i' th' darkest night,
    Stick fiery off indeed.
  L
aer. You mock me, sir.
  Ham. No, by this hand.
  King. Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin H
amlet,
    You know the wager?
  Ham. Very well, my lord.
    Your Grace has laid the odds o' th'
 weaker side.
  King. I do not fear it, I have seen you both;
    But since he is better'd, we hav
e therefore odds.
  Laer. This is too heavy; let me see another.
  Ham. This likes me well. These 
foils have all a length?
                                                Prepare to play.
  Osr. A
y, my good lord.
  King. Set me the stoups of wine upon that table.
    If Hamlet give the first o
r second hit,
    Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
    Let all the battlements their ordna
nce fire;
    The King shall drink to Hamlet's better breath,
    And in the cup an union shall he
 throw
    Richer than that which four successive kings
    In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me 
the cups;
    And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
    The trumpet to the cannoneer without,

    The cannons to the heavens, the heaven to earth,
    'Now the King drinks to Hamlet.' Come, beg
in.
    And you the judges, bear a wary eye.
  Ham. Come on, sir.
  Laer. Come, my lord.         
                       They play.
  Ham. One.
  Laer. No.
  Ham. Judgment!
  Osr. A hit, a very 
palpable hit.
  Laer. Well, again!
  King. Stay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
    
Here's to thy health.
               [Drum; trumpets sound; a piece goes off [within].
    Give hi
m the cup.
  Ham. I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile.
    Come. (They play.) Another hit.
 What say you?
  Laer. A touch, a touch; I do confess't.
  King. Our son shall win.
  Queen. He's
 fat, and scant of breath.
    Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows.
    The Queen carouses
 to thy fortune, Hamlet.
  Ham. Good madam!
  King. Gertrude, do not drink.
  Queen. I will, my l
ord; I pray you pardon me.          Drinks.
  King. [aside] It is the poison'd cup; it is too late.

  Ham. I dare not drink yet, madam; by-and-by.
  Queen. Come, let me wipe thy face.
  Laer. My l
ord, I'll hit him now.
  King. I do not think't.
  Laer. [aside] And yet it is almost against my c
onscience.
  Ham. Come for the third, Laertes! You but dally.
    Pray you pass with your best vio
lence;
    I am afeard you make a wanton of me.
  Laer. Say you so? Come on.                      
         Play.
  Osr. Nothing neither way.
  Laer. Have at you now!
                [Laertes woun
ds Hamlet; then] in scuffling, they
                    change rapiers, [and Hamlet wounds Laertes]
.
  King. Part them! They are incens'd.
  Ham. Nay come! again!                         The Queen 
falls.

  Osr. Look to the Queen there, ho!
  Hor. They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?

  Osr. How is't, Laertes?
  Laer. Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric.
    I am justly 
kill'd with mine own treachery.
  Ham. How does the Queen?
  King. She sounds to see them bleed.

  Queen. No, no! the drink, the drink! O my dear Hamlet!
    The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.  
               [Dies.]
  Ham. O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd.
    Treachery! Seek it out.

                                                [Laertes falls.]
  Laer. It is here, Hamlet. Hamlet
, thou art slain;
    No medicine in the world can do thee good.
    In thee there is not half an 
hour of life.
    The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
    Unbated and envenom'd. The foul p
ractice
    Hath turn'd itself on me. Lo, here I lie,
    Never to rise again. Thy mother's poison
'd.
    I can no more. The King, the King's to blame.
  Ham. The point envenom'd too?
    Then, v
enom, to thy work.                    Hurts the King.
  All. Treason! treason!
  King. O, yet defe
nd me, friends! I am but hurt.
  Ham. Here, thou incestuous, murd'rous, damned Dane,
    Drink off
 this potion! Is thy union here?
    Follow my mother.                                 King dies.

  Laer. He is justly serv'd.
    It is a poison temper'd by himself.
    Exchange forgiveness with
 me, noble Hamlet.
    Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
    Nor thine on me!        
                               Dies.
  Ham. Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.
    I am d
ead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!
    You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
    That a
re but mutes or audience to this act,
    Had I but time (as this fell sergeant, Death,
    Is str
ict in his arrest) O, I could tell you-
    But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;
    Thou liv'st; re
port me and my cause aright
    To the unsatisfied.
  Hor. Never believe it.
    I am more an ant
ique Roman than a Dane.
    Here's yet some liquor left.
  Ham. As th'art a man,
    Give me the 
cup. Let go! By heaven, I'll ha't.
    O good Horatio, what a wounded name
    (Things standing th
us unknown) shall live behind me!
    If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,
    Absent thee fro
m felicity awhile,
    And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
    To tell my story.     
    [March afar off, and shot within.]
    What warlike noise is this?
  Osr. Young Fortinbras, wi
th conquest come from Poland,
    To the ambassadors of England gives
    This warlike volley.
  
Ham. O, I die, Horatio!
    The potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit.
    I cannot live to hear
 the news from England,
    But I do prophesy th' election lights
    On Fortinbras. He has my dyi
ng voice.
    So tell him, with th' occurrents, more and less,
    Which have solicited- the rest 
is silence.             Dies.
  Hor. Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince,
    And f
lights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
                                                 [March wit
hin.]
    Why does the drum come hither?

    Enter Fortinbras and English Ambassadors, with Drum
,
                  Colours, and Attendants.

  Fort. Where is this sight?
  Hor. What is it you
 will see?
    If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
  Fort. This quarry cries on havoc. O
 proud Death,
    What feast is toward in thine eternal cell
    That thou so many princes at a sh
ot
    So bloodily hast struck.
  Ambassador. The sight is dismal;
    And our affairs from Engla
nd come too late.
    The ears are senseless that should give us hearing
    To tell him his comma
ndment is fulfill'd
    That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.
    Where should we have our t
hanks?
  Hor. Not from his mouth,
    Had it th' ability of life to thank you.
    He never gave 
commandment for their death.
    But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
    You from the Po
lack wars, and you from England,
    Are here arriv'd, give order that these bodies
    High on a 
stage be placed to the view;
    And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
    How these things 
came about. So shall you hear
    Of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts;
    Of accidental judgment
s, casual slaughters;
    Of deaths put on by cunning and forc'd cause;
    And, in this upshot, p
urposes mistook
    Fall'n on th' inventors' heads. All this can I
    Truly deliver.
  Fort. Let
 us haste to hear it,
    And call the noblest to the audience.
    For me, with sorrow I embrace 
my fortune.
    I have some rights of memory in this kingdom
    Which now, to claim my vantage do
th invite me.
  Hor. Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
    And from his mouth whose voice 
will draw on more.
    But let this same be presently perform'd,
    Even while men's minds are wi
ld, lest more mischance
    On plots and errors happen.
  Fort. Let four captains
    Bear Hamlet
 like a soldier to the stage;
    For he was likely, had he been put on,
    To have prov'd most r
oyally; and for his passage
    The soldiers' music and the rites of war
    Speak loudly for him.

    Take up the bodies. Such a sight as this
    Becomes the field but here shows much amiss.
  
  Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
            Exeunt marching; after the which a peal of ordnance
    
                                               are shot off.

ACT I. Scene I.
Elsinore. A platform before the Castle.

Enter two Sentinels-[f
irst,] Francisco, [who paces up and down
at his post; then] Bernardo, [who approaches him].

  Be
r. Who's there?
  Fran. Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.
  Ber. Long live the King!
  F
ran. Bernardo?
  Ber. He.
  Fran. You come most carefully upon your hour.
  Ber. 'Tis now struck 
twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.
  Fran. For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold,
    And
 I am sick at heart.
  Ber. Have you had quiet guard?
  Fran. Not a mouse stirring.
  Ber. Well, 
good night.
    If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
    The rivals of my watch, bid them make ha
ste.

                    Enter Horatio and Marcellus.

  Fran. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! 
Who is there?
  Hor. Friends to this ground.
  Mar. And liegemen to the Dane.
  Fran. Give you go
od night.
  Mar. O, farewell, honest soldier.
    Who hath reliev'd you?
  Fran. Bernardo hath my
 place.
    Give you good night.                                   Exit.
  Mar. Holla, Bernardo!

  Ber. Say-
    What, is Horatio there ?
  Hor. A piece of him.
  Ber. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome,
 good Marcellus.
  Mar. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
  Ber. I have seen nothing.

  Mar. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
    And will not let belief take hold of him
    Touchi
ng this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.
    Therefore I have entreated him along,
    With us to 
watch the minutes of this night,
    That, if again this apparition come,
    He may approve our e
yes and speak to it.
  Hor. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
  Ber. Sit down awhile,
    And let us
 once again assail your ears,
    That are so fortified against our story,
    What we two nights 
have seen.
  Hor. Well, sit we down,
    And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
  Ber. Last nigh
t of all,
    When yond same star that's westward from the pole
    Had made his course t' illume 
that part of heaven
    Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
    The bell then beating one-


                        Enter Ghost.

  Mar. Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!

  Ber. In the same figure, like the King that's dead.
  Mar. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horat
io.
  Ber. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.
  Hor. Most like. It harrows me with fear
 and wonder.
  Ber. It would be spoke to.
  Mar. Question it, Horatio.
  Hor. What art thou that 
usurp'st this time of night
    Together with that fair and warlike form
    In which the majesty 
of buried Denmark
    Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!
  Mar. It is offended.

  Ber. See, it stalks away!
  Hor. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!
                      
                               Exit Ghost.
  Mar. 'Tis gone and will not answer.
  Ber. How now, H
oratio? You tremble and look pale.
    Is not this something more than fantasy?
    What think you
 on't?
  Hor. Before my God, I might not this believe
    Without the sensible and true avouch
  
  Of mine own eyes.
  Mar. Is it not like the King?
  Hor. As thou art to thyself.
    Such was t
he very armour he had on
    When he th' ambitious Norway combated.
    So frown'd he once when, i
n an angry parle,
    He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
    'Tis strange.
  Mar. Thus twic
e before, and jump at this dead hour,
    With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
  Hor. In 
what particular thought to work I know not;
    But, in the gross and scope of my opinion,
    Thi
s bodes some strange eruption to our state.
  Mar. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows,

    Why this same strict and most observant watch
    So nightly toils the subject of the land,
  
  And why such daily cast of brazen cannon
    And foreign mart for implements of war;
    Why suc
h impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
    Does not divide the Sunday from the week.
    What m
ight be toward, that this sweaty haste
    Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day?
    Wh
o is't that can inform me?
  Hor. That can I.
    At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
 
   Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
    Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
    The
reto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
    Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet
    
(For so this side of our known world esteem'd him)
    Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd c
ompact,
    Well ratified by law and heraldry,
    Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands

    Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror;
    Against the which a moiety competent
    Was
 gaged by our king; which had return'd
    To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
    Had he been vanqu
isher, as, by the same cov'nant
    And carriage of the article design'd,
    His fell to Hamlet. 
Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
    Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
    Hath in the skirts of Norwa
y, here and there,
    Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
    For food and diet, to some ente
rprise
    That hath a stomach in't; which is no other,
    As it doth well appear unto our state,

    But to recover of us, by strong hand
    And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
    So
 by his father lost; and this, I take it,
    Is the main motive of our preparations,
    The sour
ce of this our watch, and the chief head
    Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
  Ber. I t
hink it be no other but e'en so.
    Well may it sort that this portentous figure
    Comes armed 
through our watch, so like the King
    That was and is the question of these wars.
  Hor. A mote 
it is to trouble the mind's eye.
    In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
    A little ere th
e mightiest Julius fell,
    The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead
    Did squeak and 
gibber in the Roman streets;
    As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood,
    Disasters in
 the sun; and the moist star
    Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
    Was sick almost 
to doomsday with eclipse.
    And even the like precurse of fierce events,
    As harbingers prece
ding still the fates
    And prologue to the omen coming on,
    Have heaven and earth together de
monstrated
    Unto our climature and countrymen.

                      Enter Ghost again.

  
  But soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again!
    I'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion
!
                                               Spreads his arms.
    If thou hast any sound, or 
use of voice,
    Speak to me.
    If there be any good thing to be done,
    That may to thee do
 ease, and, race to me,
    Speak to me.
    If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
    Which h
appily foreknowing may avoid,
    O, speak!
    Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
    Extorte
d treasure in the womb of earth
    (For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death),
        
                                         The cock crows.
    Speak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it
, Marcellus!
  Mar. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
  Hor. Do, if it will not stand.
  Ber
. 'Tis here!
  Hor. 'Tis here!
  Mar. 'Tis gone!
                                                
     Exit Ghost.
    We do it wrong, being so majestical,
    To offer it the show of violence;
 
   For it is as the air, invulnerable,
    And our vain blows malicious mockery.
  Ber. It was abo
ut to speak, when the cock crew.
  Hor. And then it started, like a guilty thing
    Upon a fearfu
l summons. I have heard
    The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
    Doth with his lofty and
 shrill-sounding throat
    Awake the god of day; and at his warning,
    Whether in sea or fire, 
in earth or air,
    Th' extravagant and erring spirit hies
    To his confine; and of the truth h
erein
    This present object made probation.
  Mar. It faded on the crowing of the cock.
    Som
e say that ever, 'gainst that season comes
    Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
    The 
bird of dawning singeth all night long;
    And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,
    Th
e nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,
    No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,

    So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
  Hor. So have I heard and do in part believe it.
  
  But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
    Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.
   
 Break we our watch up; and by my advice
    Let us impart what we have seen to-night
    Unto you
ng Hamlet; for, upon my life,
    This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
    Do you consent w
e shall acquaint him with it,
    As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
    Let's do't, I pra
y; and I this morning know
    Where we shall find him most conveniently.           Exeunt.





Scene II.
Elsinore. A room of state in the Castle.

Flourish. [Enter Claudius, King of Denmark,
 Gertrude the Queen,
Hamlet,
Polonius, Laertes and his sister Ophelia, [Voltemand, Cornelius,]
Lo
rds Attendant.

  King. Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
    The memory be green, an
d that it us befitted
    To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom
    To be contracted 
in one brow of woe,
    Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
    That we with wisest sorr
ow think on him
    Together with remembrance of ourselves.
    Therefore our sometime sister, now
 our queen,
    Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,
    Have we, as 'twere with a defeat
ed joy,
    With an auspicious, and a dropping eye,
    With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in m
arriage,
    In equal scale weighing delight and dole,
    Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'
d
    Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
    With this affair along. For all, our thanks.

    Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
    Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
    
Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
    Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
    Co
lleagued with this dream of his advantage,
    He hath not fail'd to pester us with message
    Im
porting the surrender of those lands
    Lost by his father, with all bands of law,
    To our mos
t valiant brother. So much for him.
    Now for ourself and for this time of meeting.
    Thus muc
h the business is: we have here writ
    To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,
    Who, impotent a
nd bedrid, scarcely hears
    Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress
    His further gait herei
n, in that the levies,
    The lists, and full proportions are all made
    Out of his subject; an
d we here dispatch
    You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,
    For bearers of this greeting t
o old Norway,
    Giving to you no further personal power
    To business with the King, more than
 the scope
    Of these dilated articles allow.            [Gives a paper.]
    Farewell, and let 
your haste commend your duty.
  Cor., Volt. In that, and all things, will we show our duty.
  King
. We doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell.
                                 Exeunt Voltemand and Cor
nelius.
    And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
    You told us of some suit. What is't, L
aertes?
    You cannot speak of reason to the Dane
    And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg,
 Laertes,
    That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
    The head is not more native to the h
eart,
    The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
    Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father
.
    What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
  Laer. My dread lord,
    Your leave and favour to return
 to France;
    From whence though willingly I came to Denmark
    To show my duty in your coronat
ion,
    Yet now I must confess, that duty done,
    My thoughts and wishes bend again toward Fran
ce
    And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
  King. Have you your father's leave? What 
says Polonius?
  Pol. He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
    By laboursome petition, an
d at last
    Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent.
    I do beseech you give him leave to go.

  King. Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,
    And thy best graces spend it at thy will!

    But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son-
  Ham. [aside] A little more than kin, and less than kin
d!
  King. How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
  Ham. Not so, my lord. I am too much i' t
h' sun.
  Queen. Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
    And let thine eye look like a frien
d on Denmark.
    Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
    Seek for thy noble father in the dust.

    Thou know'st 'tis common. All that lives must die,
    Passing through nature to eternity.
  
Ham. Ay, madam, it is common.
  Queen. If it be,
    Why seems it so particular with thee?
  Ham.
 Seems, madam, Nay, it is. I know not 'seems.'
    'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
    
Nor customary suits of solemn black,
    Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,
    No, nor the f
ruitful river in the eye,
    Nor the dejected havior of the visage,
    Together with all forms, 
moods, shapes of grief,
    'That can denote me truly. These indeed seem,
    For they are actions
 that a man might play;
    But I have that within which passeth show-
    These but the trappings
 and the suits of woe.
  King. 'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
    To give thes
e mourning duties to your father;
    But you must know, your father lost a father;
    That fathe
r lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
    In filial obligation for some term
    To do obsequio
us sorrow. But to persever
    In obstinate condolement is a course
    Of impious stubbornness. '
Tis unmanly grief;
    It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
    A heart unfortified, a mind i
mpatient,
    An understanding simple and unschool'd;
    For what we know must be, and is as comm
on
    As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
    Why should we in our peevish opposition
    Tak
e it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
    A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
    T
o reason most absurd, whose common theme
    Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
    Fr
om the first corse till he that died to-day,
    'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth
   
 This unprevailing woe, and think of us
    As of a father; for let the world take note
    You ar
e the most immediate to our throne,
    And with no less nobility of love
    Than that which dear
est father bears his son
    Do I impart toward you. For your intent
    In going back to school i
n Wittenberg,
    It is most retrograde to our desire;
    And we beseech you, bend you to remain

    Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
    Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
  Q
ueen. Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.
    I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wittenbe
rg.
  Ham. I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
  King. Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.
 
   Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come.
    This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet
    Sits s
miling to my heart; in grace whereof,
    No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day
    But the 
great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
    And the King's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,
    
Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.
                                Flourish. Exeunt all but Ham
let.
  Ham. O that this too too solid flesh would melt,
    Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!

    Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
    His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
    Ho
w weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
    Seem to me all the uses of this world!
    Fie on't! ah
, fie! 'Tis an unweeded garden
    That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
    Possess
 it merely. That it should come to this!
    But two months dead! Nay, not so much, not two.
    S
o excellent a king, that was to this
    Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
    That he m
ight not beteem the winds of heaven
    Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
    Must I r
emember? Why, she would hang on him
    As if increase of appetite had grown
    By what it fed on
; and yet, within a month-
    Let me not think on't! Frailty, thy name is woman!-
    A little mo
nth, or ere those shoes were old
    With which she followed my poor father's body
    Like Niobe,
 all tears- why she, even she
    (O God! a beast that wants discourse of reason
    Would have mo
urn'd longer) married with my uncle;
    My father's brother, but no more like my father
    Than 
I to Hercules. Within a month,
    Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
    Had left the flu
shing in her galled eyes,
    She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
    With such dexterity t
o incestuous sheets!
    It is not, nor it cannot come to good.
    But break my heart, for I must
 hold my tongue!

          Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo.

  Hor. Hail to your lordshi
p!
  Ham. I am glad to see you well.
    Horatio!- or I do forget myself.
  Hor. The same, my lor
d, and your poor servant ever.
  Ham. Sir, my good friend- I'll change that name with you.
    And
 what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?
    Marcellus?
  Mar. My good lord!
  Ham. I am very gla
d to see you.- [To Bernardo] Good even, sir.-

    But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?

  Hor. A truant disposition, good my lord.
  Ham. I would not hear your enemy say so,
    Nor shal
l you do my ear that violence
    To make it truster of your own report
    Against yourself. I kn
ow you are no truant.
    But what is your affair in Elsinore?
    We'll teach you to drink deep e
re you depart.
  Hor. My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
  Ham. I prithee do not mock m
e, fellow student.
    I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
  Hor. Indeed, my lord, it follo
wed hard upon.
  Ham. Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats
    Did coldly furnish fort
h the marriage tables.
    Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
    Or ever I had seen that da
y, Horatio!
    My father- methinks I see my father.
  Hor. O, where, my lord?
  Ham. In my mind'
s eye, Horatio.
  Hor. I saw him once. He was a goodly king.
  Ham. He was a man, take him for all
 in all.
    I shall not look upon his like again.
  Hor. My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.

  Ham. Saw? who?
  Hor. My lord, the King your father.
  Ham. The King my father?
  Hor. Season 
your admiration for a while
    With an attent ear, till I may deliver
    Upon the witness of the
se gentlemen,
    This marvel to you.
  Ham. For God's love let me hear!
  Hor. Two nights togeth
er had these gentlemen
    (Marcellus and Bernardo) on their watch
    In the dead vast and middle
 of the night
    Been thus encount'red. A figure like your father,
    Armed at point exactly, ca
p-a-pe,
    Appears before them and with solemn march
    Goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he
 walk'd
    By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
    Within his truncheon's length; whilst 
they distill'd
    Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
    Stand dumb and speak not to him. This
 to me
    In dreadful secrecy impart they did,
    And I with them the third night kept the watch
;
    Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
    Form of the thing, each word made true and g
ood,
    The apparition comes. I knew your father.
    These hands are not more like.
  Ham. But 
where was this?
  Mar. My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
  Ham. Did you not speak to it
?
  Hor. My lord, I did;
    But answer made it none. Yet once methought
    It lifted up it head
 and did address
    Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
    But even then the morning cock 
crew loud,
    And at the sound it shrunk in haste away
    And vanish'd from our sight.
  Ham. '
Tis very strange.
  Hor. As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
    And we did think it writ d
own in our duty
    To let you know of it.
  Ham. Indeed, indeed, sirs. But this troubles me.
   
 Hold you the watch to-night?
  Both [Mar. and Ber.] We do, my lord.
  Ham. Arm'd, say you?
  Bot
h. Arm'd, my lord.
  Ham. From top to toe?
  Both. My lord, from head to foot.
  Ham. Then saw yo
u not his face?
  Hor. O, yes, my lord! He wore his beaver up.
  Ham. What, look'd he frowningly.

  Hor. A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
  Ham. Pale or red?
  Hor. Nay, very pale.
  
Ham. And fix'd his eyes upon you?
  Hor. Most constantly.
  Ham. I would I had been there.
  Hor.
 It would have much amaz'd you.
  Ham. Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
  Hor. While one with
 moderate haste might tell a hundred.
  Both. Longer, longer.
  Hor. Not when I saw't.
  Ham. His
 beard was grizzled- no?
  Hor. It was, as I have seen it in his life,
    A sable silver'd.
  Ha
m. I will watch to-night.
    Perchance 'twill walk again.
  Hor. I warr'nt it will.
  Ham. If it
 assume my noble father's person,
    I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
    And bid
 me hold my peace. I pray you all,
    If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
    Let it be te
nable in your silence still;
    And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
    Give it an understand
ing but no tongue.
    I will requite your loves. So, fare you well.
    Upon the platform, 'twixt
 eleven and twelve,
    I'll visit you.
  All. Our duty to your honour.
  Ham. Your loves, as min
e to you. Farewell.
                                        Exeunt [all but Hamlet].
    My father
's spirit- in arms? All is not well.
    I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come!
    Ti
ll then sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,
    Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's
 eyes.
Exit.




Scene III.
Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius.

Enter Laertes and O
phelia.

  Laer. My necessaries are embark'd. Farewell.
    And, sister, as the winds give benefi
t
    And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
    But let me hear from you.
  Oph. Do you doubt th
at?
  Laer. For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,
    Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood;

    A violet in the youth of primy nature,
    Forward, not permanent- sweet, not lasting;
    T
he perfume and suppliance of a minute;
    No more.
  Oph. No more but so?
  Laer. Think it no mo
re.
    For nature crescent does not grow alone
    In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,

    The inward service of the mind and soul
    Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
    A
nd now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
    The virtue of his will; but you must fear,
    His gre
atness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
    For he himself is subject to his birth.
    He may no
t, as unvalued persons do,
    Carve for himself, for on his choice depends
    The safety and hea
lth of this whole state,
    And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd
    Unto the voice and
 yielding of that body
    Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
    It fits your 
wisdom so far to believe it
    As he in his particular act and place
    May give his saying deed
; which is no further
    Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
    Then weigh what loss you
r honour may sustain
    If with too credent ear you list his songs,
    Or lose your heart, or yo
ur chaste treasure open
    To his unmast'red importunity.
    Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear 
sister,
    And keep you in the rear of your affection,
    Out of the shot and danger of desire.

    The chariest maid is prodigal enough
    If she unmask her beauty to the moon.
    Virtue its
elf scopes not calumnious strokes.
    The canker galls the infants of the spring
    Too oft befo
re their buttons be disclos'd,
    And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
    Contagious blastmen
ts are most imminent.
    Be wary then; best safety lies in fear.
    Youth to itself rebels, thou
gh none else near.
  Oph. I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep
    As watchman to my heart.
 But, good my brother,
    Do not as some ungracious pastors do,
    Show me the steep and thorny 
way to heaven,
    Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
    Himself the primrose path of 
dalliance treads
    And recks not his own rede.
  Laer. O, fear me not!

                      
 Enter Polonius.

    I stay too long. But here my father comes.
    A double blessing is a doubl
e grace;
    Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
  Pol. Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for sh
ame!
    The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
    And you are stay'd for. There- my blessin
g with thee!
    And these few precepts in thy memory
    Look thou character. Give thy thoughts n
o tongue,
    Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.
    Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar
:
    Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
    Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops
 of steel;
    But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
    Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comr
ade. Beware
    Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,
    Bear't that th' opposed may beware of 
thee.
    Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice;
    Take each man's censure, but reserve th
y judgment.
    Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
    But not express'd in fancy; rich, not g
audy;
    For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
    And they in France of the best rank and stati
on
    Are most select and generous, chief in that.
    Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
    F
or loan oft loses both itself and friend,
    And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
    This 
above all- to thine own self be true,
    And it must follow, as the night the day,
    Thou canst
 not then be false to any man.
    Farewell. My blessing season this in thee!
  Laer. Most humbly 
do I take my leave, my lord.
  Pol. The time invites you. Go, your servants tend.
  Laer. Farewell
, Ophelia, and remember well
    What I have said to you.
  Oph. 'Tis in my memory lock'd,
    An
d you yourself shall keep the key of it.
  Laer. Farewell.                                         
 Exit.
  Pol. What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?
  Oph. So please you, something touching th
e Lord Hamlet.
  Pol. Marry, well bethought!
    'Tis told me he hath very oft of late
    Given 
private time to you, and you yourself
    Have of your audience been most free and bounteous.
    
If it be so- as so 'tis put on me,
    And that in way of caution- I must tell you
    You do not 
understand yourself so clearly
    As it behooves my daughter and your honour.
    What is between
 you? Give me up the truth.
  Oph. He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
    Of his affectio
n to me.
  Pol. Affection? Pooh! You speak like a green girl,
    Unsifted in such perilous circum
stance.
    Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
  Oph. I do not know, my lord, what I sh
ould think,
  Pol. Marry, I will teach you! Think yourself a baby
    That you have ta'en these te
nders for true pay,
    Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,
    Or (not to crack 
the wind of the poor phrase,
    Running it thus) you'll tender me a fool.
  Oph. My lord, he hath
 importun'd me with love
    In honourable fashion.
  Pol. Ay, fashion you may call it. Go to, go 
to!
  Oph. And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
    With almost all the holy vows of
 heaven.
  Pol. Ay, springes to catch woodcocks! I do know,
    When the blood burns, how prodigal
 the soul
    Lends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter,
    Giving more light than heat, exti
nct in both
    Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
    You must not take for fire. From thi
s time
    Be something scanter of your maiden presence.
    Set your entreatments at a higher rat
e
    Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
    Believe so much in him, that he is young,
  
  And with a larger tether may he walk
    Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia,
    Do not beli
eve his vows; for they are brokers,
    Not of that dye which their investments show,
    But mere
 implorators of unholy suits,
    Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
    The better to beg
uile. This is for all:
    I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth
    Have you so sland
er any moment leisure
    As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
    Look to't, I charge y
ou. Come your ways.
  Oph. I shall obey, my lord.
                                                
         Exeunt.




Scene IV.
Elsinore. The platform before the Castle.

Enter Hamlet, Hora
tio, and Marcellus.

  Ham. The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
  Hor. It is a nipping and a
n eager air.
  Ham. What hour now?
  Hor. I think it lacks of twelve.
  Mar. No, it is struck.
 
 Hor. Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws near the season
    Wherein the spirit held his wont to
 walk.
                   A flourish of trumpets, and two pieces go off.
    What does this mean, 
my lord?
  Ham. The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
    Keeps wassail, and the swagg'
ring upspring reels,
    And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
    The kettledrum and tr
umpet thus bray out
    The triumph of his pledge.
  Hor. Is it a custom?
  Ham. Ay, marry, is't;

    But to my mind, though I am native here
    And to the manner born, it is a custom
    More 
honour'd in the breach than the observance.
    This heavy-headed revel east and west
    Makes us
 traduc'd and tax'd of other nations;
    They clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase
    Soil 
our addition; and indeed it takes
    From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
    The p
ith and marrow of our attribute.
    So oft it chances in particular men
    That, for some viciou
s mole of nature in them,
    As in their birth,- wherein they are not guilty,
    Since nature ca
nnot choose his origin,-
    By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
    Oft breaking down the pales
 and forts of reason,
    Or by some habit that too much o'erleavens
    The form of plausive mann
ers, that these men
    Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
    Being nature's livery, or fo
rtune's star,
    Their virtues else- be they as pure as grace,
    As infinite as man may undergo
-
    Shall in the general censure take corruption
    From that particular fault. The dram of e'i
l
    Doth all the noble substance often dout To his own scandal.

                         Enter
 Ghost.

  Hor. Look, my lord, it comes!
  Ham. Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
    Be 
thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
    Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,

    Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
    Thou com'st in such a questionable shape
    That I
 will speak to thee. I'll call thee Hamlet,
    King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me?
    Let me
 not burst in ignorance, but tell
    Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,
    Have burst th
eir cerements; why the sepulchre
    Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
    Hath op'd his ponder
ous and marble jaws
    To cast thee up again. What may this mean
    That thou, dead corse, again
 in complete steel,
    Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
    Making night hideous, and we f
ools of nature
    So horridly to shake our disposition
    With thoughts beyond the reaches of ou
r souls?
    Say, why is this? wherefore? What should we do?
                                     
      Ghost beckons Hamlet.
  Hor. It beckons you to go away with it,
    As if it some impartment
 did desire
    To you alone.
  Mar. Look with what courteous action
    It waves you to a more r
emoved ground.
    But do not go with it!
  Hor. No, by no means!
  Ham. It will not speak. Then 
will I follow it.
  Hor. Do not, my lord!
  Ham. Why, what should be the fear?
    I do not set m
y life at a pin's fee;
    And for my soul, what can it do to that,
    Being a thing immortal as 
itself?
    It waves me forth again. I'll follow it.
  Hor. What if it tempt you toward the flood,
 my lord,
    Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
    That beetles o'er his base into the sea,

    And there assume some other, horrible form
    Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason

    And draw you into madness? Think of it.
    The very place puts toys of desperation,
    With
out more motive, into every brain
    That looks so many fadoms to the sea
    And hears it roar b
eneath.
  Ham. It waves me still.
    Go on. I'll follow thee.
  Mar. You shall not go, my lord.

  Ham. Hold off your hands!
  Hor. Be rul'd. You shall not go.
  Ham. My fate cries out
    And 
makes each petty artire in this body
    As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
                    
                            [Ghost beckons.]

    Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
    By
 heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!-
    I say, away!- Go on. I'll follow thee.
      
                                  Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet.
  Hor. He waxes desperate with imaginati
on.
  Mar. Let's follow. 'Tis not fit thus to obey him.
  Hor. Have after. To what issue will this
 come?
  Mar. Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
  Hor. Heaven will direct it.
  Mar. N
ay, let's follow him.
                                                         Exeunt.




Sce
ne V.
Elsinore. The Castle. Another part of the fortifications.

Enter Ghost and Hamlet.

  Ham
. Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak! I'll go no further.
  Ghost. Mark me.
  Ham. I will.
  Ghost.
 My hour is almost come,
    When I to sulph'rous and tormenting flames
    Must render up myself.

  Ham. Alas, poor ghost!
  Ghost. Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
    To what I shall 
unfold.
  Ham. Speak. I am bound to hear.
  Ghost. So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.

  Ham. What?
  Ghost. I am thy father's spirit,
    Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,

    And for the day confin'd to fast in fires,
    Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature

    Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid
    To tell the secrets of my prison house,
  
  I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
    Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,

    Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
    Thy knotted and combined locks to 
part,
    And each particular hair to stand on end
    Like quills upon the fretful porcupine.
  
  But this eternal blazon must not be
    To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
    If 
thou didst ever thy dear father love-
  Ham. O God!
  Ghost. Revenge his foul and most unnatural m
urther.
  Ham. Murther?
  Ghost. Murther most foul, as in the best it is;
    But this most foul,
 strange, and unnatural.
  Ham. Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
    As meditation 
or the thoughts of love,
    May sweep to my revenge.
  Ghost. I find thee apt;
    And duller sh
ouldst thou be than the fat weed
    That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
    Wouldst thou not
 stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.
    'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
    A serpent s
tung me. So the whole ear of Denmark
    Is by a forged process of my death
    Rankly abus'd. But
 know, thou noble youth,
    The serpent that did sting thy father's life
    Now wears his crown.

  Ham. O my prophetic soul!
    My uncle?
  Ghost. Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,

    With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts-
    O wicked wit and gifts, that have the po
wer
    So to seduce!- won to his shameful lust
    The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.
 
   O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there,
    From me, whose love was of that dignity
    That it
 went hand in hand even with the vow
    I made to her in marriage, and to decline
    Upon a wret
ch whose natural gifts were poor
    To those of mine!
    But virtue, as it never will be mov'd,

    Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
    So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,

    Will sate itself in a celestial bed
    And prey on garbage.
    But soft! methinks I scent t
he morning air.
    Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
    My custom always of the after
noon,
    Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
    With juice of cursed hebona in a vial,
    And
 in the porches of my ears did pour
    The leperous distilment; whose effect
    Holds such an en
mity with blood of man
    That swift as quicksilver it courses through
    The natural gates and 
alleys of the body,
    And with a sudden vigour it doth posset
    And curd, like eager droppings
 into milk,
    The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine;
    And a most instant tetter bark'd
 about,
    Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust
    All my smooth body.
    Thus was I
, sleeping, by a brother's hand
    Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd;
    Cut off e
ven in the blossoms of my sin,
    Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd,
    No reckoning made, but 
sent to my account
    With all my imperfections on my head.
  Ham. O, horrible! O, horrible! most
 horrible!
  Ghost. If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.
    Let not the royal bed of Denmark
 be
    A couch for luxury and damned incest.
    But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
    Tain
t not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
    Against thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven,
    A
nd to those thorns that in her bosom lodge
    To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once.
   
 The glowworm shows the matin to be near
    And gins to pale his uneffectual fire.
    Adieu, adi
eu, adieu! Remember me.                      Exit.

  Ham. O all you host of heaven! O earth! What
 else?
    And shall I couple hell? Hold, hold, my heart!
    And you, my sinews, grow not instant
 old,
    But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?
    Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a sea
t
    In this distracted globe. Remember thee?
    Yea, from the table of my memory
    I'll wipe
 away all trivial fond records,
    All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past
    That yout
h and observation copied there,
    And thy commandment all alone shall live
    Within the book a
nd volume of my brain,
    Unmix'd with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!
    O most pernicious woman!

    O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
    My tables! Meet it is I set it down
    Tha
t one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
    At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark.      
  [Writes.]
    So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word:
    It is 'Adieu, adieu! Remember me.'

    I have sworn't.
  Hor. (within) My lord, my lord!

                   Enter Horatio and Marce
llus.

  Mar. Lord Hamlet!
  Hor. Heaven secure him!
  Ham. So be it!
  Mar. Illo, ho, ho, my l
ord!
  Ham. Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.
  Mar. How is't, my noble lord?
  Hor. What new
s, my lord?
  Mar. O, wonderful!
  Hor. Good my lord, tell it.
  Ham. No, you will reveal it.
  
Hor. Not I, my lord, by heaven!
  Mar. Nor I, my lord.
  Ham. How say you then? Would heart of man
 once think it?
    But you'll be secret?
  Both. Ay, by heaven, my lord.
  Ham. There's neer a v
illain dwelling in all Denmark
    But he's an arrant knave.
  Hor. There needs no ghost, my lord,
 come from the grave
    To tell us this.
  Ham. Why, right! You are in the right!
    And so, wi
thout more circumstance at all,
    I hold it fit that we shake hands and part;
    You, as your b
usiness and desires shall point you,
    For every man hath business and desire,
    Such as it is
; and for my own poor part,
    Look you, I'll go pray.
  Hor. These are but wild and whirling wor
ds, my lord.
  Ham. I am sorry they offend you, heartily;
    Yes, faith, heartily.
  Hor. There'
s no offence, my lord.
  Ham. Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
    And much offence t
oo. Touching this vision here,
    It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.
    For your desir
e to know what is between us,
    O'ermaster't as you may. And now, good friends,
    As you are f
riends, scholars, and soldiers,
    Give me one poor request.
  Hor. What is't, my lord? We will.

  Ham. Never make known what you have seen to-night.
  Both. My lord, we will not.
  Ham. Nay, bu
t swear't.
  Hor. In faith,
    My lord, not I.
  Mar. Nor I, my lord- in faith.
  Ham. Upon my 
sword.
  Mar. We have sworn, my lord, already.
  Ham. Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.

          
       Ghost cries under the stage.

  Ghost. Swear.
  Ham. Aha boy, say'st thou so? Art thou the
re, truepenny?
    Come on! You hear this fellow in the cellarage.
    Consent to swear.
  Hor. P
ropose the oath, my lord.
  Ham. Never to speak of this that you have seen.
    Swear by my sword.

  Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
  Ham. Hic et ubique? Then we'll shift our ground.
    Come hither, ge
ntlemen,
    And lay your hands again upon my sword.
    Never to speak of this that you have hear
d:
    Swear by my sword.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear by his sword.
  Ham. Well said, old mole! Cans
t work i' th' earth so fast?
    A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends."
  Hor. O day an
d night, but this is wondrous strange!
  Ham. And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
    The
re are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
    Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
    Bu
t come!
    Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
    How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself

    (As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
    To put an antic disposition on),
    That you
, at such times seeing me, never shall,
    With arms encumb'red thus, or this head-shake,
    Or 
by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
    As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,
'
    Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'
    Or such ambiguous giving out,
 to note
    That you know aught of me- this is not to do,
    So grace and mercy at your most nee
d help you,
    Swear.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
                                                
   [They swear.]
  Ham. Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! So, gentlemen,
    With all my love I do com
mend me to you;
    And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
    May do t' express his love and friendi
ng to you,
    God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;
    And still your fingers on y
our lips, I pray.
    The time is out of joint. O cursed spite
    That ever I was born to set it 
right!
    Nay, come, let's go together.
                                                         
Exeunt.

Act II. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius.

Enter P
olonius and Reynaldo.

  Pol. Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
  Rey. I will, my lo
rd.
  Pol. You shall do marvell's wisely, good Reynaldo,
    Before You visit him, to make inquire

    Of his behaviour.
  Rey. My lord, I did intend it.
  Pol. Marry, well said, very well said. 
Look you, sir,
    Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
    And how, and who, what means, 
and where they keep,
    What company, at what expense; and finding
    By this encompassment and 
drift of question
    That they do know my son, come you more nearer
    Than your particular dema
nds will touch it.
    Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
    As thus, 'I know hi
s father and his friends,
    And in part him.' Do you mark this, Reynaldo?
  Rey. Ay, very well, 
my lord.
  Pol. 'And in part him, but,' you may say, 'not well.
    But if't be he I mean, he's ve
ry wild
    Addicted so and so'; and there put on him
    What forgeries you please; marry, none s
o rank
    As may dishonour him- take heed of that;
    But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual sli
ps
    As are companions noted and most known
    To youth and liberty.
  Rey. As gaming, my lord
.
  Pol. Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
    Drabbing. You may go so far.
  Rey.
 My lord, that would dishonour him.
  Pol. Faith, no, as you may season it in the charge.
    You 
must not put another scandal on him,
    That he is open to incontinency.
    That's not my meanin
g. But breathe his faults so quaintly
    That they may seem the taints of liberty,
    The flash 
and outbreak of a fiery mind,
    A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
    Of general assault.
  Re
y. But, my good lord-
  Pol. Wherefore should you do this?
  Rey. Ay, my lord,
    I would know t
hat.
  Pol. Marry, sir, here's my drift,
    And I believe it is a fetch of warrant.
    You layi
ng these slight sullies on my son
    As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' th' working,
    Mark y
ou,
    Your party in converse, him you would sound,
    Having ever seen in the prenominate crime
s
    The youth you breathe of guilty, be assur'd
    He closes with you in this consequence:
   
 'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman'-
    According to the phrase or the addition
    O
f man and country-
  Rey. Very good, my lord.
  Pol. And then, sir, does 'a this- 'a does- What wa
s I about to
say?
    By the mass, I was about to say something! Where did I leave?
  Rey. At 'cl
oses in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,' and
    gentleman.'
  Pol. At 'closes in the conseque
nce'- Ay, marry!
    He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman.
    I saw him yesterday, or t'other da
y,
    Or then, or then, with such or such; and, as you say,
    There was 'a gaming; there o'erto
ok in's rouse;
    There falling out at tennis'; or perchance,
    'I saw him enter such a house o
f sale,'
    Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
    See you now-
    Your bait of falsehood takes
 this carp of truth;
    And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
    With windlasses and with assay
s of bias,
    By indirections find directions out.
    So, by my former lecture and advice,
    
Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?
  Rey. My lord, I have.
  Pol. God b' wi' ye, fare ye
 well!
  Rey. Good my lord!                                    [Going.]
  Pol. Observe his inclina
tion in yourself.
  Rey. I shall, my lord.
  Pol. And let him ply his music.
  Rey. Well, my lord
.
  Pol. Farewell!
                                                  Exit Reynaldo.

           
            Enter Ophelia.

    How now, Ophelia? What's the matter?
  Oph. O my lord, my lord, I
 have been so affrighted!
  Pol. With what, i' th' name of God?
  Oph. My lord, as I was sewing in
 my closet,
    Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac'd,
    No hat upon his head, his stocking
s foul'd,
    Ungart'red, and down-gyved to his ankle;
    Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking e
ach other,
    And with a look so piteous in purport
    As if he had been loosed out of hell
   
 To speak of horrors- he comes before me.
  Pol. Mad for thy love?
  Oph. My lord, I do not know,

    But truly I do fear it.
  Pol. What said he?
  Oph. He took me by the wrist and held me hard;

    Then goes he to the length of all his arm,
    And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,

    He falls to such perusal of my face
    As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so.
    At last, a
 little shaking of mine arm,
    And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
    He rais'd a sigh
 so piteous and profound
    As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
    And end his being. That do
ne, he lets me go,
    And with his head over his shoulder turn'd
    He seem'd to find his way wi
thout his eyes,
    For out o' doors he went without their help
    And to the last bended their l
ight on me.
  Pol. Come, go with me. I will go seek the King.
    This is the very ecstasy of love
,
    Whose violent property fordoes itself
    And leads the will to desperate undertakings
    
As oft as any passion under heaven
    That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
    What, have y
ou given him any hard words of late?
  Oph. No, my good lord; but, as you did command,
    I did r
epel his letters and denied
    His access to me.
  Pol. That hath made him mad.
    I am sorry t
hat with better heed and judgment
    I had not quoted him. I fear'd he did but trifle
    And mea
nt to wrack thee; but beshrew my jealousy!
    By heaven, it is as proper to our age
    To cast b
eyond ourselves in our opinions
    As it is common for the younger sort
    To lack discretion. C
ome, go we to the King.
    This must be known; which, being kept close, might move
    More grief
 to hide than hate to utter love.
    Come.
                                                      
   Exeunt.

Scene II.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Flourish. [Enter King and Queen, Rosencr
antz and Guildenstern,
cum aliis.

  King. Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
    Moreo
ver that we much did long to see you,
    The need we have to use you did provoke
    Our hasty se
nding. Something have you heard
    Of Hamlet's transformation. So I call it,
    Sith nor th' ext
erior nor the inward man
    Resembles that it was. What it should be,
    More than his father's 
death, that thus hath put him
    So much from th' understanding of himself,
    I cannot dream of
. I entreat you both
    That, being of so young days brought up with him,
    And since so neighb
our'd to his youth and haviour,
    That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
    Some little
 time; so by your companies
    To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather
    So much as from occ
asion you may glean,
    Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus
    That, open'd, lies with
in our remedy.
  Queen. Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,
    And sure I am two men ther
e are not living
    To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
    To show us so much gentry 
and good will
    As to expend your time with us awhile
    For the supply and profit of our hope,

    Your visitation shall receive such thanks
    As fits a king's remembrance.
  Ros. Both your
 Majesties
    Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
    Put your dread pleasures more int
o command
    Than to entreaty.
  Guil. But we both obey,
    And here give up ourselves, in the 
full bent,
    To lay our service freely at your feet,
    To be commanded.
  King. Thanks, Rosen
crantz and gentle Guildenstern.
  Queen. Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz.
    And I be
seech you instantly to visit
    My too much changed son.- Go, some of you,
    And bring these ge
ntlemen where Hamlet is.
  Guil. Heavens make our presence and our practices
    Pleasant and help
ful to him!
  Queen. Ay, amen!
                 Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, [with some
 
                                                   Attendants].

                         Enter Po
lonius.

  Pol. Th' ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
    Are joyfully return'd.
  King. Th
ou still hast been the father of good news.
  Pol. Have I, my lord? Assure you, my good liege,
   
 I hold my duty as I hold my soul,
    Both to my God and to my gracious king;
    And I do think-
 or else this brain of mine
    Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
    As it hath us'd to do- t
hat I have found
    The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
  King. O, speak of that! That do I long t
o hear.
  Pol. Give first admittance to th' ambassadors.
    My news shall be the fruit to that gr
eat feast.
  King. Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
                                  
              [Exit Polonius.]
    He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found
    The head and s
ource of all your son's distemper.
  Queen. I doubt it is no other but the main,
    His father's 
death and our o'erhasty marriage.
  King. Well, we shall sift him.

              Enter Polonius,
 Voltemand, and Cornelius.

    Welcome, my good friends.
    Say, Voltemand, what from our broth
er Norway?
  Volt. Most fair return of greetings and desires.
    Upon our first, he sent out to s
uppress
    His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
    To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack,

    But better look'd into, he truly found
    It was against your Highness; whereat griev'd,
  
  That so his sickness, age, and impotence
    Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
    On
 Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys,
    Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,
    Makes v
ow before his uncle never more
    To give th' assay of arms against your Majesty.
    Whereon old
 Norway, overcome with joy,
    Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee
    And his commissi
on to employ those soldiers,
    So levied as before, against the Polack;
    With an entreaty, he
rein further shown,
                                                [Gives a paper.]
    That it m
ight please you to give quiet pass
    Through your dominions for this enterprise,
    On such reg
ards of safety and allowance
    As therein are set down.
  King. It likes us well;
    And at ou
r more consider'd time we'll read,
    Answer, and think upon this business.
    Meantime we thank
 you for your well-took labour.
    Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together.
    Most welco
me home!                       Exeunt Ambassadors.
  Pol. This business is well ended.
    My lieg
e, and madam, to expostulate
    What majesty should be, what duty is,
    Why day is day, night i
s night, and time is time.
    Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time.
    Therefore, sinc
e brevity is the soul of wit,
    And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
    I will be 
brief. Your noble son is mad.
    Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,
    What is't but to
 be nothing else but mad?
    But let that go.
  Queen. More matter, with less art.
  Pol. Madam,
 I swear I use no art at all.
    That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
    And pity 'ti
s 'tis true. A foolish figure!
    But farewell it, for I will use no art.
    Mad let us grant hi
m then. And now remains
    That we find out the cause of this effect-
    Or rather say, the caus
e of this defect,
    For this effect defective comes by cause.
    Thus it remains, and the remai
nder thus.
    Perpend.
    I have a daughter (have while she is mine),
    Who in her duty and o
bedience, mark,
    Hath given me this. Now gather, and surmise.
                                 
            [Reads] the letter.
    'To the celestial, and my soul's idol, the most beautified
   
   Ophelia,'-

    That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is a vile
      phrase.
   
 But you shall hear. Thus:
                                                        [Reads.]
    'I
n her excellent white bosom, these, &c.'
  Queen. Came this from Hamlet to her?
  Pol. Good madam,
 stay awhile. I will be faithful.     [Reads.]


          'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
     
       Doubt that the sun doth move;
          Doubt truth to be a liar;
            But never dou
bt I love.
      'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers; I have not art
to
    reckon my groa
ns; but that I love thee best, O most best,
believe
    it. Adieu.
      'Thine evermore, most de
ar lady, whilst this machine is to
him,

HAMLET.'

    This, in obedience, hath my daughter sho
wn me;
    And more above, hath his solicitings,
    As they fell out by time, by means, and place
,
    All given to mine ear.
  King. But how hath she
    Receiv'd his love?
  Pol. What do you 
think of me?
  King. As of a man faithful and honourable.
  Pol. I would fain prove so. But what m
ight you think,
    When I had seen this hot love on the wing
    (As I perceiv'd it, I must tell 
you that,
    Before my daughter told me), what might you,
    Or my dear Majesty your queen here,
 think,
    If I had play'd the desk or table book,
    Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb
,
    Or look'd upon this love with idle sight?
    What might you think? No, I went round to work

    And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
    'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star.
   
 This must not be.' And then I prescripts gave her,
    That she should lock herself from his resor
t,
    Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
    Which done, she took the fruits of my advice,

    And he, repulsed, a short tale to make,
    Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
    Thence 
to a watch, thence into a weakness,
    Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
    Into t
he madness wherein now he raves,
    And all we mourn for.
  King. Do you think 'tis this?
  Quee
n. it may be, very like.
  Pol. Hath there been such a time- I would fain know that-
    That I ha
ve Positively said ''Tis so,'
    When it prov'd otherwise.?
  King. Not that I know.
  Pol. [poi
nts to his head and shoulder] Take this from this, if
this
      be otherwise.
    If circumstanc
es lead me, I will find
    Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
    Within the centre.

  King. How may we try it further?
  Pol. You know sometimes he walks for hours together
    Here 
in the lobby.
  Queen. So he does indeed.
  Pol. At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him.
  
  Be you and I behind an arras then.
    Mark the encounter. If he love her not,
    And he not fr
om his reason fall'n thereon
    Let me be no assistant for a state,
    But keep a farm and carte
rs.
  King. We will try it.

                 Enter Hamlet, reading on a book.

  Queen. But lo
ok where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
  Pol. Away, I do beseech you, both away
    I'll bo
ard him presently. O, give me leave.
                       Exeunt King and Queen, [with Attendants
].
    How does my good Lord Hamlet?
  Ham. Well, God-a-mercy.
  Pol. Do you know me, my lord?
 
 Ham. Excellent well. You are a fishmonger.
  Pol. Not I, my lord.
  Ham. Then I would you were so
 honest a man.
  Pol. Honest, my lord?
  Ham. Ay, sir. To be honest, as this world goes, is to be 
one
man
    pick'd out of ten thousand.
  Pol. That's very true, my lord.
  Ham. For if the sun 
breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god
    kissing carrion- Have you a daughter?
  Pol. I have, 
my lord.
  Ham. Let her not walk i' th' sun. Conception is a blessing, but
not
    as your daught
er may conceive. Friend, look to't.
  Pol. [aside] How say you by that? Still harping on my daughte
r.
Yet
    he knew me not at first. He said I was a fishmonger. He is
far
    gone, far gone! An
d truly in my youth I suff'red much
extremity
    for love- very near this. I'll speak to him agai
n.- What do
you
    read, my lord?
  Ham. Words, words, words.
  Pol. What is the matter, my lor
d?
  Ham. Between who?
  Pol. I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
  Ham. Slanders, sir; fo
r the satirical rogue says here that old
men
    have grey beards; that their faces are wrinkled; 
their eyes
    purging thick amber and plum-tree gum; and that they have a
    plentiful lack of w
it, together with most weak hams. All
which,
    sir, though I most powerfully and potently believ
e, yet I
hold it
    not honesty to have it thus set down; for you yourself, sir,
    should be o
ld as I am if, like a crab, you could go backward.

  Pol. [aside] Though this be madness, yet the
re is a method
in't.-
   Will You walk out of the air, my lord?
  Ham. Into my grave?
  Pol. Ind
eed, that is out o' th' air. [Aside] How pregnant
sometimes
    his replies are! a happiness that 
often madness hits on,
which
    reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of.
I

    will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting
between
    him and my daughter.- My
 honourable lord, I will most humbly
take
    my leave of you.
  Ham. You cannot, sir, take from 
me anything that I will more
    willingly part withal- except my life, except my life, except
my

    life,

                    Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Pol. Fare you well, my lo
rd.
  Ham. These tedious old fools!
  Pol. You go to seek the Lord Hamlet. There he is.
  Ros. [t
o Polonius] God save you, sir!
                                                Exit [Polonius].


  Guil. My honour'd lord!
  Ros. My most dear lord!
  Ham. My excellent good friends! How dost tho
u, Guildenstern?
Ah,
    Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
  Ros. As the indifferent childr
en of the earth.
  Guil. Happy in that we are not over-happy.
    On Fortune's cap we are not the 
very button.
  Ham. Nor the soles of her shoe?
  Ros. Neither, my lord.
  Ham. Then you live abou
t her waist, or in the middle of her
    favours?
  Guil. Faith, her privates we.
  Ham. In the s
ecret parts of Fortune? O! most true! she is a
    strumpet. What news ?
  Ros. None, my lord, but
 that the world's grown honest.
  Ham. Then is doomsday near! But your news is not true. Let me
  
  question more in particular. What have you, my good friends,
    deserved at the hands of Fortune
 that she sends you to prison
    hither?
  Guil. Prison, my lord?
  Ham. Denmark's a prison.
  
Ros. Then is the world one.
  Ham. A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and
    
dungeons, Denmark being one o' th' worst.
  Ros. We think not so, my lord.
  Ham. Why, then 'tis n
one to you; for there is nothing either
good
    or bad but thinking makes it so. To me it is a pr
ison.
  Ros. Why, then your ambition makes it one. 'Tis too narrow for
your
    mind.
  Ham. O G
od, I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a
    king of infinite space, were it not tha
t I have bad dreams.
  Guil. Which dreams indeed are ambition; for the very substance
of
    the 
ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
  Ham. A dream itself is but a shadow.
  Ros. Truly, an
d I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality
that
    it is but a shadow's shadow.
  Ham. The
n are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and
outstretch'd
    heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall
 we to th' court? for, by
my
    fay, I cannot reason.
  Both. We'll wait upon you.
  Ham. No su
ch matter! I will not sort you with the rest of my
    servants; for, to speak to you like an hones
t man, I am most
    dreadfully attended. But in the beaten way of friendship,
what
    make you 
at Elsinore?
  Ros. To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
  Ham. Beggar that I am, I am even p
oor in thanks; but I thank
you;
    and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny.
W
ere
    you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free
    visitation? Come, deal justly
 with me. Come, come! Nay,
speak.
  Guil. What should we say, my lord?
  Ham. Why, anything- but 
to th' purpose. You were sent for; and
    there is a kind of confession in your looks, which your

modesties
    have not craft enough to colour. I know the good King and
Queen
    have sent for 
you.
  Ros. To what end, my lord?
  Ham. That you must teach me. But let me conjure you by the
ri
ghts
    of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the
    obligation of our ever-pres
erved love, and by what more dear
a
    better proposer could charge you withal, be even and direc
t
with
    me, whether you were sent for or no.
  Ros. [aside to Guildenstern] What say you?
  H
am. [aside] Nay then, I have an eye of you.- If you love me,
hold
    not off.
  Guil. My lord, w
e were sent for.
  Ham. I will tell you why. So shall my anticipation prevent your
    discovery, 
and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no
    feather. I have of late- but wherefore I know n
ot- lost all
my
    mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes
so
    heavily w
ith my disposition that this goodly frame, the
earth,
    seems to me a sterile promontory; this m
ost excellent canopy,
the
    air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this
majestical
 
   roof fretted with golden fire- why, it appeareth no other
thing
    to me than a foul and pesti
lent congregation of vapours. What
a
    piece of work is a man! how noble in reason! how infinite
 in
    faculties! in form and moving how express and admirable! in
    action how like an angel! 
in apprehension how like a god! the
    beauty of the world, the paragon of animals! And yet to me

what
    is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me- no, nor
woman
    neither, though by
 your smiling you seem to say so.
  Ros. My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.
  Ham. W
hy did you laugh then, when I said 'Man delights not me'?
  Ros. To think, my lord, if you delight 
not in man, what lenten
    entertainment the players shall receive from you. We coted
them
    o
n the way, and hither are they coming to offer you service.
  Ham. He that plays the king shall be 
welcome- his Majesty shall
    have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil
and

    target; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humorous man
shall
    end his part in peace; the
 clown shall make those laugh whose
    lungs are tickle o' th' sere; and the lady shall say her mi
nd
    freely, or the blank verse shall halt for't. What players are
    they?
  Ros. Even those 
you were wont to take such delight in, the
    tragedians of the city.
  Ham. How chances it they 
travel? Their residence, both in
    reputation and profit, was better both ways.
  Ros. I think t
heir inhibition comes by the means of the late
    innovation.
  Ham. Do they hold the same estima
tion they did when I was in
the
    city? Are they so follow'd?
  Ros. No indeed are they not.
 
 Ham. How comes it? Do they grow rusty?
  Ros. Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but t
here
is,
    sir, an eyrie of children, little eyases, that cry out on the
top
    of question a
nd are most tyrannically clapp'd for't. These
are now
    the fashion, and so berattle the common 
stages (so they call
    them) that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goosequills and
    dare sc
arce come thither.
  Ham. What, are they children? Who maintains 'em? How are they
    escoted? Wi
ll they pursue the quality no longer than they can
    sing? Will they not say afterwards, if they 
should grow
    themselves to common players (as it is most like, if their
means
    are no bette
r), their writers do them wrong to make them
exclaim
    against their own succession.
  Ros. Fai
th, there has been much to do on both sides; and the
nation
    holds it no sin to tarre them to c
ontroversy. There was, for
a
    while, no money bid for argument unless the poet and the
player

    went to cuffs in the question.
  Ham. Is't possible?
  Guil. O, there has been much throwing 
about of brains.
  Ham. Do the boys carry it away?
  Ros. Ay, that they do, my lord- Hercules and 
his load too.
  Ham. It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark,
and
    those that 
would make mows at him while my father lived give
    twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece
 for his picture
in
    little. 'Sblood, there is something in this more than
natural, if
    ph
ilosophy could find it out.

                     Flourish for the Players.

  Guil. There are t
he players.
  Ham. Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come!
Th'
    appurtenance
 of welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me
comply
    with you in this garb, lest my extent to th
e players (which I
    tell you must show fairly outwards) should more appear like
    entertainme
nt than yours. You are welcome. But my
uncle-father
    and aunt-mother are deceiv'd.
  Guil. In 
what, my dear lord?
  Ham. I am but mad north-north-west. When the wind is southerly
I
    know a
 hawk from a handsaw.

                            Enter Polonius.

  Pol. Well be with you, gen
tlemen!
  Ham. Hark you, Guildenstern- and you too- at each ear a hearer!
    That great baby you 
see there is not yet out of his swaddling
    clouts.
  Ros. Happily he's the second time come to 
them; for they say an
old
    man is twice a child.
  Ham. I will prophesy he comes to tell me of
 the players. Mark
it.-
   You say right, sir; a Monday morning; twas so indeed.
  Pol. My lord, 
I have news to tell you.
  Ham. My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an
actor in
  
  Rome-
  Pol. The actors are come hither, my lord.
  Ham. Buzz, buzz!
  Pol. Upon my honour-
  
Ham. Then came each actor on his ass-
  Pol. The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, come
dy,
    history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral,
    tragical-historical, tragica
l-comical-historical-pastoral;
scene
    individable, or poem unlimited. Seneca cannot be too heav
y,
nor
    Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these
are
    the only men.

  Ham. O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
  Pol. What treasure had he, my lor
d?
  Ham. Why,

         'One fair daughter, and no more,
           The which he loved passing 
well.'

  Pol. [aside] Still on my daughter.
  Ham. Am I not i' th' right, old Jephthah?
  Pol. 
If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I
    love passing well.
  Ham. Nay, that
 follows not.
  Pol. What follows then, my lord?
  Ham. Why,

           'As by lot, God wot,'


 and then, you know,

           'It came to pass, as most like it was.'

    The first row of
 the pious chanson will show you more; for
look
    where my abridgment comes.

                
     Enter four or five Players.

    You are welcome, masters; welcome, all.- I am glad to see
t
hee
    well.- Welcome, good friends.- O, my old friend? Why, thy
face is
    valanc'd since I sa
w thee last. Com'st' thou to' beard me in
    Denmark?- What, my young lady and mistress? By'r Lady
, your
    ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last by the
    altitude of a chopine.
 Pray God your voice, like a piece of
    uncurrent gold, be not crack'd within the ring.- Masters,
 you
are
    all welcome. We'll e'en to't like French falconers, fly at
    anything we see. We'l
l have a speech straight. Come, give us
a
    taste of your quality. Come, a passionate speech.
 
 1. Play. What speech, my good lord?
  Ham. I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never

acted;
    or if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember,
pleas'd
    not the million, '
twas caviary to the general; but it was (as
I
    receiv'd it, and others, whose judgments in such
 matters
cried in
    the top of mine) an excellent play, well digested in the
scenes,
    set d
own with as much modesty as cunning. I remember one said
    there were no sallets in the lines to 
make the matter
savoury,
    nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of
    affe
ctation; but call'd it an honest method, as wholesome as
    sweet, and by very much more handsome 
than fine. One speech
in't
    I chiefly lov'd. 'Twas AEneas' tale to Dido, and thereabout
of it

    especially where he speaks of Priam's slaughter. If it live
in
    your memory, begin at this
 line- let me see, let me see:

         'The rugged Pyrrhus, like th' Hyrcanian beast-'

    'T
is not so; it begins with Pyrrhus:

         'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
         B
lack as his purpose, did the night resemble
         When he lay couched in the ominous horse,
   
      Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd
         With heraldry more dismal. Head to 
foot
         Now is be total gules, horridly trick'd
         With blood of fathers, mothers, dau
ghters, sons,
         Bak'd and impasted with the parching streets,
         That lend a tyrannou
s and a damned light
         To their lord's murther. Roasted in wrath and fire,
         And thu
s o'ersized with coagulate gore,
         With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
         
Old grandsire Priam seeks.'

    So, proceed you.
  Pol. Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with goo
d accent and good
     discretion.

  1. Play. 'Anon he finds him,
      Striking too short at G
reeks. His antique sword,
      Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
      Repugnant to com
mand. Unequal match'd,
      Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide;
      But with the whi
ff and wind of his fell sword
      Th' unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
      Seeming
 to feel this blow, with flaming top
      Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
      Take
s prisoner Pyrrhus' ear. For lo! his sword,
      Which was declining on the milky head
      Of r
everend Priam, seem'd i' th' air to stick.
      So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
      And
, like a neutral to his will and matter,
      Did nothing.
      But, as we often see, against so
me storm,
      A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
      The bold winds speechless, a
nd the orb below
      As hush as death- anon the dreadful thunder
      Doth rend the region; so,
 after Pyrrhus' pause,
      Aroused vengeance sets him new awork;
      And never did the Cyclops
' hammers fall
      On Mars's armour, forg'd for proof eterne,
      With less remorse than Pyrrh
us' bleeding sword
      Now falls on Priam.
      Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods,

      In general synod take away her power;
      Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,

      And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
      As low as to the fiends!

  Pol. T
his is too long.
  Ham. It shall to the barber's, with your beard.- Prithee say
on.
    He's for 
a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps. Say on;
come to
    Hecuba.

  1. Play. 'But who, O who
, had seen the mobled queen-'

  Ham. 'The mobled queen'?
  Pol. That's good! 'Mobled queen' is g
ood.

  1. Play. 'Run barefoot up and down, threat'ning the flames
      With bisson rheum; a clo
ut upon that head
      Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
      About her lank and all 
o'erteemed loins,
      A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up-
      Who this had seen, with t
ongue in venom steep'd
      'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have pronounc'd.
      But if t
he gods themselves did see her then,
      When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
      In Minc
ing with his sword her husband's limbs,
      The instant burst of clamour that she made
      (Un
less things mortal move them not at all)
      Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven
  
    And passion in the gods.'

  Pol. Look, whe'r he has not turn'd his colour, and has tears
in'
s
    eyes. Prithee no more!
  Ham. 'Tis well. I'll have thee speak out the rest of this
soon.-

    Good my lord, will you see the players well bestow'd? Do you
    hear? Let them be well us'd; f
or they are the abstract and
brief
    chronicles of the time. After your death you were better ha
ve
a
    bad epitaph than their ill report while you live.
  Pol. My lord, I will use them accord
ing to their desert.
  Ham. God's bodykins, man, much better! Use every man after his
    desert, 
and who should scape whipping? Use them after your
own
    honour and dignity. The less they deser
ve, the more merit is
in
    your bounty. Take them in.
  Pol. Come, sirs.
  Ham. Follow him, fr
iends. We'll hear a play to-morrow.
                 Exeunt Polonius and Players [except the First]
.
    Dost thou hear me, old friend? Can you play 'The Murther of
    Gonzago'?
  1. Play. Ay, my
 lord.
  Ham. We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need, study a
    speech of some dozen 
or sixteen lines which I would set down
and
    insert in't, could you not?
  1. Play. Ay, my lor
d.
  Ham. Very well. Follow that lord- and look you mock him not.
                                
            [Exit First Player.]
    My good friends, I'll leave you till night. You are welcome
t
o
    Elsinore.
  Ros. Good my lord!
  Ham. Ay, so, God b' wi' ye!
                            [
Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
    Now I am alone.
    O what a rogue and peasant slave am I!

    Is it not monstrous that this player here,
    But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
    
Could force his soul so to his own conceit
    That, from her working, all his visage wann'd,
    
Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
    A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
   
 With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!
    For Hecuba!
    What's Hecuba to him, or he t
o Hecuba,
    That he should weep for her? What would he do,
    Had he the motive and the cue for
 passion
    That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
    And cleave the general ear with 
horrid speech;
    Make mad the guilty and appal the free,
    Confound the ignorant, and amaze in
deed
    The very faculties of eyes and ears.
    Yet I,
    A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, pea
k
    Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
    And can say nothing! No, not for a king,
  
  Upon whose property and most dear life
    A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
    Who call
s me villain? breaks my pate across?
    Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?
    Tweaks m
e by th' nose? gives me the lie i' th' throat
    As deep as to the lungs? Who does me this, ha?
 
   'Swounds, I should take it! for it cannot be
    But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall
    To m
ake oppression bitter, or ere this
    I should have fatted all the region kites
    With this sla
ve's offal. Bloody bawdy villain!
    Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
    O
, vengeance!
    Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
    That I, the son of a dear father m
urther'd,
    Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
    Must (like a whore) unpack my heart w
ith words
    And fall a-cursing like a very drab,
    A scullion!
    Fie upon't! foh! About, my
 brain! Hum, I have heard
    That guilty creatures, sitting at a play,
    Have by the very cunni
ng of the scene
    Been struck so to the soul that presently
    They have proclaim'd their malef
actions;
    For murther, though it have no tongue, will speak
    With most miraculous organ, I'l
l have these Players
    Play something like the murther of my father
    Before mine uncle. I'll 
observe his looks;
    I'll tent him to the quick. If he but blench,
    I know my course. The spi
rit that I have seen
    May be a devil; and the devil hath power
    T' assume a pleasing shape; 
yea, and perhaps
    Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
    As he is very potent with such spir
its,
    Abuses me to damn me. I'll have grounds
    More relative than this. The play's the thing

    Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King.         Exit.

ACT III. Sce
ne I.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz, Guilden
stern,
and Lords.

  King. And can you by no drift of circumstance
    Get from him why he puts 
on this confusion,
    Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
    With turbulent and dangerous l
unacy?
  Ros. He does confess he feels himself distracted,
    But from what cause he will by no m
eans speak.
  Guil. Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
    But with a crafty madness keeps 
aloof
    When we would bring him on to some confession
    Of his true state.
  Queen. Did he re
ceive you well?
  Ros. Most like a gentleman.
  Guil. But with much forcing of his disposition.
 
 Ros. Niggard of question, but of our demands
    Most free in his reply.
  Queen. Did you assay h
im
    To any pastime?
  Ros. Madam, it so fell out that certain players
    We o'erraught on the
 way. Of these we told him,
    And there did seem in him a kind of joy
    To hear of it. They ar
e here about the court,
    And, as I think, they have already order
    This night to play before
 him.
  Pol. 'Tis most true;
    And he beseech'd me to entreat your Majesties
    To hear and se
e the matter.
  King. With all my heart, and it doth much content me
    To hear him so inclin'd.

    Good gentlemen, give him a further edge
    And drive his purpose on to these delights.
  Ros
. We shall, my lord.
                            Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
  King. Swee
t Gertrude, leave us too;
    For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
    That he, as 'twere b
y accident, may here
    Affront Ophelia.
    Her father and myself (lawful espials)
    Will so 
bestow ourselves that, seeing unseen,
    We may of their encounter frankly judge
    And gather b
y him, as he is behav'd,
    If't be th' affliction of his love, or no,
    That thus he suffers f
or.
  Queen. I shall obey you;
    And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
    That your good beaut
ies be the happy cause
    Of Hamlet's wildness. So shall I hope your virtues
    Will bring him t
o his wonted way again,
    To both your honours.
  Oph. Madam, I wish it may.
                  
                                 [Exit Queen.]
  Pol. Ophelia, walk you here.- Gracious, so please 
you,
    We will bestow ourselves.- [To Ophelia] Read on this book,
    That show of such an exerc
ise may colour
    Your loneliness.- We are oft to blame in this,
    'Tis too much prov'd, that w
ith devotion's visage
    And pious action we do sugar o'er
    The Devil himself.
  King. [aside
] O, 'tis too true!
    How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
    The harlot's che
ek, beautied with plast'ring art,
    Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
    Than is my d
eed to my most painted word.
    O heavy burthen!
  Pol. I hear him coming. Let's withdraw, my lor
d.
                                      Exeunt King and Polonius].

                           E
nter Hamlet.

  Ham. To be, or not to be- that is the question:
    Whether 'tis nobler in the mi
nd to suffer
    The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
    Or to take arms against a sea of 
troubles,
    And by opposing end them. To die- to sleep-
    No more; and by a sleep to say we en
d
    The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks
    That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummatio
n
    Devoutly to be wish'd. To die- to sleep.
    To sleep- perchance to dream: ay, there's the r
ub!
    For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
    When we have shuffled off this mortal 
coil,
    Must give us pause. There's the respect
    That makes calamity of so long life.
    Fo
r who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
    Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely
,
    The pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay,
    The insolence of office, and the spurns
  
  That patient merit of th' unworthy takes,
    When he himself might his quietus make
    With a 
bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear,
    To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
    But that
 the dread of something after death-
    The undiscover'd country, from whose bourn
    No travell
er returns- puzzles the will,
    And makes us rather bear those ills we have
    Than fly to othe
rs that we know not of?
    Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
    And thus the native h
ue of resolution
    Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
    And enterprises of great 
pith and moment
    With this regard their currents turn awry
    And lose the name of action.- So
ft you now!
    The fair Ophelia!- Nymph, in thy orisons
    Be all my sins rememb'red.
  Oph. Go
od my lord,
    How does your honour for this many a day?
  Ham. I humbly thank you; well, well, w
ell.
  Oph. My lord, I have remembrances of yours
    That I have longed long to re-deliver.
    
I pray you, now receive them.
  Ham. No, not I!
    I never gave you aught.
  Oph. My honour'd lo
rd, you know right well you did,
    And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd
    As made t
he things more rich. Their perfume lost,
    Take these again; for to the noble mind
    Rich gift
s wax poor when givers prove unkind.
    There, my lord.
  Ham. Ha, ha! Are you honest?
  Oph. My
 lord?
  Ham. Are you fair?
  Oph. What means your lordship?
  Ham. That if you be honest and fai
r, your honesty should admit
no
    discourse to your beauty.
  Oph. Could beauty, my lord, have 
better commerce than with
honesty?
  Ham. Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform

    honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty
can
    translate beauty into hi
s likeness. This was sometime a
paradox,
    but now the time gives it proof. I did love you once.

  Oph. Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
  Ham. You should not have believ'd me; for virtu
e cannot so
    inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it. I loved
you
    not.
  Oph. I
 was the more deceived.
  Ham. Get thee to a nunnery! Why wouldst thou be a breeder of
    sinners
? I am myself indifferent honest, but yet I could
accuse
    me of such things that it were better
 my mother had not borne
me.
    I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more offences at
my

    beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give
    them shape, or time to act 
them in. What should such fellows
as I
    do, crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant kn
aves
all;
    believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where's your
    father?
  Oph. At h
ome, my lord.
  Ham. Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool
    nowhere but in'
s own house. Farewell.
  Oph. O, help him, you sweet heavens!
  Ham. If thou dost marry, I'll give
 thee this plague for thy
dowry:
    be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not
es
cape
    calumny. Get thee to a nunnery. Go, farewell. Or if thou wilt
    needs marry, marry a fo
ol; for wise men know well enough what
    monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go; and quickly
 too.
    Farewell.
  Oph. O heavenly powers, restore him!
  Ham. I have heard of your paintings 
too, well enough. God hath
    given you one face, and you make yourselves another. You jig,
you

    amble, and you lisp; you nickname God's creatures and make
your
    wantonness your ignorance.
 Go to, I'll no more on't! it hath
made
    me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages. Those t
hat are
    married already- all but one- shall live; the rest shall keep
as
    they are. To a n
unnery, go.                            Exit.
  Oph. O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
    T
he courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword,
    Th' expectancy and rose of the fair st
ate,
    The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
    Th' observ'd of all observers- quite, qui
te down!
    And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
    That suck'd the honey of his music vow
s,
    Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
    Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and
 harsh;
    That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
    Blasted with ecstasy. O, woe is me

    T' have seen what I have seen, see what I see!

                   Enter King and Polonius.


  King. Love? his affections do not that way tend;
    Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a
 little,
    Was not like madness. There's something in his soul
    O'er which his melancholy sit
s on brood;
    And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
    Will be some danger; which for to pr
event,
    I have in quick determination
    Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England
   
 For the demand of our neglected tribute.
    Haply the seas, and countries different,
    With va
riable objects, shall expel
    This something-settled matter in his heart,
    Whereon his brains
 still beating puts him thus
    From fashion of himself. What think you on't?
  Pol. It shall do 
well. But yet do I believe
    The origin and commencement of his grief
    Sprung from neglected 
love.- How now, Ophelia?
    You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said.
    We heard it all.- My 
lord, do as you please;
    But if you hold it fit, after the play
    Let his queen mother all al
one entreat him
    To show his grief. Let her be round with him;
    And I'll be plac'd so please
 you, in the ear
    Of all their conference. If she find him not,
    To England send him; or con
fine him where
    Your wisdom best shall think.
  King. It shall be so.
    Madness in great one
s must not unwatch'd go.         Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. hall in the Castle.

Enter 
Hamlet and three of the Players.

  Ham. Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounc'd it to you,

    trippingly on the tongue. But if you mouth it, as many of our
    players do, I had as live th
e town crier spoke my lines. Nor
do
    not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all

    gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and (as I may say)
    whirlwind of your passion, y
ou must acquire and beget a
    temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to
the
 
   soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion
to
    tatters, to very rags, to 
split the cars of the groundlings,
who
    (for the most part) are capable of nothing but inexplic
able
dumb
    shows and noise. I would have such a fellow whipp'd for
o'erdoing
    Termagant. I
t out-herods Herod. Pray you avoid it.
  Player. I warrant your honour.
  Ham. Be not too tame nei
ther; but let your own discretion be
your
    tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the 
action;
with
    this special observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of
    nature: for an
ything so overdone is from the purpose of
playing,
    whose end, both at the first and now, was a
nd is, to hold, as
    'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show Virtue her own
feature,
    scorn
 her own image, and the very age and body of the time
his
    form and pressure. Now this overdone
, or come tardy off,
though
    it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious
    gr
ieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance
    o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. 
O, there be players that
I
    have seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly (not
to

    speak it profanely), that, neither having the accent of
    Christians, nor the gait of Christi
an, pagan, nor man, have
so
    strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of Nature's
    jo
urneymen had made men, and not made them well, they
imitated
    humanity so abominably.
  Player
. I hope we have reform'd that indifferently with us,
sir.
  Ham. O, reform it altogether! And let
 those that play your
clowns
    speak no more than is set down for them. For there be of them
  
  that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren
    spectators to laugh too, though
 in the mean time some
necessary
    question of the play be then to be considered. That's
villan
ous
    and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it.
Go
    make you ready.
     
                                            Exeunt Players.

            Enter Polonius, Rosencran
tz, and Guildenstern.

    How now, my lord? Will the King hear this piece of work?
  Pol. And th
e Queen too, and that presently.
  Ham. Bid the players make haste, [Exit Polonius.] Will you two

    help to hasten them?
  Both. We will, my lord.                       Exeunt they two.
  Ham. W
hat, ho, Horatio!

                      Enter Horatio.

  Hor. Here, sweet lord, at your servic
e.
  Ham. Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
    As e'er my conversation cop'd withal.
  Hor. O
, my dear lord!
  Ham. Nay, do not think I flatter;
    For what advancement may I hope from thee,

    That no revenue hast but thy good spirits
    To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be
 flatter'd?
    No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
    And crook the pregnant hinges of 
the knee
    Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
    Since my dear soul was mistress 
of her choice
    And could of men distinguish, her election
    Hath seal'd thee for herself. For
 thou hast been
    As one, in suff'ring all, that suffers nothing;
    A man that Fortune's buffe
ts and rewards
    Hast ta'en with equal thanks; and blest are those
    Whose blood and judgment 
are so well commingled
    That they are not a pipe for Fortune's finger
    To sound what stop sh
e please. Give me that man
    That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
    In my heart's 
core, ay, in my heart of heart,
    As I do thee. Something too much of this I
    There is a play
 to-night before the King.
    One scene of it comes near the circumstance,
    Which I have told 
thee, of my father's death.
    I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
    Even with the very 
comment of thy soul
    Observe my uncle. If his occulted guilt
    Do not itself unkennel in one 
speech,
    It is a damned ghost that we have seen,
    And my imaginations are as foul
    As Vu
lcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
    For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,
    And after we
 will both our judgments join
    In censure of his seeming.
  Hor. Well, my lord.
    If he stea
l aught the whilst this play is playing,
    And scape detecting, I will pay the theft.

    Soun
d a flourish. [Enter Trumpets and Kettledrums. Danish
    march. [Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophe
lia, Rosencrantz,
      Guildenstern, and other Lords attendant, with the Guard
                  
     carrying torches.

  Ham. They are coming to the play. I must be idle.
    Get you a place.

  King. How fares our cousin Hamlet?
  Ham. Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish. I eat th
e
air,
    promise-cramm'd. You cannot feed capons so.
  King. I have nothing with this answer, H
amlet. These words are
not
    mine.
  Ham. No, nor mine now. [To Polonius] My lord, you play'd o
nce
    i' th' university, you say?
  Pol. That did I, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.
 
 Ham. What did you enact?
  Pol. I did enact Julius Caesar; I was kill'd i' th' Capitol;
Brutus
 
   kill'd me.
  Ham. It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf
there. Be
    the playe
rs ready.
  Ros. Ay, my lord. They stay upon your patience.
  Queen. Come hither, my dear Hamlet, 
sit by me.
  Ham. No, good mother. Here's metal more attractive.
  Pol. [to the King] O, ho! do yo
u mark that?
  Ham. Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
                                  [Sits down at
 Ophelia's feet.]

  Oph. No, my lord.
  Ham. I mean, my head upon your lap?
  Oph. Ay, my lord.

  Ham. Do you think I meant country matters?
  Oph. I think nothing, my lord.
  Ham. That's a fa
ir thought to lie between maids' legs.
  Oph. What is, my lord?
  Ham. Nothing.
  Oph. You are me
rry, my lord.
  Ham. Who, I?
  Oph. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. O God, your only jig-maker! What should a
 man do but be
merry?
    For look you how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father
died
    wi
thin 's two hours.
  Oph. Nay 'tis twice two months, my lord.
  Ham. So long? Nay then, let the de
vil wear black, for I'll have
a
    suit of sables. O heavens! die two months ago, and not
forgot
ten
    yet? Then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his
life
    half a year. But, by
'r Lady, he must build churches then; or
else
    shall he suffer not thinking on, with the hobby-
horse, whose

    epitaph is 'For O, for O, the hobby-horse is forgot!'

               Hautboys
 play. The dumb show enters.

    Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing
   
 him and he her. She kneels, and makes show of protestation
    unto him. He takes her up, and decl
ines his head upon her
    neck. He lays him down upon a bank of flowers. She, seeing
    him asle
ep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his
    crown, kisses it, pours poison in the sle
eper's ears, and
    leaves him. The Queen returns, finds the King dead, and makes
    passionate 
action. The Poisoner with some three or four
Mutes,
    comes in again, seem to condole with her. 
The dead body is
    carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with gifts; she
    seems harsh an
d unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts
    his love.
                                         
                Exeunt.

  Oph. What means this, my lord?
  Ham. Marry, this is miching malhecho;
 it means mischief.
  Oph. Belike this show imports the argument of the play.

                  
    Enter Prologue.

  Ham. We shall know by this fellow. The players cannot keep
counsel;
    t
hey'll tell all.
  Oph. Will he tell us what this show meant?
  Ham. Ay, or any show that you'll s
how him. Be not you asham'd
to
    show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means.
  Oph. You ar
e naught, you are naught! I'll mark the play.

    Pro. For us, and for our tragedy,
      Here s
tooping to your clemency,
      We beg your hearing patiently.                     [Exit.]

  Ham
. Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
  Oph. 'Tis brief, my lord.
  Ham. As woman's love.


              Enter [two Players as] King and Queen.

    King. Full thirty times hath Phoebus' 
cart gone round
      Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
      And thirty dozen moons w
ith borrowed sheen
      About the world have times twelve thirties been,
      Since love our hea
rts, and Hymen did our hands,
      Unite comutual in most sacred bands.
    Queen. So many journe
ys may the sun and moon
      Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
      But woe is me! you 
are so sick of late,
      So far from cheer and from your former state.
      That I distrust you
. Yet, though I distrust,
      Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must;
      For women's fear a
nd love holds quantity,
      In neither aught, or in extremity.
      Now what my love is, proof 
hath made you know;
      And as my love is siz'd, my fear is so.
      Where love is great, the l
ittlest doubts are fear;
      Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.
    King. Fa
ith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;
      My operant powers their functions leave to do.

      And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
      Honour'd, belov'd, and haply one as ki
nd
      For husband shalt thou-
    Queen. O, confound the rest!
      Such love must needs be t
reason in my breast.
      When second husband let me be accurst!
      None wed the second but wh
o killed the first.

  Ham. [aside] Wormwood, wormwood!

    Queen. The instances that second ma
rriage move
      Are base respects of thrift, but none of love.
      A second time I kill my hus
band dead
      When second husband kisses me in bed.
    King. I do believe you think what now yo
u speak;
      But what we do determine oft we break.
      Purpose is but the slave to memory,
 
     Of violent birth, but poor validity;
      Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree,

      But fall unshaken when they mellow be.
      Most necessary 'tis that we forget
      To pay
 ourselves what to ourselves is debt.
      What to ourselves in passion we propose,
      The pas
sion ending, doth the purpose lose.
      The violence of either grief or joy
      Their own enac
tures with themselves destroy.
      Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
      Grief jo
ys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
      This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
      
That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
      For 'tis a question left us yet to prove
,
      Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
      The great man down, you mark his fa
vourite flies,
      The poor advanc'd makes friends of enemies;
      And hitherto doth love on f
ortune tend,
      For who not needs shall never lack a friend,
      And who in want a hollow fri
end doth try,
      Directly seasons him his enemy.
      But, orderly to end where I begun,
    
  Our wills and fates do so contrary run
      That our devices still are overthrown;
      Our th
oughts are ours, their ends none of our own.
      So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
     
 But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
    Queen. Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven
 light,
      Sport and repose lock from me day and night,
      To desperation turn my trust and 
hope,
      An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope,
      Each opposite that blanks the face of j
oy
      Meet what I would have well, and it destroy,
      Both here and hence pursue me lasting 
strife,
      If, once a widow, ever I be wife!

  Ham. If she should break it now!

    King. 
'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile.
      My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguil
e
      The tedious day with sleep.
    Queen. Sleep rock thy brain,
                            
                        [He] sleeps.
      And never come mischance between us twain!
Exit.

  H
am. Madam, how like you this play?
  Queen. The lady doth protest too much, methinks.
  Ham. O, bu
t she'll keep her word.
  King. Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in't?
  Ham. No, 
no! They do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i'
th'
    world.
  King. What do you call the p
lay?
  Ham. 'The Mousetrap.' Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the
    image of a murther done 
in Vienna. Gonzago is the duke's
name;
    his wife, Baptista. You shall see anon. 'Tis a knavish 
piece
of
    work; but what o' that? Your Majesty, and we that have free
    souls, it touches us
 not. Let the gall'd jade winch; our
withers
    are unwrung.

                         Enter Lu
cianus.

    This is one Lucianus, nephew to the King.
  Oph. You are as good as a chorus, my lor
d.
  Ham. I could interpret between you and your love, if I could
see
    the puppets dallying.

  Oph. You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
  Ham. It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge
.
  Oph. Still better, and worse.
  Ham. So you must take your husbands.- Begin, murtherer. Pox,

leave
    thy damnable faces, and begin! Come, the croaking raven doth
    bellow for revenge.


    Luc. Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
      Confederate season, else no
 creature seeing;
      Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,
      With Hecate's ban th
rice blasted, thrice infected,
      Thy natural magic and dire property
      On wholesome life u
surp immediately.
                                   Pours the poison in his ears.

  Ham. He poi
sons him i' th' garden for's estate. His name's
Gonzago.
    The story is extant, and written in v
ery choice Italian. You
    shall see anon how the murtherer gets the love of Gonzago's
wife.
  O
ph. The King rises.
  Ham. What, frighted with false fire?
  Queen. How fares my lord?
  Pol. Giv
e o'er the play.
  King. Give me some light! Away!
  All. Lights, lights, lights!
               
               Exeunt all but Hamlet and Horatio.
  Ham.   Why, let the strucken deer go weep,
   
       The hart ungalled play;
         For some must watch, while some must sleep:
          Thus
 runs the world away.
    Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers- if the rest of
my
    fo
rtunes turn Turk with me-with two Provincial roses on my
raz'd
    shoes, get me a fellowship in a
 cry of players, sir?
  Hor. Half a share.
  Ham.   A whole one I!
         For thou dost know, O
 Damon dear,
           This realm dismantled was
         Of Jove himself; and now reigns here
 
          A very, very- pajock.
  Hor. You might have rhym'd.
  Ham. O good Horatio, I'll take the
 ghost's word for a thousand
    pound! Didst perceive?
  Hor. Very well, my lord.
  Ham. Upon th
e talk of the poisoning?
  Hor. I did very well note him.
  Ham.   Aha! Come, some music! Come, th
e recorders!
         For if the King like not the comedy,
         Why then, belike he likes it n
ot, perdy.
    Come, some music!

                Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Guil. 
Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.
  Ham. Sir, a whole history.
  Guil. The King, sir-
 
 Ham. Ay, sir, what of him?
  Guil. Is in his retirement, marvellous distemper'd.
  Ham. With drin
k, sir?
  Guil. No, my lord; rather with choler.
  Ham. Your wisdom should show itself more richer
 to signify this
to
    the doctor; for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps
    plunge h
im into far more choler.
  Guil. Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame, and
start
    
not so wildly from my affair.
  Ham. I am tame, sir; pronounce.
  Guil. The Queen, your mother, in
 most great affliction of
spirit
    hath sent me to you.
  Ham. You are welcome.
  Guil. Nay, g
ood my lord, this courtesy is not of the right
breed.
    If it shall please you to make me a whol
esome answer, I will
do
    your mother's commandment; if not, your pardon and my return
    shal
l be the end of my business.
  Ham. Sir, I cannot.
  Guil. What, my lord?
  Ham. Make you a whole
some answer; my wit's diseas'd. But, sir,
such
    answer as I can make, you shall command; or rat
her, as you
say,
    my mother. Therefore no more, but to the matter! My mother,
you
    say-
 
 Ros. Then thus she says: your behaviour hath struck her into
    amazement and admiration.
  Ham.
 O wonderful son, that can so stonish a mother! But is
there no
    sequel at the heels of this mo
ther's admiration? Impart.
  Ros. She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to
bed.

  Ham. We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any
    further trade with us?
  Ros
. My lord, you once did love me.
  Ham. And do still, by these pickers and stealers!
  Ros. Good m
y lord, what is your cause of distemper? You do
surely
    bar the door upon your own liberty, if 
you deny your griefs
to
    your friend.
  Ham. Sir, I lack advancement.
  Ros. How can that be,
 when you have the voice of the King
himself
    for your succession in Denmark?
  Ham. Ay, sir, 
but 'while the grass grows'- the proverb is
something
    musty.

                     Enter the
 Players with recorders.

    O, the recorders! Let me see one. To withdraw with you- why
do
   
 you go about to recover the wind of me, as if you would drive
me
    into a toil?
  Guil. O my l
ord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too
unmannerly.
  Ham. I do not well understand that. Will
 you play upon this
pipe?
  Guil. My lord, I cannot.
  Ham. I pray you.
  Guil. Believe me, I ca
nnot.
  Ham. I do beseech you.
  Guil. I know, no touch of it, my lord.
  Ham. It is as easy as l
ying. Govern these ventages with your
    fingers and thumbs, give it breath with your mouth, and i
t
will
    discourse most eloquent music. Look you, these are the stops.
  Guil. But these cannot
 I command to any utt'rance of harmony. I
    have not the skill.
  Ham. Why, look you now, how un
worthy a thing you make of me!
You
    would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you
w
ould
    pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound me from my
    lowest note to the top 
of my compass; and there is much
music,
    excellent voice, in this little organ, yet cannot you 
make it
    speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am easier to be play'd on than
a
    pipe? Call me wha
t instrument you will, though you can fret
me,
    you cannot play upon me.

                   
     Enter Polonius.

    God bless you, sir!
  Pol. My lord, the Queen would speak with you, and
 presently.
  Ham. Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
  Pol. By th' mass, 
and 'tis like a camel indeed.
  Ham. Methinks it is like a weasel.
  Pol. It is back'd like a weas
el.
  Ham. Or like a whale.
  Pol. Very like a whale.
  Ham. Then will I come to my mother by-and
-by.- They fool me to
the
    top of my bent.- I will come by-and-by.
  Pol. I will say so.      
                                Exit.
  Ham. 'By-and-by' is easily said.- Leave me, friends.
     
                                   [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]

    'Tis now the very witching time o
f night,
    When churchyards yawn, and hell itself breathes out
    Contagion to this world. Now 
could I drink hot blood
    And do such bitter business as the day
    Would quake to look on. Sof
t! now to my mother!
    O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever
    The soul of Nero enter thi
s firm bosom.
    Let me be cruel, not unnatural;
    I will speak daggers to her, but use none.

    My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites-
    How in my words somever she be shent,
    To giv
e them seals never, my soul, consent!             Exit.




Scene III.
A room in the Castle.


Enter King, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.

  King. I like him not, nor stands it safe with us

    To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;
    I your commission will forthwith dispatch,

    And he to England shall along with you.
    The terms of our estate may not endure
    Hazar
d so near us as doth hourly grow
    Out of his lunacies.
  Guil. We will ourselves provide.
    
Most holy and religious fear it is
    To keep those many many bodies safe
    That live and feed 
upon your Majesty.
  Ros. The single and peculiar life is bound
    With all the strength and armo
ur of the mind
    To keep itself from noyance; but much more
    That spirit upon whose weal depe
nds and rests
    The lives of many. The cesse of majesty
    Dies not alone, but like a gulf doth
 draw
    What's near it with it. It is a massy wheel,
    Fix'd on the summit of the highest moun
t,
    To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
    Are mortis'd and adjoin'd; which when i
t falls,
    Each small annexment, petty consequence,
    Attends the boist'rous ruin. Never alone

    Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.
  King. Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voya
ge;
    For we will fetters put upon this fear,
    Which now goes too free-footed.
  Both. We wi
ll haste us.
                                               Exeunt Gentlemen.

                  
 Enter Polonius.

  Pol. My lord, he's going to his mother's closet.
    Behind the arras I'll co
nvey myself
    To hear the process. I'll warrant she'll tax him home;
    And, as you said, and w
isely was it said,
    'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,
    Since nature makes the
m partial, should o'erhear
    The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege.
    I'll call upon
 you ere you go to bed
    And tell you what I know.
  King. Thanks, dear my lord.
              
                                  Exit [Polonius].
    O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven;

    It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,
    A brother's murther! Pray can I not,
    Though i
nclination be as sharp as will.
    My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent,
    And, like a ma
n to double business bound,
    I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
    And both neglect. 
What if this cursed hand
    Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,
    Is there not rain 
enough in the sweet heavens
    To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
    But to confront
 the visage of offence?
    And what's in prayer but this twofold force,
    To be forestalled ere
 we come to fall,
    Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;
    My fault is past. But, O, wha
t form of prayer
    Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murther'?
    That cannot be; since I 
am still possess'd
    Of those effects for which I did the murther-
    My crown, mine own ambiti
on, and my queen.
    May one be pardon'd and retain th' offence?
    In the corrupted currents of
 this world
    Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,
    And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize
 itself
    Buys out the law; but 'tis not so above.
    There is no shuffling; there the action l
ies
    In his true nature, and we ourselves compell'd,
    Even to the teeth and forehead of our 
faults,
    To give in evidence. What then? What rests?
    Try what repentance can. What can it n
ot?
    Yet what can it when one cannot repent?
    O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
   
 O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
    Art more engag'd! Help, angels! Make assay.
    Bo
w, stubborn knees; and heart with strings of steel,
    Be soft as sinews of the new-born babe!
  
  All may be well.                                  He kneels.

                         Enter Ham
let.

  Ham. Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
    And now I'll do't. And so he goes to h
eaven,
    And so am I reveng'd. That would be scann'd.
    A villain kills my father; and for tha
t,
    I, his sole son, do this same villain send
    To heaven.
    Why, this is hire and salary
, not revenge!
    He took my father grossly, full of bread,
    With all his crimes broad blown, 
as flush as May;
    And how his audit stands, who knows save heaven?
    But in our circumstance 
and course of thought,
    'Tis heavy with him; and am I then reveng'd,
    To take him in the pur
ging of his soul,
    When he is fit and seasoned for his passage?
    No.
    Up, sword, and kno
w thou a more horrid hent.
    When he is drunk asleep; or in his rage;
    Or in th' incestuous p
leasure of his bed;
    At gaming, swearing, or about some act
    That has no relish of salvation
 in't-
    Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,
    And that his soul may be as damn'
d and black
    As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays.
    This physic but prolongs thy sickly
 days.              Exit.
  King. [rises] My words fly up, my thoughts remain below.
    Words wit
hout thoughts never to heaven go.             Exit.




Scene IV.
The Queen's closet.

Enter
 Queen and Polonius.

  Pol. He will come straight. Look you lay home to him.
    Tell him his pr
anks have been too broad to bear with,
    And that your Grace hath screen'd and stood between
   
 Much heat and him. I'll silence me even here.
    Pray you be round with him.
  Ham. (within) Mot
her, mother, mother!
  Queen. I'll warrant you; fear me not. Withdraw; I hear him
coming.
       
                       [Polonius hides behind the arras.]

                          Enter Hamlet.


  Ham. Now, mother, what's the matter?
  Queen. Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
  
Ham. Mother, you have my father much offended.
  Queen. Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.

  Ham. Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
  Queen. Why, how now, Hamlet?
  Ham. What's t
he matter now?
  Queen. Have you forgot me?
  Ham. No, by the rood, not so!
    You are the Queen
, your husband's brother's wife,
    And (would it were not so!) you are my mother.
  Queen. Nay, 
then I'll set those to you that can speak.
  Ham. Come, come, and sit you down. You shall not budge
;
    You go not till I set you up a glass
    Where you may see the inmost part of you.
  Queen.
 What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murther me?
    Help, help, ho!
  Pol. [behind] What, ho! help, 
help, help!
  Ham. [draws] How now? a rat? Dead for a ducat, dead!
            [Makes a pass throu
gh the arras and] kills Polonius.
  Pol. [behind] O, I am slain!
  Queen. O me, what hast thou don
e?
  Ham. Nay, I know not. Is it the King?
  Queen. O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
  Ham
. A bloody deed- almost as bad, good mother,
    As kill a king, and marry with his brother.
  Que
en. As kill a king?
  Ham. Ay, lady, it was my word.
                         [Lifts up the arras 
and sees Polonius.]
    Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
    I took thee for thy bet
ter. Take thy fortune.
    Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.
    Leave wringing of your 
hands. Peace! sit you down
    And let me wring your heart; for so I shall
    If it be made of pe
netrable stuff;
    If damned custom have not braz'd it so
    That it is proof and bulwark agains
t sense.
  Queen. What have I done that thou dar'st wag thy tongue
    In noise so rude against me
?
  Ham. Such an act
    That blurs the grace and blush of modesty;
    Calls virtue hypocrite; t
akes off the rose
    From the fair forehead of an innocent love,
    And sets a blister there; ma
kes marriage vows
    As false as dicers' oaths. O, such a deed
    As from the body of contractio
n plucks
    The very soul, and sweet religion makes
    A rhapsody of words! Heaven's face doth g
low;
    Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
    With tristful visage, as against the doom,
   
 Is thought-sick at the act.
  Queen. Ah me, what act,
    That roars so loud and thunders in the 
index?
  Ham. Look here upon th's picture, and on this,
    The counterfeit presentment of two bro
thers.
    See what a grace was seated on this brow;
    Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himse
lf;
    An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
    A station like the herald Mercury
    New 
lighted on a heaven-kissing hill:
    A combination and a form indeed
    Where every god did seem
 to set his seal
    To give the world assurance of a man.
    This was your husband. Look you now
 what follows.
    Here is your husband, like a mildew'd ear
    Blasting his wholesome brother. H
ave you eyes?
    Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
    And batten on this moor? Ha! 
have you eyes
    You cannot call it love; for at your age
    The heyday in the blood is tame, it
's humble,
    And waits upon the judgment; and what judgment
    Would step from this to this? Se
nse sure you have,
    Else could you not have motion; but sure that sense
    Is apoplex'd; for m
adness would not err,
    Nor sense to ecstacy was ne'er so thrall'd
    But it reserv'd some quan
tity of choice
    To serve in such a difference. What devil was't
    That thus hath cozen'd you 
at hoodman-blind?
    Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
    Ears without hands or eyes,
 smelling sans all,
    Or but a sickly part of one true sense
    Could not so mope.
    O shame
! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
    If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
    To flamin
g youth let virtue be as wax
    And melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame
    When the compulsi
ve ardour gives the charge,
    Since frost itself as actively doth burn,
    And reason panders w
ill.
  Queen. O Hamlet, speak no more!
    Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul,
    And ther
e I see such black and grained spots
    As will not leave their tinct.
  Ham. Nay, but to live
 
   In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
    Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love
    Ov
er the nasty sty!
  Queen. O, speak to me no more!
    These words like daggers enter in mine ears
.
    No more, sweet Hamlet!
  Ham. A murtherer and a villain!
    A slave that is not twentieth 
part the tithe
    Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
    A cutpurse of the empire and the r
ule,
    That from a shelf the precious diadem stole
    And put it in his pocket!
  Queen. No mo
re!

                Enter the Ghost in his nightgown.

  Ham. A king of shreds and patches!-
 
   Save me and hover o'er me with your wings,
    You heavenly guards! What would your gracious fig
ure?
  Queen. Alas, he's mad!
  Ham. Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
    That, laps'd in
 time and passion, lets go by
    Th' important acting of your dread command?
    O, say!
  Ghost
. Do not forget. This visitation
    Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
    But look, amaz
ement on thy mother sits.
    O, step between her and her fighting soul
    Conceit in weakest bod
ies strongest works.
    Speak to her, Hamlet.
  Ham. How is it with you, lady?
  Queen. Alas, ho
w is't with you,
    That you do bend your eye on vacancy,
    And with th' encorporal air do hold
 discourse?
    Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
    And, as the sleeping soldiers in 
th' alarm,
    Your bedded hairs, like life in excrements,
    Start up and stand an end. O gentle
 son,
    Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
    Sprinkle cool patience! Whereon do you look
?
  Ham. On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!
    His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching 
to stones,
    Would make them capable.- Do not look upon me,
    Lest with this piteous action yo
u convert
    My stern effects. Then what I have to do
    Will want true colour- tears perchance 
for blood.
  Queen. To whom do you speak this?
  Ham. Do you see nothing there?
  Queen. Nothing 
at all; yet all that is I see.
  Ham. Nor did you nothing hear?
  Queen. No, nothing but ourselves
.
  Ham. Why, look you there! Look how it steals away!
    My father, in his habit as he liv'd!
 
   Look where he goes even now out at the portal!
                                                 
    Exit Ghost.
  Queen. This is the very coinage of your brain.
    This bodiless creation ecstas
y
    Is very cunning in.
  Ham. Ecstasy?
    My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time
    A
nd makes as healthful music. It is not madness
    That I have utt'red. Bring me to the test,
    
And I the matter will reword; which madness
    Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
    
Lay not that flattering unction to your soul
    That not your trespass but my madness speaks.
   
 It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
    Whiles rank corruption, mining all within,
    
Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
    Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
    And
 do not spread the compost on the weeds
    To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;
    Fo
r in the fatness of these pursy times
    Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg-
    Yea, curb and
 woo for leave to do him good.
  Queen. O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
  Ham. O, thr
ow away the worser part of it,
    And live the purer with the other half,
    Good night- but go 
not to my uncle's bed.
    Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
    That monster, custom, who all 
sense doth eat
    Of habits evil, is angel yet in this,
    That to the use of actions fair and g
ood
    He likewise gives a frock or livery,
    That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,
    And 
that shall lend a kind of easiness
    To the next abstinence; the next more easy;
    For use alm
ost can change the stamp of nature,
    And either [master] the devil, or throw him out
    With w
ondrous potency. Once more, good night;
    And when you are desirous to be blest,
    I'll blessi
ng beg of you.- For this same lord,
    I do repent; but heaven hath pleas'd it so,
    To punish 
me with this, and this with me,
    That I must be their scourge and minister.
    I will bestow h
im, and will answer well
    The death I gave him. So again, good night.
    I must be cruel, only
 to be kind;
    Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.
    One word more, good lady.
  Queen
. What shall I do?
  Ham. Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
    Let the bloat King tempt y
ou again to bed;
    Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
    And let him, for a pair o
f reechy kisses,
    Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,
    Make you to ravel all t
his matter out,
    That I essentially am not in madness,
    But mad in craft. 'Twere good you le
t him know;
    For who that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
    Would from a paddock, from a ba
t, a gib
    Such dear concernings hide? Who would do so?
    No, in despite of sense and secrecy,

    Unpeg the basket on the house's top,
    Let the birds fly, and like the famous ape,
    To 
try conclusions, in the basket creep
    And break your own neck down.
  Queen. Be thou assur'd, i
f words be made of breath,
    And breath of life, I have no life to breathe
    What thou hast sa
id to me.
  Ham. I must to England; you know that?
  Queen. Alack,
    I had forgot! 'Tis so conc
luded on.
  Ham. There's letters seal'd; and my two schoolfellows,
    Whom I will trust as I will
 adders fang'd,
    They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way
    And marshal me to knavery. L
et it work;
    For 'tis the sport to have the enginer
    Hoist with his own petar; and 't shall 
go hard
    But I will delve one yard below their mines
    And blow them at the moon. O, 'tis mos
t sweet
    When in one line two crafts directly meet.
    This man shall set me packing.
    I'l
l lug the guts into the neighbour room.-
    Mother, good night.- Indeed, this counsellor
    Is n
ow most still, most secret, and most grave,
    Who was in life a foolish peating knave.
    Come,
 sir, to draw toward an end with you.
    Good night, mother.
                  [Exit the Queen. T
hen] Exit Hamlet, tugging in
                                                       Polonius.

ACT IV. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King and Queen, with Rose
ncrantz and Guildenstern.

  King. There's matter in these sighs. These profound heaves
    You m
ust translate; 'tis fit we understand them.
    Where is your son?
  Queen. Bestow this place on u
s a little while.
                          [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
    Ah, mine ow
n lord, what have I seen to-night!
  King. What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
  Queen. Mad as the se
a and wind when both contend
    Which is the mightier. In his lawless fit
    Behind the arras he
aring something stir,
    Whips out his rapier, cries 'A rat, a rat!'
    And in this brainish app
rehension kills
    The unseen good old man.
  King. O heavy deed!
    It had been so with us, ha
d we been there.
    His liberty is full of threats to all-
    To you yourself, to us, to every o
ne.
    Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
    It will be laid to us, whose providence

    Should have kept short, restrain'd, and out of haunt
    This mad young man. But so much was o
ur love
    We would not understand what was most fit,
    But, like the owner of a foul disease,

    To keep it from divulging, let it feed
    Even on the pith of life. Where is he gone?
  Quee
n. To draw apart the body he hath kill'd;
    O'er whom his very madness, like some ore
    Among 
a mineral of metals base,
    Shows itself pure. He weeps for what is done.
  King. O Gertrude, co
me away!
    The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch
    But we will ship him hence; and this 
vile deed
    We must with all our majesty and skill
    Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildens
tern!

             Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

    Friends both, go join you with some
 further aid.
    Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
    And from his mother's closet hath he 
dragg'd him.
    Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body
    Into the chapel. I pray you h
aste in this.
                          Exeunt [Rosencrantz and Guildenstern].
    Come, Gertrude,
 we'll call up our wisest friends
    And let them know both what we mean to do
    And what's unt
imely done. [So haply slander-]
    Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter,
    As level as the c
annon to his blank,
    Transports his poisoned shot- may miss our name
    And hit the woundless 
air.- O, come away!
    My soul is full of discord and dismay.
                                   
                      Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A passage in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet
.

  Ham. Safely stow'd.
  Gentlemen. (within) Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!
  Ham. But soft! What noise?
 Who calls on Hamlet? O, here they
come.

               Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

 
 Ros. What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
  Ham. Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis
 kin.
  Ros. Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
    And bear it to the chapel.
  Ham.
 Do not believe it.
  Ros. Believe what?
  Ham. That I can keep your counsel, and not mine own. Be
sides,
to be
    demanded of a sponge, what replication should be made by the
son
    of a king?

  Ros. Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
  Ham. Ay, sir; that soaks up the King's countenance, h
is
rewards,
    his authorities. But such officers do the King best service
in
    the end. He k
eeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his
jaw;
    first mouth'd, to be last swallowed. When he
 needs what you
have
    glean'd, it is but squeezing you and, sponge, you shall be
dry
    agai
n.
  Ros. I understand you not, my lord.
  Ham. I am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a fool
ish ear.
  Ros. My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us
to
    the King.
  Ha
m. The body is with the King, but the King is not with the
body.
    The King is a thing-
  Guil.
 A thing, my lord?
  Ham. Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.
                  
                                       Exeunt.




Scene III.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.


Enter King.

  King. I have sent to seek him and to find the body.
    How dangerous is it tha
t this man goes loose!
    Yet must not we put the strong law on him.
    He's lov'd of the distra
cted multitude,
    Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;
    And where 'tis so, th' off
ender's scourge is weigh'd,
    But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,
    This sudde
n sending him away must seem
    Deliberate pause. Diseases desperate grown
    By desperate appli
ance are reliev'd,
    Or not at all.

                    Enter Rosencrantz.

    How now O Wh
at hath befall'n?
  Ros. Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
    We cannot get from him.
  
King. But where is he?
  Ros. Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
  King. Bring him 
before us.
  Ros. Ho, Guildenstern! Bring in my lord.

        Enter Hamlet and Guildenstern [wit
h Attendants].

  King. Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
  Ham. At supper.
  King. At supper? Wher
e?
  Ham. Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A certain
    convocation of politic worms are
 e'en at him. Your worm is
your
    only emperor for diet. We fat all creatures else to fat us,
a
nd
    we fat ourselves for maggots. Your fat king and your lean
beggar
    is but variable servi
ce- two dishes, but to one table. That's
the
    end.
  King. Alas, alas!
  Ham. A man may fish 
with the worm that hath eat of a king, and
eat
    of the fish that hath fed of that worm.
  King
. What dost thou mean by this?
  Ham. Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress
through

    the guts of a beggar.
  King. Where is Polonius?
  Ham. In heaven. Send thither to see. If y
our messenger find him
not
    there, seek him i' th' other place yourself. But indeed, if
you
 
   find him not within this month, you shall nose him as you go
up
    the stair, into the lobby.

  King. Go seek him there. [To Attendants.]
  Ham. He will stay till you come.
                  
                          [Exeunt Attendants.]
  King. Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety
,-
    Which we do tender as we dearly grieve
    For that which thou hast done,- must send thee h
ence
    With fiery quickness. Therefore prepare thyself.
    The bark is ready and the wind at he
lp,
    Th' associates tend, and everything is bent
    For England.
  Ham. For England?
  King.
 Ay, Hamlet.
  Ham. Good.
  King. So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
  Ham. I see a cherub t
hat sees them. But come, for England!
    Farewell, dear mother.
  King. Thy loving father, Hamlet
.
  Ham. My mother! Father and mother is man and wife; man and wife
is
    one flesh; and so, my 
mother. Come, for England!
Exit.
  King. Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard.
    Del
ay it not; I'll have him hence to-night.
    Away! for everything is seal'd and done
    That else
 leans on th' affair. Pray you make haste.
                            Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guild
enstern]
    And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught,-
    As my great power thereof may gi
ve thee sense,
    Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
    After the Danish sword, and thy f
ree awe
    Pays homage to us,- thou mayst not coldly set
    Our sovereign process, which imports
 at full,
    By letters congruing to that effect,
    The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England
;
    For like the hectic in my blood he rages,
    And thou must cure me. Till I know 'tis done,

    Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.             Exit.

Scene IV.
Ne
ar Elsinore.

Enter Fortinbras with his Army over the stage.

  For. Go, Captain, from me greet 
the Danish king.
    Tell him that by his license Fortinbras
    Craves the conveyance of a promis
'd march
    Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.
    If that his Majesty would aught with u
s,
    We shall express our duty in his eye;
    And let him know so.
  Capt. I will do't, my lor
d.
  For. Go softly on.
                                   Exeunt [all but the Captain].

      
 Enter Hamlet, Rosencrantz, [Guildenstern,] and others.

  Ham. Good sir, whose powers are these?

  Capt. They are of Norway, sir.
  Ham. How purpos'd, sir, I pray you?
  Capt. Against some part 
of Poland.
  Ham. Who commands them, sir?
  Capt. The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.
  Ham. Go
es it against the main of Poland, sir,
    Or for some frontier?
  Capt. Truly to speak, and with 
no addition,
    We go to gain a little patch of ground
    That hath in it no profit but the name
.
    To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
    Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole

    A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
  Ham. Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
  C
apt. Yes, it is already garrison'd.
  Ham. Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
    Will 
not debate the question of this straw.
    This is th' imposthume of much wealth and peace,
    Th
at inward breaks, and shows no cause without
    Why the man dies.- I humbly thank you, sir.
  Cap
t. God b' wi' you, sir.                             [Exit.]
  Ros. Will't please you go, my lord?

  Ham. I'll be with you straight. Go a little before.
                                        [Exeu
nt all but Hamlet.]
    How all occasions do inform against me
    And spur my dull revenge! What 
is a man,
    If his chief good and market of his time
    Be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no m
ore.
    Sure he that made us with such large discourse,
    Looking before and after, gave us not

    That capability and godlike reason
    To fust in us unus'd. Now, whether it be
    Bestial 
oblivion, or some craven scruple
    Of thinking too precisely on th' event,-
    A thought which,
 quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
    And ever three parts coward,- I do not know
    Why yet I
 live to say 'This thing's to do,'
    Sith I have cause, and will, and strength, and means
    To
 do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me.
    Witness this army of such mass and charge,
    Led b
y a delicate and tender prince,
    Whose spirit, with divine ambition puff'd,
    Makes mouths at
 the invisible event,
    Exposing what is mortal and unsure
    To all that fortune, death, and d
anger dare,
    Even for an eggshell. Rightly to be great
    Is not to stir without great argumen
t,
    But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
    When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,
 
   That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,
    Excitements of my reason and my blood,
    And
 let all sleep, while to my shame I see
    The imminent death of twenty thousand men
    That for
 a fantasy and trick of fame
    Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot
    Whereon the nu
mbers cannot try the cause,
    Which is not tomb enough and continent
    To hide the slain? O, f
rom this time forth,
    My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!            Exit.

Scene V.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter Horatio, Queen, and a Gentleman.

  Que
en. I will not speak with her.
  Gent. She is importunate, indeed distract.
    Her mood will need
s be pitied.
  Queen. What would she have?
  Gent. She speaks much of her father; says she hears

    There's tricks i' th' world, and hems, and beats her heart;
    Spurns enviously at straws; spe
aks things in doubt,
    That carry but half sense. Her speech is nothing,
    Yet the unshaped us
e of it doth move
    The hearers to collection; they aim at it,
    And botch the words up fit to
 their own thoughts;
    Which, as her winks and nods and gestures yield them,
    Indeed would ma
ke one think there might be thought,
    Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
  Hor. 'Twere go
od she were spoken with; for she may strew
    Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.
  Quee
n. Let her come in.
                                               [Exit Gentleman.]
    [Aside] T
o my sick soul (as sin's true nature is)
    Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
    So f
ull of artless jealousy is guilt
    It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.

                 E
nter Ophelia distracted.

  Oph. Where is the beauteous Majesty of Denmark?
  Queen. How now, Oph
elia?
  Oph. (sings)
         How should I your true-love know
           From another one?
    
     By his cockle bat and' staff
           And his sandal shoon.

  Queen. Alas, sweet lady, wh
at imports this song?
  Oph. Say you? Nay, pray You mark.

    (Sings) He is dead and gone, lady,

              He is dead and gone;
            At his head a grass-green turf,
              At 
his heels a stone.

    O, ho!
  Queen. Nay, but Ophelia-
  Oph. Pray you mark.

    (Sings) W
hite his shroud as the mountain snow-

                    Enter King.

  Queen. Alas, look here
, my lord!
  Oph. (Sings)
           Larded all with sweet flowers;
         Which bewept to the 
grave did not go
           With true-love showers.

  King. How do you, pretty lady?
  Oph. Wel
l, God dild you! They say the owl was a baker's
daughter.
    Lord, we know what we are, but know 
not what we may be. God
be at
    your table!
  King. Conceit upon her father.
  Oph. Pray let's
 have no words of this; but when they ask, you
what
    it means, say you this:

    (Sings) To-
morrow is Saint Valentine's day,
              All in the morning bedtime,
            And I a mai
d at your window,
              To be your Valentine.

            Then up he rose and donn'd his
 clo'es
              And dupp'd the chamber door,
            Let in the maid, that out a maid
 
             Never departed more.

  King. Pretty Ophelia!
  Oph. Indeed, la, without an oath, I'
ll make an end on't!

    [Sings] By Gis and by Saint Charity,
              Alack, and fie for s
hame!
            Young men will do't if they come to't
              By Cock, they are to blame.


            Quoth she, 'Before you tumbled me,
              You promis'd me to wed.'

    He 
answers:

            'So would I 'a' done, by yonder sun,
              An thou hadst not come t
o my bed.'

  King. How long hath she been thus?
  Oph. I hope all will be well. We must be patie
nt; but I cannot
    choose but weep to think they would lay him i' th' cold
ground.
    My broth
er shall know of it; and so I thank you for your good
    counsel. Come, my coach! Good night, ladi
es. Good night,
sweet
    ladies. Good night, good night.                         Exit
  King. Fo
llow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.
                                                 [
Exit Horatio.]

    O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs
    All from her father's dea
th. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
    When sorrows come, they come not single spies.
    But in battalions
! First, her father slain;
    Next, your son gone, and he most violent author
    Of his own just
 remove; the people muddied,
    Thick and and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers
    For 
good Polonius' death, and we have done but greenly
    In hugger-mugger to inter him; poor Ophelia

    Divided from herself and her fair judgment,
    Without the which we are pictures or mere beas
ts;
    Last, and as much containing as all these,
    Her brother is in secret come from France;

    And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
    Feeds on his wonder, keep, himself in clouds,
   
 With pestilent speeches of his father's death,
    Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
    Wil
l nothing stick our person to arraign
    In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
    Like to a 
murd'ring piece, in many places
    Give me superfluous death.                  A noise within.
  
Queen. Alack, what noise is this?
  King. Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.

      
               Enter a Messenger.

    What is the matter?
  Mess. Save Yourself, my lord:
    T
he ocean, overpeering of his list,
    Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
    Than Young
 Laertes, in a riotous head,
    O'erbears Your offices. The rabble call him lord;
    And, as the
 world were now but to begin,
    Antiquity forgot, custom not known,
    The ratifiers and props 
of every word,
    They cry 'Choose we! Laertes shall be king!'
    Caps, hands, and tongues appla
ud it to the clouds,
    'Laertes shall be king! Laertes king!'
                                  
               A noise within.
  Queen. How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!
    O, this is
 counter, you false Danish dogs!
  King. The doors are broke.

                    Enter Laertes 
with others.

  Laer. Where is this king?- Sirs, staid you all without.
  All. No, let's come in!

  Laer. I pray you give me leave.
  All. We will, we will!
  Laer. I thank you. Keep the door.  
    [Exeunt his Followers.]
    O thou vile king,
    Give me my father!
  Queen. Calmly, good La
ertes.
  Laer. That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard;
    Cries cuckold to my father
; brands the harlot
    Even here between the chaste unsmirched brows
    Of my true mother.
  Ki
ng. What is the cause, Laertes,
    That thy rebellion looks so giantlike?
    Let him go, Gertrud
e. Do not fear our person.
    There's such divinity doth hedge a king
    That treason can but pe
ep to what it would,
    Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,
    Why thou art thus incens'd
. Let him go, Gertrude.
    Speak, man.
  Laer. Where is my father?
  King. Dead.
  Queen. But n
ot by him!
  King. Let him demand his fill.
  Laer. How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
 
   To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil
    Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pi
t!
    I dare damnation. To this point I stand,
    That both the world, I give to negligence,
  
  Let come what comes; only I'll be reveng'd
    Most throughly for my father.
  King. Who shall s
tay you?
  Laer. My will, not all the world!
    And for my means, I'll husband them so well
    
They shall go far with little.
  King. Good Laertes,
    If you desire to know the certainty
    
Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge
    That sweepstake you will draw both frien
d and foe,
    Winner and loser?
  Laer. None but his enemies.
  King. Will you know them then?

  Laer. To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms
    And, like the kind life-rend'ring pelica
n,
    Repast them with my blood.
  King. Why, now You speak
    Like a good child and a true gen
tleman.
    That I am guiltless of your father's death,
    And am most sensibly in grief for it,

    It shall as level to your judgment pierce
    As day does to your eye.
                      
        A noise within: 'Let her come in.'
  Laer. How now? What noise is that?

                
      Enter Ophelia.

    O heat, dry up my brains! Tears seven times salt
    Burn out the sense
 and virtue of mine eye!
    By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight
    Till our scale tur
n the beam. O rose of May!
    Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
    O heavens! is't possible
 a young maid's wits
    Should be as mortal as an old man's life?
    Nature is fine in love, and
 where 'tis fine,
    It sends some precious instance of itself
    After the thing it loves.

 
 Oph. (sings)
         They bore him barefac'd on the bier
           (Hey non nony, nony, hey non
y)
         And in his grave rain'd many a tear.

    Fare you well, my dove!
  Laer. Hadst thou
 thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
    It could not move thus.
  Oph. You must sing 'A-down a-
down, and you call him a-down-a.'
O,
    how the wheel becomes it! It is the false steward, that s
tole
his
    master's daughter.
  Laer. This nothing's more than matter.
  Oph. There's rosemary
, that's for remembrance. Pray you, love,
    remember. And there is pansies, that's for thoughts.

  Laer. A document in madness! Thoughts and remembrance fitted.
  Oph. There's fennel for you, and
 columbines. There's rue for
you,
    and here's some for me. We may call it herb of grace o'
Sun
days.
    O, you must wear your rue with a difference! There's a daisy.
I
    would give you some
 violets, but they wither'd all when my
father
    died. They say he made a good end.

    [Sing
s] For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.

  Laer. Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,
  
  She turns to favour and to prettiness.
  Oph. (sings)
         And will he not come again?
    
     And will he not come again?
           No, no, he is dead;
           Go to thy deathbed;
  
       He never will come again.

         His beard was as white as snow,
         All flaxen wa
s his poll.
           He is gone, he is gone,
           And we cast away moan.
         God 'a'
mercy on his soul!

    And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God b' wi' you.
Exit.
  Laer. Do
 you see this, O God?
  King. Laertes, I must commune with your grief,
    Or you deny me right. G
o but apart,
    Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will,
    And they shall hear and jud
ge 'twixt you and me.
    If by direct or by collateral hand
    They find us touch'd, we will our
 kingdom give,
    Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours,
    To you in satisfaction; but
 if not,
    Be you content to lend your patience to us,
    And we shall jointly labour with your
 soul
    To give it due content.
  Laer. Let this be so.
    His means of death, his obscure fun
eral-
    No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,
    No noble rite nor formal ostentation
,-
    Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
    That I must call't in question.
  Kin
g. So you shall;
    And where th' offence is let the great axe fall.
    I pray you go with me.

                                                          Exeunt

Scene VI.
Els
inore. Another room in the Castle.

Enter Horatio with an Attendant.

  Hor. What are they that 
would speak with me?
  Servant. Seafaring men, sir. They say they have letters for
you.
  Hor. Le
t them come in.
                                               [Exit Attendant.]
    I do not know
 from what part of the world
    I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.

                 
         Enter Sailors.

  Sailor. God bless you, sir.
  Hor. Let him bless thee too.
  Sailor. 
'A shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter for
you,
    sir,- it comes from th' ambassador t
hat was bound for
England- if
    your name be Horatio, as I am let to know it is.
  Hor. (reads 
the letter) 'Horatio, when thou shalt have
overlook'd
    this, give these fellows some means to t
he King. They have
    letters for him. Ere we were two days old at sea, a pirate of

    very wa
rlike appointment gave us chase. Finding ourselves too
    slow of sail, we put on a compelled valo
ur, and in the
grapple I
    boarded them. On the instant they got clear of our ship; so I
    al
one became their prisoner. They have dealt with me like
thieves
    of mercy; but they knew what t
hey did: I am to do a good turn
for
    them. Let the King have the letters I have sent, and repai
r
thou
    to me with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death. I have
words
    to speak in thin
e ear will make thee dumb; yet are they much
too
    light for the bore of the matter. These good 
fellows will
bring
    thee where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their
course
    for E
ngland. Of them I have much to tell thee. Farewell.
                            'He that thou knowe
st thine, HAMLET.'

    Come, I will give you way for these your letters,
    And do't the speedi

    To him from whom you brought them.                   Exeunt.

Scene VII.
Elsinore. Another room in the Castle.

Enter King and Laertes.

  King.
 Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
    And You must put me in your heart for friend,
 
   Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
    That he which hath your noble father slain
   
 Pursued my life.
  Laer. It well appears. But tell me
    Why you proceeded not against these fea
ts
    So crimeful and so capital in nature,
    As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
    
You mainly were stirr'd up.
  King. O, for two special reasons,
    Which may to you, perhaps, see
m much unsinew'd,
    But yet to me they are strong. The Queen his mother
    Lives almost by his 
looks; and for myself,-
    My virtue or my plague, be it either which,-
    She's so conjunctive 
to my life and soul
    That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
    I could not but by her.
 The other motive
    Why to a public count I might not go
    Is the great love the general gende
r bear him,
    Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
    Would, like the spring that tu
rneth wood to stone,
    Convert his gives to graces; so that my arrows,
    Too slightly timber'd
 for so loud a wind,
    Would have reverted to my bow again,
    And not where I had aim'd them.

  Laer. And so have I a noble father lost;
    A sister driven into desp'rate terms,
    Whose wo
rth, if praises may go back again,
    Stood challenger on mount of all the age
    For her perfec
tions. But my revenge will come.
  King. Break not your sleeps for that. You must not think
    Th
at we are made of stuff so flat and dull
    That we can let our beard be shook with danger,
    A
nd think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more.
    I lov'd your father, and we love ourself,
  
  And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine-

                 Enter a Messenger with letters.


    How now? What news?
  Mess. Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:
    This to your Majesty; this to
 the Queen.
  King. From Hamlet? Who brought them?
  Mess. Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them 
not.
    They were given me by Claudio; he receiv'd them
    Of him that brought them.
  King. La
ertes, you shall hear them.
    Leave us.
                                                 Exit Me
ssenger.
    [Reads]'High and Mighty,-You shall know I am set naked on
your
    kingdom. To-morro
w shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes;
    when I shall (first asking your pardon thereunto) 
recount the
    occasion of my sudden and more strange return.
                                   
                  'HAMLET.'
    What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?
    Or is it so
me abuse, and no such thing?
  Laer. Know you the hand?
  King. 'Tis Hamlet's character. 'Naked!'

    And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'
    Can you advise me?
  Laer. I am lost in it, my
 lord. But let him come!
    It warms the very sickness in my heart
    That I shall live and tell
 him to his teeth,
    'Thus didest thou.'
  King. If it be so, Laertes
    (As how should it be 
so? how otherwise?),
    Will you be rul'd by me?
  Laer. Ay my lord,
    So you will not o'errul
e me to a peace.
  King. To thine own peace. If he be now return'd
    As checking at his voyage, 
and that he means
    No more to undertake it, I will work him
    To exploit now ripe in my devic
e,
    Under the which he shall not choose but fall;
    And for his death no wind shall breathe

    But even his mother shall uncharge the practice
    And call it accident.
  Laer. My lord, I w
ill be rul'd;
    The rather, if you could devise it so
    That I might be the organ.
  King. It
 falls right.
    You have been talk'd of since your travel much,
    And that in Hamlet's hearing
, for a quality
    Wherein they say you shine, Your sum of parts
    Did not together pluck such 
envy from him
    As did that one; and that, in my regard,
    Of the unworthiest siege.
  Laer. 
What part is that, my lord?
  King. A very riband in the cap of youth-
    Yet needfull too; for y
outh no less becomes
    The light and careless livery that it wears
    Than settled age his sabl
es and his weeds,
    Importing health and graveness. Two months since
    Here was a gentleman of
 Normandy.
    I have seen myself, and serv'd against, the French,
    And they can well on horseb
ack; but this gallant
    Had witchcraft in't. He grew unto his seat,
    And to such wondrous doi
ng brought his horse
    As had he been incorps'd and demi-natur'd
    With the brave beast. So fa
r he topp'd my thought
    That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
    Come short of what he did.

  Laer. A Norman was't?
  King. A Norman.
  Laer. Upon my life, Lamound.
  King. The very same.

  Laer. I know him well. He is the broach indeed
    And gem of all the nation.
  King. He made 
confession of you;
    And gave you such a masterly report
    For art and exercise in your defenc
e,
    And for your rapier most especially,
    That he cried out 'twould be a sight indeed
    I
f one could match you. The scrimers of their nation
    He swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye
,
    If you oppos'd them. Sir, this report of his
    Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
    Th
at he could nothing do but wish and beg
    Your sudden coming o'er to play with you.
    Now, out
 of this-
  Laer. What out of this, my lord?
  King. Laertes, was your father dear to you?
    Or
 are you like the painting of a sorrow,
    A face without a heart,'
  Laer. Why ask you this?
  
King. Not that I think you did not love your father;
    But that I know love is begun by time,
  
  And that I see, in passages of proof,
    Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
    There liv
es within the very flame of love
    A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
    And nothing i
s at a like goodness still;
    For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
    Dies in his own too-much. 
That we would do,
    We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes,
    And hath abatement
s and delays as many
    As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
    And then this 'should
' is like a spendthrift sigh,
    That hurts by easing. But to the quick o' th' ulcer!
    Hamlet 
comes back. What would you undertake
    To show yourself your father's son in deed
    More than 
in words?
  Laer. To cut his throat i' th' church!
  King. No place indeed should murther sanctuar
ize;
    Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,
    Will you do this? Keep close within
 your chamber.
    Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home.
    We'll put on those shall prai
se your excellence
    And set a double varnish on the fame
    The Frenchman gave you; bring you 
in fine together
    And wager on your heads. He, being remiss,
    Most generous, and free from a
ll contriving,
    Will not peruse the foils; so that with ease,
    Or with a little shuffling, y
ou may choose
    A sword unbated, and, in a pass of practice,
    Requite him for your father.
 
 Laer. I will do't!
    And for that purpose I'll anoint my sword.
    I bought an unction of a mo
untebank,
    So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
    Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare
,
    Collected from all simples that have virtue
    Under the moon, can save the thing from deat
h
    This is but scratch'd withal. I'll touch my point
    With this contagion, that, if I gall h
im slightly,
    It may be death.
  King. Let's further think of this,
    Weigh what convenience
 both of time and means
    May fit us to our shape. If this should fall,
    And that our drift l
ook through our bad performance.
    'Twere better not assay'd. Therefore this project
    Should 
have a back or second, that might hold
    If this did blast in proof. Soft! let me see.
    We'll
 make a solemn wager on your cunnings-
    I ha't!
    When in your motion you are hot and dry-
 
   As make your bouts more violent to that end-
    And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepar'd
 him
    A chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,
    If he by chance escape your venom'd stu
ck,
    Our purpose may hold there.- But stay, what noise,

                           Enter Quee
n.

    How now, sweet queen?
  Queen. One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
    So fast they 
follow. Your sister's drown'd, Laertes.
  Laer. Drown'd! O, where?
  Queen. There is a willow grow
s aslant a brook,
    That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream.
    There with fantastic ga
rlands did she come
    Of crowflowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,
    That liberal sheph
erds give a grosser name,
    But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them.
    There on the
 pendant boughs her coronet weeds
    Clamb'ring to hang, an envious sliver broke,
    When down h
er weedy trophies and herself
    Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide
    And, merm
aid-like, awhile they bore her up;
    Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes,
    As one i
ncapable of her own distress,
    Or like a creature native and indued
    Unto that element; but 
long it could not be
    Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
    Pull'd the poor wretc
h from her melodious lay
    To muddy death.
  Laer. Alas, then she is drown'd?
  Queen. Drown'd,
 drown'd.
  Laer. Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
    And therefore I forbid my tears; 
but yet
    It is our trick; nature her custom holds,
    Let shame say what it will. When these a
re gone,
    The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord.
    I have a speech of fire, that fain would b
laze
    But that this folly douts it.                          Exit.
  King. Let's follow, Gertru
de.
    How much I had to do to calm his rage I
    Now fear I this will give it start again;
   
 Therefore let's follow.
                                                         Exeunt.

ACT V. Scene I.
Elsinore. A churchyard.

Enter two Clowns, [with spades and pickaxes]
.

  Clown. Is she to be buried in Christian burial when she
wilfully
    seeks her own salvatio
n?
  Other. I tell thee she is; therefore make her grave straight.
    The crowner hath sate on he
r, and finds it Christian burial.
  Clown. How can that be, unless she drown'd herself in her own

    defence?
  Other. Why, 'tis found so.
  Clown. It must be se offendendo; it cannot be else. Fo
r here
lies
    the point: if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act; and
an
    act hath th
ree branches-it is to act, to do, and to perform;
    argal, she drown'd herself wittingly.
  Othe
r. Nay, but hear you, Goodman Delver!
  Clown. Give me leave. Here lies the water; good. Here stand
s
the
    man; good. If the man go to this water and drown himself, it
is,
    will he nill he, 
he goes- mark you that. But if the water
come to
    him and drown him, he drowns not himself. Arg
al, he that is
not
    guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.
  Other. But is this la
w?
  Clown. Ay, marry, is't- crowner's quest law.
  Other. Will you ha' the truth an't? If this ha
d not been a
    gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o' Christian
burial.
  Clown. Why, 
there thou say'st! And the more pity that great
folk
    should have count'nance in this world to 
drown or hang
themselves
    more than their even-Christian. Come, my spade! There is no
    anci
ent gentlemen but gard'ners, ditchers, and grave-makers.
They
    hold up Adam's profession.
  Ot
her. Was he a gentleman?
  Clown. 'A was the first that ever bore arms.
  Other. Why, he had none.

  Clown. What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the
Scripture?
    The Scripture says Ada
m digg'd. Could he dig without arms?
I'll
    put another question to thee. If thou answerest me n
ot to the
    purpose, confess thyself-
  Other. Go to!
  Clown. What is he that builds stronger 
than either the mason,
the
    shipwright, or the carpenter?
  Other. The gallows-maker; for that
 frame outlives a thousand
    tenants.
  Clown. I like thy wit well, in good faith. The gallows d
oes
well.
    But how does it well? It does well to those that do ill. Now,
    thou dost ill to 
say the gallows is built stronger than the
    church. Argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To't
 again,
come!
  Other. Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a
    carpenter?
  Clo
wn. Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
  Other. Marry, now I can tell!
  Clown. To't.
  Other. Mass, I
 cannot tell.

                 Enter Hamlet and Horatio afar off.

  Clown. Cudgel thy brains n
o more about it, for your dull ass
will
    not mend his pace with beating; and when you are ask'd
 this
    question next, say 'a grave-maker.' The houses he makes lasts
    till doomsday. Go, get
 thee to Yaughan; fetch me a stoup of
    liquor.
                                            [Exi
t Second Clown.]


                       [Clown digs and] sings.

       In youth when I did l
ove, did love,
         Methought it was very sweet;
       To contract- O- the time for- a- my be
hove,
         O, methought there- a- was nothing- a- meet.

  Ham. Has this fellow no feeling of
 his business, that he sings
at
    grave-making?
  Hor. Custom hath made it in him a property of
 easiness.
  Ham. 'Tis e'en so. The hand of little employment hath the
daintier
    sense.
  Clo
wn. (sings)
         But age with his stealing steps
           Hath clawed me in his clutch,
   
      And hath shipped me intil the land,
           As if I had never been such.
                
                            [Throws up a skull.]

  Ham. That skull had a tongue in it, and could 
sing once. How
the
    knave jowls it to the ground,as if 'twere Cain's jawbone,
that
    did th
e first murther! This might be the pate of a
Politician,
    which this ass now o'erreaches; one t
hat would circumvent
God,
    might it not?
  Hor. It might, my lord.
  Ham. Or of a courtier, w
hich could say 'Good morrow, sweet
lord!
    How dost thou, good lord?' This might be my Lord Such
-a-one,
that
    prais'd my Lord Such-a-one's horse when he meant to beg it-
might
    it not?

  Hor. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Why, e'en so! and now my Lady Worm's, chapless, and
knock'd
    about 
the mazzard with a sexton's spade. Here's fine
revolution,
    and we had the trick to see't. Did 
these bones cost no more
the
    breeding but to play at loggets with 'em? Mine ache to think
   
 on't.
  Clown. (Sings)
         A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,
           For and a shrouding s
heet;
         O, a Pit of clay for to be made
           For such a guest is meet.
             
                         Throws up [another skull].

  Ham. There's another. Why may not that be t
he skull of a
lawyer?
    Where be his quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, his
tenures,
    a
nd his tricks? Why does he suffer this rude knave now to
knock
    him about the sconce with a dir
ty shovel, and will not tell
him
    of his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be in's time

a
    great buyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizances,
his
    fines, his double vouc
hers, his recoveries. Is this the fine
of
    his fines, and the recovery of his recoveries, to ha
ve his
fine
    pate full of fine dirt? Will his vouchers vouch him no more
of
    his purchases
, and double ones too, than the length and
breadth
    of a pair of indentures? The very conveyanc
es of his lands
will
    scarcely lie in this box; and must th' inheritor himself have
no
    mo
re, ha?
  Hor. Not a jot more, my lord.
  Ham. Is not parchment made of sheepskins?
  Hor. Ay, my
 lord, And of calveskins too.
  Ham. They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in
that. I

    will speak to this fellow. Whose grave's this, sirrah?
  Clown. Mine, sir.

    [Sings] O, 
a pit of clay for to be made
              For such a guest is meet.

  Ham. I think it be thine 
indeed, for thou liest in't.
  Clown. You lie out on't, sir, and therefore 'tis not yours.
    For
 my part, I do not lie in't, yet it is mine.
  Ham. Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is th
ine. 'Tis
for
    the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.
  Clown. 'Tis a quick lie, s
ir; 'twill away again from me to you.
  Ham. What man dost thou dig it for?
  Clown. For no man, s
ir.
  Ham. What woman then?
  Clown. For none neither.
  Ham. Who is to be buried in't?
  Clown.
 One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's
dead.
  Ham. How absolute the knave is! We m
ust speak by the card, or
    equivocation will undo us. By the Lord, Horatio, this three
years
 
   I have taken note of it, the age is grown so picked that the
toe
    of the peasant comes so ne
ar the heel of the courtier he
galls
    his kibe.- How long hast thou been a grave-maker?
  Clow
n. Of all the days i' th' year, I came to't that day that
our
    last king Hamlet overcame Fortin
bras.
  Ham. How long is that since?
  Clown. Cannot you tell that? Every fool can tell that. It w
as
the
    very day that young Hamlet was born- he that is mad, and sent
    into England.
  Ham
. Ay, marry, why was be sent into England?
  Clown. Why, because 'a was mad. 'A shall recover his w
its
there;
    or, if 'a do not, 'tis no great matter there.
  Ham. Why?
  Clown. 'Twill not he 
seen in him there. There the men are as
mad as
    he.
  Ham. How came he mad?
  Clown. Very str
angely, they say.
  Ham. How strangely?
  Clown. Faith, e'en with losing his wits.
  Ham. Upon wh
at ground?
  Clown. Why, here in Denmark. I have been sexton here, man and
boy
    thirty years.

  Ham. How long will a man lie i' th' earth ere he rot?
  Clown. Faith, if 'a be not rotten before
 'a die (as we have
many
    pocky corses now-a-days that will scarce hold the laying in,
I
    
will last you some eight year or nine year. A tanner will
last
    you nine year.
  Ham. Why he m
ore than another?
  Clown. Why, sir, his hide is so tann'd with his trade that 'a
will
    keep o
ut water a great while; and your water is a sore
decayer of
    your whoreson dead body. Here's a 
skull now. This skull hath
lien
    you i' th' earth three-and-twenty years.
  Ham. Whose was it?

  Clown. A whoreson, mad fellow's it was. Whose do you think it
was?
  Ham. Nay, I know not.
  
Clown. A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! 'A pour'd a flagon
of
    Rhenish on my head once. Thi
s same skull, sir, was Yorick's
    skull, the King's jester.
  Ham. This?
  Clown. E'en that.
 
 Ham. Let me see. [Takes the skull.] Alas, poor Yorick! I knew
him,
    Horatio. A fellow of infin
ite jest, of most excellent fancy.
He
    hath borne me on his back a thousand times. And now how

abhorred
    in my imagination it is! My gorge rises at it. Here hung
those
    lips that I have
 kiss'd I know not how oft. Where be your
gibes
    now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of
 merriment that
    were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock
your
    own grinn
ing? Quite chap- fall'n? Now get you to my lady's
    chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch 
thick, to this
    favour she must come. Make her laugh at that. Prithee,
Horatio,
    tell me on
e thing.
  Hor. What's that, my lord?
  Ham. Dost thou think Alexander look'd o' this fashion i' t
h'
earth?
  Hor. E'en so.
  Ham. And smelt so? Pah!
                                          [P
uts down the skull.]
  Hor. E'en so, my lord.
  Ham. To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why
 may not
    imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it
    stopping a bunghole
?
  Hor. 'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.
  Ham. No, faith, not a jot; but to fol
low him thither with
modesty
    enough, and likelihood to lead it; as thus: Alexander died,
    
Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust
is
    earth; of earth we make loam;
 and why of that loam (whereto
he
    was converted) might they not stop a beer barrel?
    Imper
ious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
    Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.
    O, that tha
t earth which kept the world in awe
    Should patch a wall t' expel the winter's flaw!
    But so
ft! but soft! aside! Here comes the King-

    Enter [priests with] a coffin [in funeral processio
n], King,
             Queen, Laertes, with Lords attendant.]

    The Queen, the courtiers. Who 
is this they follow?
    And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken
    The corse they follow d
id with desp'rate hand
    Fordo it own life. 'Twas of some estate.
    Couch we awhile, and mark.

                                         [Retires with Horatio.]

  Laer. What ceremony else?
 
 Ham. That is Laertes,
    A very noble youth. Mark.
  Laer. What ceremony else?
  Priest. Her ob
sequies have been as far enlarg'd
    As we have warranty. Her death was doubtful;
    And, but th
at great command o'ersways the order,
    She should in ground unsanctified have lodg'd
    Till t
he last trumpet. For charitable prayers,
    Shards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on her.

    Yet here she is allow'd her virgin rites,
    Her maiden strewments, and the bringing home
   
 Of bell and burial.
  Laer. Must there no more be done?
  Priest. No more be done.
    We should
 profane the service of the dead
    To sing a requiem and such rest to her
    As to peace-parted
 souls.
  Laer. Lay her i' th' earth;
    And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
    May violets 
spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,
    A minist'ring angel shall my sister be
    When thou lie
st howling.
  Ham. What, the fair Ophelia?
  Queen. Sweets to the sweet! Farewell.
              
                               [Scatters flowers.]
    I hop'd thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's 
wife;
    I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
    And not have strew'd thy grave.

  Laer. O, treble woe
    Fall ten times treble on that cursed head
    Whose wicked deed thy mos
t ingenious sense
    Depriv'd thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,
    Till I have caught her once
 more in mine arms.
                                             Leaps in the grave.
    Now pile 
your dust upon the quick and dead
    Till of this flat a mountain you have made
    T' o'ertop ol
d Pelion or the skyish head
    Of blue Olympus.
  Ham. [comes forward] What is he whose grief
  
  Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow
    Conjures the wand'ring stars, and makes them s
tand
    Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,
    Hamlet the Dane.                    [Leaps in
 after Laertes.
  Laer. The devil take thy soul!
                                            [Grap
ples with him].
  Ham. Thou pray'st not well.
    I prithee take thy fingers from my throat;
    
For, though I am not splenitive and rash,
    Yet have I in me something dangerous,
    Which let 
thy wisdom fear. Hold off thy hand!
  King. Pluck them asunder.
  Queen. Hamlet, Hamlet!
  All. G
entlemen!
  Hor. Good my lord, be quiet.
             [The Attendants part them, and they come out
 of the
                                                         grave.]
  Ham. Why, I will fight 
with him upon this theme
    Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
  Queen. O my son, what theme?

  Ham. I lov'd Ophelia. Forty thousand brothers
    Could not (with all their quantity of love)
  
  Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?
  King. O, he is mad, Laertes.
  Queen. For love of G
od, forbear him!
  Ham. 'Swounds, show me what thou't do.
    Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast?
 woo't tear thyself?
    Woo't drink up esill? eat a crocodile?
    I'll do't. Dost thou come here
 to whine?
    To outface me with leaping in her grave?
    Be buried quick with her, and so will 
I.
    And if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
    Millions of acres on us, till our ground
,
    Singeing his pate against the burning zone,
    Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth
,
    I'll rant as well as thou.
  Queen. This is mere madness;
    And thus a while the fit will
 work on him.
    Anon, as patient as the female dove
    When that her golden couplets are disclo
s'd,
    His silence will sit drooping.
  Ham. Hear you, sir!
    What is the reason that you use
 me thus?
    I lov'd you ever. But it is no matter.
    Let Hercules himself do what he may,
   
 The cat will mew, and dog will have his day.
Exit.
  King. I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon h
im.
                                                   Exit Horatio.
    [To Laertes] Strengthen y
our patience in our last night's
speech.
    We'll put the matter to the present push.-
    Good 
Gertrude, set some watch over your son.-
    This grave shall have a living monument.
    An hour 
of quiet shortly shall we see;
    Till then in patience our proceeding be.
                      
                                   Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A hall in the Castle.

En
ter Hamlet and Horatio.

  Ham. So much for this, sir; now shall you see the other.
    You do re
member all the circumstance?
  Hor. Remember it, my lord!
  Ham. Sir, in my heart there was a kind
 of fighting
    That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay
    Worse than the mutinies in the b
ilboes. Rashly-
    And prais'd be rashness for it; let us know,
    Our indiscretion sometime ser
ves us well
    When our deep plots do pall; and that should learn us
    There's a divinity that 
shapes our ends,
    Rough-hew them how we will-
  Hor. That is most certain.
  Ham. Up from my c
abin,
    My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
    Grop'd I to find out them; had my desire,

    Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew
    To mine own room again; making so bold
    (M
y fears forgetting manners) to unseal
    Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio
    (O ro
yal knavery!), an exact command,
    Larded with many several sorts of reasons,
    Importing Denm
ark's health, and England's too,
    With, hoo! such bugs and goblins in my life-
    That, on the
 supervise, no leisure bated,
    No, not to stay the finding of the axe,
    My head should be st
ruck off.
  Hor. Is't possible?
  Ham. Here's the commission; read it at more leisure.
    But wi
lt thou bear me how I did proceed?
  Hor. I beseech you.
  Ham. Being thus benetted round with vil
lanies,
    Or I could make a prologue to my brains,
    They had begun the play. I sat me down;

    Devis'd a new commission; wrote it fair.
    I once did hold it, as our statists do,
    A bas
eness to write fair, and labour'd much
    How to forget that learning; but, sir, now
    It did m
e yeoman's service. Wilt thou know
    Th' effect of what I wrote?
  Hor. Ay, good my lord.
  Ham
. An earnest conjuration from the King,
    As England was his faithful tributary,
    As love bet
ween them like the palm might flourish,
    As peace should still her wheaten garland wear
    And
 stand a comma 'tween their amities,
    And many such-like as's of great charge,
    That, on the
 view and knowing of these contents,
    Without debatement further, more or less,
    He should t
he bearers put to sudden death,
    Not shriving time allow'd.
  Hor. How was this seal'd?
  Ham.
 Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
    I had my father's signet in my purse,
    Which was th
e model of that Danish seal;
    Folded the writ up in the form of th' other,
    Subscrib'd it, g
ave't th' impression, plac'd it safely,
    The changeling never known. Now, the next day
    Was 
our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent
    Thou know'st already.
  Hor. So Guildenstern and R
osencrantz go to't.
  Ham. Why, man, they did make love to this employment!
    They are not near 
my conscience; their defeat
    Does by their own insinuation grow.
    'Tis dangerous when the ba
ser nature comes
    Between the pass and fell incensed points
    Of mighty opposites.
  Hor. Wh
y, what a king is this!
  Ham. Does it not, thinks't thee, stand me now upon-
    He that hath kil
l'd my king, and whor'd my mother;
    Popp'd in between th' election and my hopes;
    Thrown out
 his angle for my proper life,
    And with such coz'nage- is't not perfect conscience
    To quit
 him with this arm? And is't not to be damn'd
    To let this canker of our nature come
    In fur
ther evil?
  Hor. It must be shortly known to him from England
    What is the issue of the busine
ss there.
  Ham. It will be short; the interim is mine,
    And a man's life is no more than to sa
y 'one.'
    But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
    That to Laertes I forgot myself,
    For by t
he image of my cause I see
    The portraiture of his. I'll court his favours.
    But sure the br
avery of his grief did put me
    Into a tow'ring passion.
  Hor. Peace! Who comes here?

      
           Enter young Osric, a courtier.

  Osr. Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.

  Ham. I humbly thank you, sir. [Aside to Horatio] Dost know this
    waterfly?
  Hor. [aside to 
Hamlet] No, my good lord.
  Ham. [aside to Horatio] Thy state is the more gracious; for
'tis a
  
  vice to know him. He hath much land, and fertile. Let a beast
be
    lord of beasts, and his cri
b shall stand at the king's mess.
'Tis
    a chough; but, as I say, spacious in the possession of 
dirt.

  Osr. Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should
impart
    a thing to you f
rom his Majesty.
  Ham. I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit. Put
your
    bonnet
 to his right use. 'Tis for the head.
  Osr. I thank your lordship, it is very hot.
  Ham. No, bel
ieve me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly.
  Osr. It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
  
Ham. But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my
complexion.
  Osr. Exceedingly, my lord; it
 is very sultry, as 'twere- I
cannot
    tell how. But, my lord, his Majesty bade me signify to yo
u
that
    he has laid a great wager on your head. Sir, this is the
matter-
  Ham. I beseech you
 remember.
                           [Hamlet moves him to put on his hat.]
  Osr. Nay, good my lo
rd; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here
is
    newly come to court Laertes; believe me, an abs
olute
gentleman,
    full of most excellent differences, of very soft society and
    great showi
ng. Indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the
card
    or calendar of gentry; for you shall fin
d in him the
continent of
    what part a gentleman would see.
  Ham. Sir, his definement suffers
 no perdition in you; though, I

    know, to divide him inventorially would dozy th' arithmetic

of
    memory, and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail.
    But, in the verity of ext
olment, I take him to be a soul of
great
    article, and his infusion of such dearth and rareness
 as, to
make
    true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror, and who
else
    would trace 
him, his umbrage, nothing more.
  Osr. Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
  Ham. The con
cernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our
more
    rawer breath?
  Osr. Sir?
  Hor [asi
de to Hamlet] Is't not possible to understand in
another
    tongue? You will do't, sir, really.

  Ham. What imports the nomination of this gentleman?
  Osr. Of Laertes?
  Hor. [aside] His purse 
is empty already. All's golden words are
    spent.
  Ham. Of him, sir.
  Osr. I know you are not
 ignorant-
  Ham. I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would
not
    much approve 
me. Well, sir?
  Osr. You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is-
  Ham. I dare not confes
s that, lest I should compare with him in
    excellence; but to know a man well were to know himse
lf.
  Osr. I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on
him
    by them, in his mee
d he's unfellowed.
  Ham. What's his weapon?
  Osr. Rapier and dagger.
  Ham. That's two of his w
eapons- but well.
  Osr. The King, sir, hath wager'd with him six Barbary horses;
    against the 
which he has impon'd, as I take it, six French
    rapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as gir
dle, hangers,
and
    so. Three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy,
    very resp
onsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of
    very liberal conceit.
  Ham. What call yo
u the carriages?
  Hor. [aside to Hamlet] I knew you must be edified by the
margent
    ere you h
ad done.
  Osr. The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
  Ham. The phrase would be more germane to th
e matter if we could
    carry cannon by our sides. I would it might be hangers till
then.
    Bu
t on! Six Barbary horses against six French swords, their
    assigns, and three liberal-conceited 
carriages: that's the
French
    bet against the Danish. Why is this all impon'd, as you call
it?

  Osr. The King, sir, hath laid that, in a dozen passes between
    yourself and him, he shall no
t exceed you three hits; he hath
    laid on twelve for nine, and it would come to immediate trial

    if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.
  Ham. How if I answer no?
  Osr. I mean, my lor
d, the opposition of your person in trial.
  Ham. Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please h
is
Majesty,
    it is the breathing time of day with me. Let the foils be
    brought, the gentle
man willing, and the King hold his
purpose,
    I will win for him if I can; if not, I will gain n
othing but
my
    shame and the odd hits.
  Osr. Shall I redeliver you e'en so?
  Ham. To this e
ffect, sir, after what flourish your nature will.
  Osr. I commend my duty to your lordship.
  Ham
. Yours, yours. [Exit Osric.] He does well to commend it
    himself; there are no tongues else for
's turn.
  Hor. This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.
  Ham. He did comply with his d
ug before he suck'd it. Thus has
he,
    and many more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age

dotes
    on, only got the tune of the time and outward habit of
encounter-
    a kind of yesty
 collection, which carries them through and
    through the most fann'd and winnowed opinions; and 
do but
blow
    them to their trial-the bubbles are out,

                            Enter a Lo
rd.

  Lord. My lord, his Majesty commended him to you by young Osric,
who
    brings back to hi
m, that you attend him in the hall. He sends
to
    know if your pleasure hold to play with Laerte
s, or that you
will
    take longer time.
  Ham. I am constant to my purposes; they follow the Ki
ng's
pleasure.
    If his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or whensoever,
provided
    I be so
 able as now.
  Lord. The King and Queen and all are coming down.
  Ham. In happy time.
  Lord. T
he Queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to
    Laertes before you fall to play.
  Ha
m. She well instructs me.
                                                    [Exit Lord.]
  Hor. 
You will lose this wager, my lord.
  Ham. I do not think so. Since he went into France I have been

in
    continual practice. I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst
not
    think how ill all's
 here about my heart. But it is no matter.
  Hor. Nay, good my lord -
  Ham. It is but foolery; bu
t it is such a kind of gaingiving as
    would perhaps trouble a woman.
  Hor. If your mind dislik
e anything, obey it. I will forestall
their
    repair hither and say you are not fit.
  Ham. Not
 a whit, we defy augury; there's a special providence
in
    the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 
'tis not to come; if it
be
    not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will
come:

    the readiness is all. Since no man knows aught of what he
leaves,
    what is't to leave betim
es? Let be.

    Enter King, Queen, Laertes, Osric, and Lords, with other
              Attendant
s with foils and gauntlets.
               A table and flagons of wine on it.

  King. Come, Haml
et, come, and take this hand from me.
                    [The King puts Laertes' hand into Hamlet'
s.]
  Ham. Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong;
    But pardon't, as you are a gentlem
an.
    This presence knows,
    And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd
    With sore d
istraction. What I have done
    That might your nature, honour, and exception
    Roughly awake, 
I here proclaim was madness.
    Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet.
    If Hamlet from hi
mself be taken away,
    And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
    Then Hamlet does it not
, Hamlet denies it.
    Who does it, then? His madness. If't be so,
    Hamlet is of the faction t
hat is wrong'd;
    His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
    Sir, in this audience,
    Let my dis
claiming from a purpos'd evil
    Free me so far in your most generous thoughts
    That I have sh
ot my arrow o'er the house
    And hurt my brother.
  Laer. I am satisfied in nature,
    Whose m
otive in this case should stir me most
    To my revenge. But in my terms of honour
    I stand al
oof, and will no reconcilement
    Till by some elder masters of known honour
    I have a voice a
nd precedent of peace
    To keep my name ungor'd. But till that time
    I do receive your offer'
d love like love,
    And will not wrong it.
  Ham. I embrace it freely,
    And will this brothe
r's wager frankly play.
    Give us the foils. Come on.
  Laer. Come, one for me.
  Ham. I'll be 
your foil, Laertes. In mine ignorance
    Your skill shall, like a star i' th' darkest night,
    
Stick fiery off indeed.
  Laer. You mock me, sir.
  Ham. No, by this hand.
  King. Give them the 
foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
    You know the wager?
  Ham. Very well, my lord.
    Your Gr
ace has laid the odds o' th' weaker side.
  King. I do not fear it, I have seen you both;
    But 
since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.
  Laer. This is too heavy; let me see another.
  Ham
. This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
                                              
  Prepare to play.
  Osr. Ay, my good lord.
  King. Set me the stoups of wine upon that table.
  
  If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
    Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
    Let all
 the battlements their ordnance fire;
    The King shall drink to Hamlet's better breath,
    And 
in the cup an union shall he throw
    Richer than that which four successive kings
    In Denmark
's crown have worn. Give me the cups;
    And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
    The trumpet
 to the cannoneer without,
    The cannons to the heavens, the heaven to earth,
    'Now the King 
drinks to Hamlet.' Come, begin.
    And you the judges, bear a wary eye.
  Ham. Come on, sir.
  L
aer. Come, my lord.                                They play.
  Ham. One.
  Laer. No.
  Ham. Judg
ment!
  Osr. A hit, a very palpable hit.
  Laer. Well, again!
  King. Stay, give me drink. Hamlet
, this pearl is thine;
    Here's to thy health.
               [Drum; trumpets sound; a piece goe
s off [within].
    Give him the cup.
  Ham. I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile.
    Com
e. (They play.) Another hit. What say you?
  Laer. A touch, a touch; I do confess't.
  King. Our s
on shall win.
  Queen. He's fat, and scant of breath.
    Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy br
ows.
    The Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
  Ham. Good madam!
  King. Gertrude, do not d
rink.
  Queen. I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.          Drinks.
  King. [aside] It is the p
oison'd cup; it is too late.
  Ham. I dare not drink yet, madam; by-and-by.
  Queen. Come, let me 
wipe thy face.
  Laer. My lord, I'll hit him now.
  King. I do not think't.
  Laer. [aside] And y
et it is almost against my conscience.
  Ham. Come for the third, Laertes! You but dally.
    Pray
 you pass with your best violence;
    I am afeard you make a wanton of me.
  Laer. Say you so? Co
me on.                               Play.
  Osr. Nothing neither way.
  Laer. Have at you now!
 
               [Laertes wounds Hamlet; then] in scuffling, they
                    change rapiers,
 [and Hamlet wounds Laertes].
  King. Part them! They are incens'd.
  Ham. Nay come! again!       
                  The Queen falls.

  Osr. Look to the Queen there, ho!
  Hor. They bleed on both
 sides. How is it, my lord?
  Osr. How is't, Laertes?
  Laer. Why, as a woodcock to mine own sprin
ge, Osric.
    I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.
  Ham. How does the Queen?
  King. She
 sounds to see them bleed.
  Queen. No, no! the drink, the drink! O my dear Hamlet!
    The drink,
 the drink! I am poison'd.                 [Dies.]
  Ham. O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd.
 
   Treachery! Seek it out.
                                                [Laertes falls.]
  Laer
. It is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain;
    No medicine in the world can do thee good.
    I
n thee there is not half an hour of life.
    The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
    Unbat
ed and envenom'd. The foul practice
    Hath turn'd itself on me. Lo, here I lie,
    Never to ris
e again. Thy mother's poison'd.
    I can no more. The King, the King's to blame.
  Ham. The point
 envenom'd too?
    Then, venom, to thy work.                    Hurts the King.
  All. Treason! t
reason!
  King. O, yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt.
  Ham. Here, thou incestuous, murd'rous,
 damned Dane,
    Drink off this potion! Is thy union here?
    Follow my mother.                 
                King dies.
  Laer. He is justly serv'd.
    It is a poison temper'd by himself.
 
   Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet.
    Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,

    Nor thine on me!                                       Dies.
  Ham. Heaven make thee free of it
! I follow thee.
    I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!
    You that look pale and tremble
 at this chance,
    That are but mutes or audience to this act,
    Had I but time (as this fell 
sergeant, Death,
    Is strict in his arrest) O, I could tell you-
    But let it be. Horatio, I a
m dead;
    Thou liv'st; report me and my cause aright
    To the unsatisfied.
  Hor. Never belie
ve it.
    I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.
    Here's yet some liquor left.
  Ham. As th'
art a man,
    Give me the cup. Let go! By heaven, I'll ha't.
    O good Horatio, what a wounded n
ame
    (Things standing thus unknown) shall live behind me!
    If thou didst ever hold me in thy
 heart,
    Absent thee from felicity awhile,
    And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,

    To tell my story.         [March afar off, and shot within.]
    What warlike noise is this?

  Osr. Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
    To the ambassadors of England gives

    This warlike volley.
  Ham. O, I die, Horatio!
    The potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit
.
    I cannot live to hear the news from England,
    But I do prophesy th' election lights
    
On Fortinbras. He has my dying voice.
    So tell him, with th' occurrents, more and less,
    Whi
ch have solicited- the rest is silence.             Dies.
  Hor. Now cracks a noble heart. Good nig
ht, sweet prince,
    And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
                               
                  [March within.]
    Why does the drum come hither?

    Enter Fortinbras and En
glish Ambassadors, with Drum,
                  Colours, and Attendants.

  Fort. Where is this s
ight?
  Hor. What is it you will see?
    If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
  Fort. T
his quarry cries on havoc. O proud Death,
    What feast is toward in thine eternal cell
    That 
thou so many princes at a shot
    So bloodily hast struck.
  Ambassador. The sight is dismal;
  
  And our affairs from England come too late.
    The ears are senseless that should give us hearin
g
    To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd
    That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.
  
  Where should we have our thanks?
  Hor. Not from his mouth,
    Had it th' ability of life to th
ank you.
    He never gave commandment for their death.
    But since, so jump upon this bloody qu
estion,
    You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
    Are here arriv'd, give order that 
these bodies
    High on a stage be placed to the view;
    And let me speak to the yet unknowing 
world
    How these things came about. So shall you hear
    Of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts;

    Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters;
    Of deaths put on by cunning and forc'd cause;

    And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
    Fall'n on th' inventors' heads. All this can I
   
 Truly deliver.
  Fort. Let us haste to hear it,
    And call the noblest to the audience.
    Fo
r me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.
    I have some rights of memory in this kingdom
    Which
 now, to claim my vantage doth invite me.
  Hor. Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
    And
 from his mouth whose voice will draw on more.
    But let this same be presently perform'd,
    E
ven while men's minds are wild, lest more mischance
    On plots and errors happen.
  Fort. Let fo
ur captains
    Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage;
    For he was likely, had he been put on
,
    To have prov'd most royally; and for his passage
    The soldiers' music and the rites of wa
r
    Speak loudly for him.
    Take up the bodies. Such a sight as this
    Becomes the field bu
t here shows much amiss.
    Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
            Exeunt marching; after the wh
ich a peal of ordnance
                                                   are shot off.

ACT I. Scene I.
Elsinore. A platform before the Castl
e.

Enter two Sentinels-[first,] Francisco, [who paces up and down
at his post; then] Bernardo, [
who approaches him].

  Ber. Who's there?
  Fran. Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.
  B
er. Long live the King!
  Fran. Bernardo?
  Ber. He.
  Fran. You come most carefully upon your ho
ur.
  Ber. 'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.
  Fran. For this relief much thanks
. 'Tis bitter cold,
    And I am sick at heart.
  Ber. Have you had quiet guard?
  Fran. Not a mo
use stirring.
  Ber. Well, good night.
    If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
    The rivals o
f my watch, bid them make haste.

                    Enter Horatio and Marcellus.

  Fran. I th
ink I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?
  Hor. Friends to this ground.
  Mar. And liegemen to th
e Dane.
  Fran. Give you good night.
  Mar. O, farewell, honest soldier.
    Who hath reliev'd yo
u?
  Fran. Bernardo hath my place.
    Give you good night.                                   Exit
.
  Mar. Holla, Bernardo!
  Ber. Say-
    What, is Horatio there ?
  Hor. A piece of him.
  Ber
. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.
  Mar. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?

  Ber. I have seen nothing.
  Mar. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
    And will not let belief 
take hold of him
    Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.
    Therefore I have entreated
 him along,
    With us to watch the minutes of this night,
    That, if again this apparition com
e,
    He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
  Hor. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
  Ber. Sit 
down awhile,
    And let us once again assail your ears,
    That are so fortified against our sto
ry,
    What we two nights have seen.
  Hor. Well, sit we down,
    And let us hear Bernardo spea
k of this.
  Ber. Last night of all,
    When yond same star that's westward from the pole
    Ha
d made his course t' illume that part of heaven
    Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
    
The bell then beating one-

                        Enter Ghost.

  Mar. Peace! break thee off! 
Look where it comes again!
  Ber. In the same figure, like the King that's dead.
  Mar. Thou art a
 scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
  Ber. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.
  Hor. Most l
ike. It harrows me with fear and wonder.
  Ber. It would be spoke to.
  Mar. Question it, Horatio.

  Hor. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night
    Together with that fair and warlike for
m
    In which the majesty of buried Denmark
    Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee spea
k!
  Mar. It is offended.
  Ber. See, it stalks away!
  Hor. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee sp
eak!
                                                     Exit Ghost.
  Mar. 'Tis gone and will no
t answer.
  Ber. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale.
    Is not this something more than 
fantasy?
    What think you on't?
  Hor. Before my God, I might not this believe
    Without the 
sensible and true avouch
    Of mine own eyes.
  Mar. Is it not like the King?
  Hor. As thou art
 to thyself.
    Such was the very armour he had on
    When he th' ambitious Norway combated.
  
  So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,
    He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
    'Ti
s strange.
  Mar. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
    With martial stalk hath he go
ne by our watch.
  Hor. In what particular thought to work I know not;
    But, in the gross and s
cope of my opinion,
    This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
  Mar. Good now, sit down, 
and tell me he that knows,
    Why this same strict and most observant watch
    So nightly toils 
the subject of the land,
    And why such daily cast of brazen cannon
    And foreign mart for imp
lements of war;
    Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
    Does not divide the Sunda
y from the week.
    What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
    Doth make the night joint-la
bourer with the day?
    Who is't that can inform me?
  Hor. That can I.
    At least, the whispe
r goes so. Our last king,
    Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
    Was, as you know, by Fo
rtinbras of Norway,
    Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
    Dar'd to the combat; in wh
ich our valiant Hamlet
    (For so this side of our known world esteem'd him)
    Did slay this Fo
rtinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,
    Well ratified by law and heraldry,
    Did forfeit, with h
is life, all those his lands
    Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror;
    Against the which
 a moiety competent
    Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
    To the inheritance of Fortin
bras,
    Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant
    And carriage of the article design'
d,
    His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
    Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
   
 Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,
    Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
    For
 food and diet, to some enterprise
    That hath a stomach in't; which is no other,
    As it doth
 well appear unto our state,
    But to recover of us, by strong hand
    And terms compulsatory, 
those foresaid lands
    So by his father lost; and this, I take it,
    Is the main motive of our
 preparations,
    The source of this our watch, and the chief head
    Of this post-haste and rom
age in the land.
  Ber. I think it be no other but e'en so.
    Well may it sort that this portent
ous figure
    Comes armed through our watch, so like the King
    That was and is the question of
 these wars.
  Hor. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
    In the most high and palmy state o
f Rome,
    A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
    The graves stood tenantless, and the sheet
ed dead
    Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;
    As stars with trains of fire, and dews
 of blood,
    Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
    Upon whose influence Neptune's empire 
stands
    Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.
    And even the like precurse of fierce even
ts,
    As harbingers preceding still the fates
    And prologue to the omen coming on,
    Have 
heaven and earth together demonstrated
    Unto our climature and countrymen.

                  
    Enter Ghost again.

    But soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again!
    I'll cross it, though
 it blast me.- Stay illusion!
                                               Spreads his arms.
   
 If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
    Speak to me.
    If there be any good thing to be do
ne,
    That may to thee do ease, and, race to me,
    Speak to me.
    If thou art privy to thy 
country's fate,
    Which happily foreknowing may avoid,
    O, speak!
    Or if thou hast uphoar
ded in thy life
    Extorted treasure in the womb of earth
    (For which, they say, you spirits o
ft walk in death),
                                                 The cock crows.
    Speak of i
t! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!
  Mar. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
  Hor. Do, 
if it will not stand.
  Ber. 'Tis here!
  Hor. 'Tis here!
  Mar. 'Tis gone!
                    
                                 Exit Ghost.
    We do it wrong, being so majestical,
    To offer
 it the show of violence;
    For it is as the air, invulnerable,
    And our vain blows malicious
 mockery.
  Ber. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
  Hor. And then it started, like a gui
lty thing
    Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
    The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,

    Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
    Awake the god of day; and at his warning,

    Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
    Th' extravagant and erring spirit hies
    To his
 confine; and of the truth herein
    This present object made probation.
  Mar. It faded on the c
rowing of the cock.
    Some say that ever, 'gainst that season comes
    Wherein our Saviour's bi
rth is celebrated,
    The bird of dawning singeth all night long;
    And then, they say, no spir
it dare stir abroad,
    The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,
    No fairy takes, nor
 witch hath power to charm,
    So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
  Hor. So have I heard an
d do in part believe it.
    But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
    Walks o'er the dew of 
yon high eastward hill.
    Break we our watch up; and by my advice
    Let us impart what we have
 seen to-night
    Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
    This spirit, dumb to us, will speak t
o him.
    Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
    As needful in our loves, fitting our 
duty?
    Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
    Where we shall find him most convenientl
y.           Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A room of state in the Castle.

Flourish. [Ente
r Claudius, King of Denmark, Gertrude the Queen,
Hamlet,
Polonius, Laertes and his sister Ophelia,
 [Voltemand, Cornelius,]
Lords Attendant.

  King. Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death

    The memory be green, and that it us befitted
    To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole ki
ngdom
    To be contracted in one brow of woe,
    Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature

    That we with wisest sorrow think on him
    Together with remembrance of ourselves.
    Theref
ore our sometime sister, now our queen,
    Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,
    Have
 we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,
    With an auspicious, and a dropping eye,
    With mirth in 
funeral, and with dirge in marriage,
    In equal scale weighing delight and dole,
    Taken to wi
fe; nor have we herein barr'd
    Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
    With this affair
 along. For all, our thanks.
    Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
    Holding a weak 
supposal of our worth,
    Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
    Our state to be disjoi
nt and out of frame,
    Colleagued with this dream of his advantage,
    He hath not fail'd to pe
ster us with message
    Importing the surrender of those lands
    Lost by his father, with all b
ands of law,
    To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
    Now for ourself and for this ti
me of meeting.
    Thus much the business is: we have here writ
    To Norway, uncle of young Fort
inbras,
    Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears
    Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress

    His further gait herein, in that the levies,
    The lists, and full proportions are all made

    Out of his subject; and we here dispatch
    You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,
    Fo
r bearers of this greeting to old Norway,
    Giving to you no further personal power
    To busin
ess with the King, more than the scope
    Of these dilated articles allow.            [Gives a pap
er.]
    Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
  Cor., Volt. In that, and all things, wi
ll we show our duty.
  King. We doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell.
                             
    Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius.
    And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
    You told u
s of some suit. What is't, Laertes?
    You cannot speak of reason to the Dane
    And lose your v
oice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
    That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
    The head
 is not more native to the heart,
    The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
    Than is the thr
one of Denmark to thy father.
    What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
  Laer. My dread lord,
    You
r leave and favour to return to France;
    From whence though willingly I came to Denmark
    To 
show my duty in your coronation,
    Yet now I must confess, that duty done,
    My thoughts and w
ishes bend again toward France
    And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
  King. Have yo
u your father's leave? What says Polonius?
  Pol. He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
  
  By laboursome petition, and at last
    Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent.
    I do beseech
 you give him leave to go.
  King. Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,
    And thy best gr
aces spend it at thy will!
    But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son-
  Ham. [aside] A little more
 than kin, and less than kind!
  King. How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
  Ham. Not so,
 my lord. I am too much i' th' sun.
  Queen. Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
    And let
 thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
    Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
    Seek for th
y noble father in the dust.
    Thou know'st 'tis common. All that lives must die,
    Passing thr
ough nature to eternity.
  Ham. Ay, madam, it is common.
  Queen. If it be,
    Why seems it so p
articular with thee?
  Ham. Seems, madam, Nay, it is. I know not 'seems.'
    'Tis not alone my in
ky cloak, good mother,
    Nor customary suits of solemn black,
    Nor windy suspiration of forc'
d breath,
    No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
    Nor the dejected havior of the visage,
 
   Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
    'That can denote me truly. These indeed see
m,
    For they are actions that a man might play;
    But I have that within which passeth show-

    These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
  King. 'Tis sweet and commendable in your natur
e, Hamlet,
    To give these mourning duties to your father;
    But you must know, your father lo
st a father;
    That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
    In filial obligation for s
ome term
    To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever
    In obstinate condolement is a course
  
  Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief;
    It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
    A
 heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
    An understanding simple and unschool'd;
    For what we 
know must be, and is as common
    As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
    Why should we in our
 peevish opposition
    Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
    A fault against the dea
d, a fault to nature,
    To reason most absurd, whose common theme
    Is death of fathers, and w
ho still hath cried,
    From the first corse till he that died to-day,
    'This must be so.' We 
pray you throw to earth
    This unprevailing woe, and think of us
    As of a father; for let the
 world take note
    You are the most immediate to our throne,
    And with no less nobility of lo
ve
    Than that which dearest father bears his son
    Do I impart toward you. For your intent
 
   In going back to school in Wittenberg,
    It is most retrograde to our desire;
    And we bese
ech you, bend you to remain
    Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
    Our chiefest courtie
r, cousin, and our son.
  Queen. Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.
    I pray thee stay
 with us, go not to Wittenberg.
  Ham. I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
  King. Why, 'tis a
 loving and a fair reply.
    Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come.
    This gentle and unforc'd 
accord of Hamlet
    Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,
    No jocund health that Denmark
 drinks to-day
    But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
    And the King's rouse the hea
ven shall bruit again,
    Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.
                                
Flourish. Exeunt all but Hamlet.
  Ham. O that this too too solid flesh would melt,
    Thaw, and 
resolve itself into a dew!
    Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
    His canon 'gainst self-sl
aughter! O God! God!
    How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
    Seem to me all the uses of t
his world!
    Fie on't! ah, fie! 'Tis an unweeded garden
    That grows to seed; things rank and 
gross in nature
    Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
    But two months dead! Nay, 
not so much, not two.
    So excellent a king, that was to this
    Hyperion to a satyr; so loving
 to my mother
    That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
    Visit her face too roughly. Hea
ven and earth!
    Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him
    As if increase of appetite had 
grown
    By what it fed on; and yet, within a month-
    Let me not think on't! Frailty, thy name
 is woman!-
    A little month, or ere those shoes were old
    With which she followed my poor fa
ther's body
    Like Niobe, all tears- why she, even she
    (O God! a beast that wants discourse 
of reason
    Would have mourn'd longer) married with my uncle;
    My father's brother, but no mo
re like my father
    Than I to Hercules. Within a month,
    Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous
 tears
    Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
    She married. O, most wicked speed, to pos
t
    With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
    It is not, nor it cannot come to good.
    Bu
t break my heart, for I must hold my tongue!

          Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo.


  Hor. Hail to your lordship!
  Ham. I am glad to see you well.
    Horatio!- or I do forget myse
lf.
  Hor. The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
  Ham. Sir, my good friend- I'll change 
that name with you.
    And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?
    Marcellus?
  Mar. My good
 lord!
  Ham. I am very glad to see you.- [To Bernardo] Good even, sir.-

    But what, in faith,
 make you from Wittenberg?
  Hor. A truant disposition, good my lord.
  Ham. I would not hear your
 enemy say so,
    Nor shall you do my ear that violence
    To make it truster of your own report

    Against yourself. I know you are no truant.
    But what is your affair in Elsinore?
    We'
ll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
  Hor. My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
  
Ham. I prithee do not mock me, fellow student.
    I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
  Ho
r. Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.
  Ham. Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats

    Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
    Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
  
  Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
    My father- methinks I see my father.
  Hor. O, where, 
my lord?
  Ham. In my mind's eye, Horatio.
  Hor. I saw him once. He was a goodly king.
  Ham. He
 was a man, take him for all in all.
    I shall not look upon his like again.
  Hor. My lord, I t
hink I saw him yesternight.
  Ham. Saw? who?
  Hor. My lord, the King your father.
  Ham. The Kin
g my father?
  Hor. Season your admiration for a while
    With an attent ear, till I may deliver

    Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
    This marvel to you.
  Ham. For God's love let me hea
r!
  Hor. Two nights together had these gentlemen
    (Marcellus and Bernardo) on their watch
   
 In the dead vast and middle of the night
    Been thus encount'red. A figure like your father,
  
  Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
    Appears before them and with solemn march
    Goes slow an
d stately by them. Thrice he walk'd
    By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
    Within his
 truncheon's length; whilst they distill'd
    Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
    Stand dum
b and speak not to him. This to me
    In dreadful secrecy impart they did,
    And I with them th
e third night kept the watch;
    Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
    Form of the thin
g, each word made true and good,
    The apparition comes. I knew your father.
    These hands are
 not more like.
  Ham. But where was this?
  Mar. My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
  
Ham. Did you not speak to it?
  Hor. My lord, I did;
    But answer made it none. Yet once methoug
ht
    It lifted up it head and did address
    Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
    But
 even then the morning cock crew loud,
    And at the sound it shrunk in haste away
    And vanish
'd from our sight.
  Ham. 'Tis very strange.
  Hor. As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
  
  And we did think it writ down in our duty
    To let you know of it.
  Ham. Indeed, indeed, sirs
. But this troubles me.
    Hold you the watch to-night?
  Both [Mar. and Ber.] We do, my lord.
 
 Ham. Arm'd, say you?
  Both. Arm'd, my lord.
  Ham. From top to toe?
  Both. My lord, from head 
to foot.
  Ham. Then saw you not his face?
  Hor. O, yes, my lord! He wore his beaver up.
  Ham. 
What, look'd he frowningly.
  Hor. A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
  Ham. Pale or red?

  Hor. Nay, very pale.
  Ham. And fix'd his eyes upon you?
  Hor. Most constantly.
  Ham. I wou
ld I had been there.
  Hor. It would have much amaz'd you.
  Ham. Very like, very like. Stay'd it 
long?
  Hor. While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
  Both. Longer, longer.
  Hor. N
ot when I saw't.
  Ham. His beard was grizzled- no?
  Hor. It was, as I have seen it in his life,

    A sable silver'd.
  Ham. I will watch to-night.
    Perchance 'twill walk again.
  Hor. I wa
rr'nt it will.
  Ham. If it assume my noble father's person,
    I'll speak to it, though hell its
elf should gape
    And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
    If you have hitherto conceal'd t
his sight,
    Let it be tenable in your silence still;
    And whatsoever else shall hap to-night
,
    Give it an understanding but no tongue.
    I will requite your loves. So, fare you well.
 
   Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
    I'll visit you.
  All. Our duty to your honour
.
  Ham. Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell.
                                        Exeunt [all
 but Hamlet].
    My father's spirit- in arms? All is not well.
    I doubt some foul play. Would 
the night were come!
    Till then sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,
    Though all the ea
rth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
Exit.




Scene III.
Elsinore. A room in the house of Polo
nius.

Enter Laertes and Ophelia.

  Laer. My necessaries are embark'd. Farewell.
    And, sist
er, as the winds give benefit
    And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
    But let me hear from 
you.
  Oph. Do you doubt that?
  Laer. For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,
    Hold it a 
fashion, and a toy in blood;
    A violet in the youth of primy nature,
    Forward, not permanent
- sweet, not lasting;
    The perfume and suppliance of a minute;
    No more.
  Oph. No more but
 so?
  Laer. Think it no more.
    For nature crescent does not grow alone
    In thews and bulk;
 but as this temple waxes,
    The inward service of the mind and soul
    Grows wide withal. Perh
aps he loves you now,
    And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
    The virtue of his will; but
 you must fear,
    His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
    For he himself is subject 
to his birth.
    He may not, as unvalued persons do,
    Carve for himself, for on his choice dep
ends
    The safety and health of this whole state,
    And therefore must his choice be circumscr
ib'd
    Unto the voice and yielding of that body
    Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he l
oves you,
    It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
    As he in his particular act and place

    May give his saying deed; which is no further
    Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.

    Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain
    If with too credent ear you list his songs,
 
   Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
    To his unmast'red importunity.
    Fear it
, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
    And keep you in the rear of your affection,
    Out of the
 shot and danger of desire.
    The chariest maid is prodigal enough
    If she unmask her beauty 
to the moon.
    Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes.
    The canker galls the infants of 
the spring
    Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd,
    And in the morn and liquid dew of yo
uth
    Contagious blastments are most imminent.
    Be wary then; best safety lies in fear.
    
Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
  Oph. I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep

    As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
    Do not as some ungracious pastors do,
    S
how me the steep and thorny way to heaven,
    Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
    H
imself the primrose path of dalliance treads
    And recks not his own rede.
  Laer. O, fear me no
t!

                       Enter Polonius.

    I stay too long. But here my father comes.
    
A double blessing is a double grace;
    Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
  Pol. Yet here, Lae
rtes? Aboard, aboard, for shame!
    The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
    And you are s
tay'd for. There- my blessing with thee!
    And these few precepts in thy memory
    Look thou ch
aracter. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
    Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.
    Be thou fami
liar, but by no means vulgar:
    Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
    Grapple t
hem unto thy soul with hoops of steel;
    But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
    Of each
 new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware
    Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,
    Bear't tha
t th' opposed may beware of thee.
    Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice;
    Take each m
an's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
    Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
    But not exp
ress'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
    For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
    And they in Franc
e of the best rank and station
    Are most select and generous, chief in that.
    Neither a borr
ower nor a lender be;
    For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
    And borrowing dulls the e
dge of husbandry.
    This above all- to thine own self be true,
    And it must follow, as the ni
ght the day,
    Thou canst not then be false to any man.
    Farewell. My blessing season this in
 thee!
  Laer. Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
  Pol. The time invites you. Go, your serv
ants tend.
  Laer. Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well
    What I have said to you.
  Oph. 'Tis 
in my memory lock'd,
    And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
  Laer. Farewell.             
                             Exit.
  Pol. What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?
  Oph. So pleas
e you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
  Pol. Marry, well bethought!
    'Tis told me he hath 
very oft of late
    Given private time to you, and you yourself
    Have of your audience been mo
st free and bounteous.
    If it be so- as so 'tis put on me,
    And that in way of caution- I mu
st tell you
    You do not understand yourself so clearly
    As it behooves my daughter and your 
honour.
    What is between you? Give me up the truth.
  Oph. He hath, my lord, of late made many 
tenders
    Of his affection to me.
  Pol. Affection? Pooh! You speak like a green girl,
    Unsi
fted in such perilous circumstance.
    Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
  Oph. I do 
not know, my lord, what I should think,
  Pol. Marry, I will teach you! Think yourself a baby
    
That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
    Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more de
arly,
    Or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
    Running it thus) you'll tender me a fo
ol.
  Oph. My lord, he hath importun'd me with love
    In honourable fashion.
  Pol. Ay, fashion
 you may call it. Go to, go to!
  Oph. And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
    With
 almost all the holy vows of heaven.
  Pol. Ay, springes to catch woodcocks! I do know,
    When t
he blood burns, how prodigal the soul
    Lends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter,
    Givin
g more light than heat, extinct in both
    Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
    You must
 not take for fire. From this time
    Be something scanter of your maiden presence.
    Set your 
entreatments at a higher rate
    Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
    Believe so much i
n him, that he is young,
    And with a larger tether may he walk
    Than may be given you. In fe
w, Ophelia,
    Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
    Not of that dye which their inv
estments show,
    But mere implorators of unholy suits,
    Breathing like sanctified and pious b
awds,
    The better to beguile. This is for all:
    I would not, in plain terms, from this time 
forth
    Have you so slander any moment leisure
    As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet
.
    Look to't, I charge you. Come your ways.
  Oph. I shall obey, my lord.
                    
                                     Exeunt.




Scene IV.
Elsinore. The platform before the C
astle.

Enter Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus.

  Ham. The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.

  Hor. It is a nipping and an eager air.
  Ham. What hour now?
  Hor. I think it lacks of twelve.

  Mar. No, it is struck.
  Hor. Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws near the season
    Wherein
 the spirit held his wont to walk.
                   A flourish of trumpets, and two pieces go off
.
    What does this mean, my lord?
  Ham. The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
    K
eeps wassail, and the swagg'ring upspring reels,
    And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down
,
    The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out
    The triumph of his pledge.
  Hor. Is it a cust
om?
  Ham. Ay, marry, is't;
    But to my mind, though I am native here
    And to the manner bor
n, it is a custom
    More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
    This heavy-headed revel
 east and west
    Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations;
    They clip us drunkards and wi
th swinish phrase
    Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
    From our achievements, though per
form'd at height,
    The pith and marrow of our attribute.
    So oft it chances in particular me
n
    That, for some vicious mole of nature in them,
    As in their birth,- wherein they are not 
guilty,
    Since nature cannot choose his origin,-
    By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
   
 Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
    Or by some habit that too much o'erleavens
 
   The form of plausive manners, that these men
    Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
    
Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,
    Their virtues else- be they as pure as grace,
    As
 infinite as man may undergo-
    Shall in the general censure take corruption
    From that parti
cular fault. The dram of e'il
    Doth all the noble substance often dout To his own scandal.

  
                       Enter Ghost.

  Hor. Look, my lord, it comes!
  Ham. Angels and ministers 
of grace defend us!
    Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
    Bring with thee airs from
 heaven or blasts from hell,
    Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
    Thou com'st in such a qu
estionable shape
    That I will speak to thee. I'll call thee Hamlet,
    King, father, royal Dan
e. O, answer me?
    Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell
    Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed 
in death,
    Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre
    Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'
d,
    Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws
    To cast thee up again. What may this mean
    
That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,
    Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
    Ma
king night hideous, and we fools of nature
    So horridly to shake our disposition
    With thoug
hts beyond the reaches of our souls?
    Say, why is this? wherefore? What should we do?
         
                                  Ghost beckons Hamlet.
  Hor. It beckons you to go away with it,

    As if it some impartment did desire
    To you alone.
  Mar. Look with what courteous action

    It waves you to a more removed ground.
    But do not go with it!
  Hor. No, by no means!
  H
am. It will not speak. Then will I follow it.
  Hor. Do not, my lord!
  Ham. Why, what should be t
he fear?
    I do not set my life at a pin's fee;
    And for my soul, what can it do to that,
  
  Being a thing immortal as itself?
    It waves me forth again. I'll follow it.
  Hor. What if it
 tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
    Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
    That beetles 
o'er his base into the sea,
    And there assume some other, horrible form
    Which might deprive
 your sovereignty of reason
    And draw you into madness? Think of it.
    The very place puts to
ys of desperation,
    Without more motive, into every brain
    That looks so many fadoms to the 
sea
    And hears it roar beneath.
  Ham. It waves me still.
    Go on. I'll follow thee.
  Mar.
 You shall not go, my lord.
  Ham. Hold off your hands!
  Hor. Be rul'd. You shall not go.
  Ham.
 My fate cries out
    And makes each petty artire in this body
    As hardy as the Nemean lion's 
nerve.
                                                [Ghost beckons.]

    Still am I call'd. U
nhand me, gentlemen.
    By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!-
    I say, away!- Go o
n. I'll follow thee.
                                        Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet.
  Hor. He wa
xes desperate with imagination.
  Mar. Let's follow. 'Tis not fit thus to obey him.
  Hor. Have af
ter. To what issue will this come?
  Mar. Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
  Hor. Heav
en will direct it.
  Mar. Nay, let's follow him.
                                                 
        Exeunt.




Scene V.
Elsinore. The Castle. Another part of the fortifications.

Ente
r Ghost and Hamlet.

  Ham. Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak! I'll go no further.
  Ghost. Mark m
e.
  Ham. I will.
  Ghost. My hour is almost come,
    When I to sulph'rous and tormenting flames

    Must render up myself.
  Ham. Alas, poor ghost!
  Ghost. Pity me not, but lend thy serious h
earing
    To what I shall unfold.
  Ham. Speak. I am bound to hear.
  Ghost. So art thou to reve
nge, when thou shalt hear.
  Ham. What?
  Ghost. I am thy father's spirit,
    Doom'd for a certa
in term to walk the night,
    And for the day confin'd to fast in fires,
    Till the foul crimes
 done in my days of nature
    Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid
    To tell the sec
rets of my prison house,
    I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
    Would harrow up thy sou
l, freeze thy young blood,
    Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
    Thy kn
otted and combined locks to part,
    And each particular hair to stand on end
    Like quills upo
n the fretful porcupine.
    But this eternal blazon must not be
    To ears of flesh and blood. L
ist, list, O, list!
    If thou didst ever thy dear father love-
  Ham. O God!
  Ghost. Revenge h
is foul and most unnatural murther.
  Ham. Murther?
  Ghost. Murther most foul, as in the best it 
is;
    But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.
  Ham. Haste me to know't, that I, with wings 
as swift
    As meditation or the thoughts of love,
    May sweep to my revenge.
  Ghost. I find 
thee apt;
    And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
    That rots itself in ease on Lethe 
wharf,
    Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.
    'Tis given out that, sleeping in 
my orchard,
    A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark
    Is by a forged process of my d
eath
    Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth,
    The serpent that did sting thy father's li
fe
    Now wears his crown.
  Ham. O my prophetic soul!
    My uncle?
  Ghost. Ay, that incestuo
us, that adulterate beast,
    With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts-
    O wicked wit
 and gifts, that have the power
    So to seduce!- won to his shameful lust
    The will of my mos
t seeming-virtuous queen.
    O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there,
    From me, whose love was 
of that dignity
    That it went hand in hand even with the vow
    I made to her in marriage, and
 to decline
    Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
    To those of mine!
    But virtue,
 as it never will be mov'd,
    Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
    So lust, though
 to a radiant angel link'd,
    Will sate itself in a celestial bed
    And prey on garbage.
    
But soft! methinks I scent the morning air.
    Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
    M
y custom always of the afternoon,
    Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
    With juice of curse
d hebona in a vial,
    And in the porches of my ears did pour
    The leperous distilment; whose 
effect
    Holds such an enmity with blood of man
    That swift as quicksilver it courses through

    The natural gates and alleys of the body,
    And with a sudden vigour it doth posset
    An
d curd, like eager droppings into milk,
    The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine;
    And 
a most instant tetter bark'd about,
    Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust
    All my 
smooth body.
    Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
    Of life, of crown, of queen, at onc
e dispatch'd;
    Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
    Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd,

    No reckoning made, but sent to my account
    With all my imperfections on my head.
  Ham. O,
 horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
  Ghost. If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.
    Let 
not the royal bed of Denmark be
    A couch for luxury and damned incest.
    But, howsoever thou 
pursuest this act,
    Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
    Against thy mother aught.
 Leave her to heaven,
    And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge
    To prick and sting her. 
Fare thee well at once.
    The glowworm shows the matin to be near
    And gins to pale his uneff
ectual fire.
    Adieu, adieu, adieu! Remember me.                      Exit.

  Ham. O all you h
ost of heaven! O earth! What else?
    And shall I couple hell? Hold, hold, my heart!
    And you,
 my sinews, grow not instant old,
    But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?
    Ay, thou poor gho
st, while memory holds a seat
    In this distracted globe. Remember thee?
    Yea, from the table
 of my memory
    I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
    All saws of books, all forms, all p
ressures past
    That youth and observation copied there,
    And thy commandment all alone shall
 live
    Within the book and volume of my brain,
    Unmix'd with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!

    O most pernicious woman!
    O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
    My tables! Meet 
it is I set it down
    That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
    At least I am sure it
 may be so in Denmark.        [Writes.]
    So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word:
    It is 'A
dieu, adieu! Remember me.'
    I have sworn't.
  Hor. (within) My lord, my lord!

              
     Enter Horatio and Marcellus.

  Mar. Lord Hamlet!
  Hor. Heaven secure him!
  Ham. So be it
!
  Mar. Illo, ho, ho, my lord!
  Ham. Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.
  Mar. How is't, my 
noble lord?
  Hor. What news, my lord?
  Mar. O, wonderful!
  Hor. Good my lord, tell it.
  Ham.
 No, you will reveal it.
  Hor. Not I, my lord, by heaven!
  Mar. Nor I, my lord.
  Ham. How say 
you then? Would heart of man once think it?
    But you'll be secret?
  Both. Ay, by heaven, my lo
rd.
  Ham. There's neer a villain dwelling in all Denmark
    But he's an arrant knave.
  Hor. Th
ere needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
    To tell us this.
  Ham. Why, right! You are i
n the right!
    And so, without more circumstance at all,
    I hold it fit that we shake hands a
nd part;
    You, as your business and desires shall point you,
    For every man hath business an
d desire,
    Such as it is; and for my own poor part,
    Look you, I'll go pray.
  Hor. These a
re but wild and whirling words, my lord.
  Ham. I am sorry they offend you, heartily;
    Yes, fai
th, heartily.
  Hor. There's no offence, my lord.
  Ham. Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Hora
tio,
    And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
    It is an honest ghost, that let me t
ell you.
    For your desire to know what is between us,
    O'ermaster't as you may. And now, goo
d friends,
    As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,
    Give me one poor request.
  Hor. W
hat is't, my lord? We will.
  Ham. Never make known what you have seen to-night.
  Both. My lord, 
we will not.
  Ham. Nay, but swear't.
  Hor. In faith,
    My lord, not I.
  Mar. Nor I, my lord
- in faith.
  Ham. Upon my sword.
  Mar. We have sworn, my lord, already.
  Ham. Indeed, upon my 
sword, indeed.

                 Ghost cries under the stage.

  Ghost. Swear.
  Ham. Aha boy, 
say'st thou so? Art thou there, truepenny?
    Come on! You hear this fellow in the cellarage.
   
 Consent to swear.
  Hor. Propose the oath, my lord.
  Ham. Never to speak of this that you have s
een.
    Swear by my sword.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
  Ham. Hic et ubique? Then we'll shift our 
ground.
    Come hither, gentlemen,
    And lay your hands again upon my sword.
    Never to spea
k of this that you have heard:
    Swear by my sword.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear by his sword.
  Ha
m. Well said, old mole! Canst work i' th' earth so fast?
    A worthy pioner! Once more remove, goo
d friends."
  Hor. O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
  Ham. And therefore as a strang
er give it welcome.
    There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
    Than are dreamt of
 in your philosophy.
    But come!
    Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
    How strange
 or odd soe'er I bear myself
    (As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
    To put an antic di
sposition on),
    That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
    With arms encumb'red thus, 
or this head-shake,
    Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
    As 'Well, well, we know,' o
r 'We could, an if we would,'
    Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'
    O
r such ambiguous giving out, to note
    That you know aught of me- this is not to do,
    So grac
e and mercy at your most need help you,
    Swear.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
                    
                               [They swear.]
  Ham. Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! So, gentlemen,
 
   With all my love I do commend me to you;
    And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
    May do t' 
express his love and friending to you,
    God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;
   
 And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
    The time is out of joint. O cursed spite
    Tha
t ever I was born to set it right!
    Nay, come, let's go together.
                             
                            Exeunt.

Act II. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the h
ouse of Polonius.

Enter Polonius and Reynaldo.

  Pol. Give him this money and these notes, Rey
naldo.
  Rey. I will, my lord.
  Pol. You shall do marvell's wisely, good Reynaldo,
    Before Yo
u visit him, to make inquire
    Of his behaviour.
  Rey. My lord, I did intend it.
  Pol. Marry,
 well said, very well said. Look you, sir,
    Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
    An
d how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
    What company, at what expense; and finding
  
  By this encompassment and drift of question
    That they do know my son, come you more nearer
 
   Than your particular demands will touch it.
    Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of h
im;
    As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
    And in part him.' Do you mark this, Reyna
ldo?
  Rey. Ay, very well, my lord.
  Pol. 'And in part him, but,' you may say, 'not well.
    Bu
t if't be he I mean, he's very wild
    Addicted so and so'; and there put on him
    What forgeri
es you please; marry, none so rank
    As may dishonour him- take heed of that;
    But, sir, such
 wanton, wild, and usual slips
    As are companions noted and most known
    To youth and liberty
.
  Rey. As gaming, my lord.
  Pol. Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
    Drabbing
. You may go so far.
  Rey. My lord, that would dishonour him.
  Pol. Faith, no, as you may season
 it in the charge.
    You must not put another scandal on him,
    That he is open to incontinenc
y.
    That's not my meaning. But breathe his faults so quaintly
    That they may seem the taints
 of liberty,
    The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
    A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
 
   Of general assault.
  Rey. But, my good lord-
  Pol. Wherefore should you do this?
  Rey. Ay, 
my lord,
    I would know that.
  Pol. Marry, sir, here's my drift,
    And I believe it is a fet
ch of warrant.
    You laying these slight sullies on my son
    As 'twere a thing a little soil'd
 i' th' working,
    Mark you,
    Your party in converse, him you would sound,
    Having ever s
een in the prenominate crimes
    The youth you breathe of guilty, be assur'd
    He closes with y
ou in this consequence:
    'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman'-
    According to the p
hrase or the addition
    Of man and country-
  Rey. Very good, my lord.
  Pol. And then, sir, do
es 'a this- 'a does- What was I about to
say?
    By the mass, I was about to say something! Where
 did I leave?
  Rey. At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,' and
    gentleman.'
  Pol
. At 'closes in the consequence'- Ay, marry!
    He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman.
    I saw 
him yesterday, or t'other day,
    Or then, or then, with such or such; and, as you say,
    There
 was 'a gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
    There falling out at tennis'; or perchance,
    'I 
saw him enter such a house of sale,'
    Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
    See you now-
    
Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth;
    And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
    Wi
th windlasses and with assays of bias,
    By indirections find directions out.
    So, by my form
er lecture and advice,
    Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?
  Rey. My lord, I have.
 
 Pol. God b' wi' ye, fare ye well!
  Rey. Good my lord!                                    [Going.]

  Pol. Observe his inclination in yourself.
  Rey. I shall, my lord.
  Pol. And let him ply his 
music.
  Rey. Well, my lord.
  Pol. Farewell!
                                                  E
xit Reynaldo.

                       Enter Ophelia.

    How now, Ophelia? What's the matter?

  Oph. O my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
  Pol. With what, i' th' name of God?
  Oph.
 My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
    Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac'd,
    No hat
 upon his head, his stockings foul'd,
    Ungart'red, and down-gyved to his ankle;
    Pale as his
 shirt, his knees knocking each other,
    And with a look so piteous in purport
    As if he had 
been loosed out of hell
    To speak of horrors- he comes before me.
  Pol. Mad for thy love?
  O
ph. My lord, I do not know,
    But truly I do fear it.
  Pol. What said he?
  Oph. He took me by
 the wrist and held me hard;
    Then goes he to the length of all his arm,
    And, with his othe
r hand thus o'er his brow,
    He falls to such perusal of my face
    As he would draw it. Long s
tay'd he so.
    At last, a little shaking of mine arm,
    And thrice his head thus waving up and
 down,
    He rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound
    As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
  
  And end his being. That done, he lets me go,
    And with his head over his shoulder turn'd
    
He seem'd to find his way without his eyes,
    For out o' doors he went without their help
    An
d to the last bended their light on me.
  Pol. Come, go with me. I will go seek the King.
    This
 is the very ecstasy of love,
    Whose violent property fordoes itself
    And leads the will to 
desperate undertakings
    As oft as any passion under heaven
    That does afflict our natures. I
 am sorry.
    What, have you given him any hard words of late?
  Oph. No, my good lord; but, as y
ou did command,
    I did repel his letters and denied
    His access to me.
  Pol. That hath mad
e him mad.
    I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
    I had not quoted him. I fear'd he
 did but trifle
    And meant to wrack thee; but beshrew my jealousy!
    By heaven, it is as prop
er to our age
    To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
    As it is common for the younger sor
t
    To lack discretion. Come, go we to the King.
    This must be known; which, being kept close
, might move
    More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
    Come.
                          
                               Exeunt.

Scene II.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Flourish. [E
nter King and Queen, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern,
cum aliis.

  King. Welcome, dear Rosencrantz 
and Guildenstern.
    Moreover that we much did long to see you,
    The need we have to use you d
id provoke
    Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
    Of Hamlet's transformation. So I ca
ll it,
    Sith nor th' exterior nor the inward man
    Resembles that it was. What it should be,

    More than his father's death, that thus hath put him
    So much from th' understanding of him
self,
    I cannot dream of. I entreat you both
    That, being of so young days brought up with h
im,
    And since so neighbour'd to his youth and haviour,
    That you vouchsafe your rest here i
n our court
    Some little time; so by your companies
    To draw him on to pleasures, and to gat
her
    So much as from occasion you may glean,
    Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus

    That, open'd, lies within our remedy.
  Queen. Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,
  
  And sure I am two men there are not living
    To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
  
  To show us so much gentry and good will
    As to expend your time with us awhile
    For the su
pply and profit of our hope,
    Your visitation shall receive such thanks
    As fits a king's re
membrance.
  Ros. Both your Majesties
    Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
    Put y
our dread pleasures more into command
    Than to entreaty.
  Guil. But we both obey,
    And her
e give up ourselves, in the full bent,
    To lay our service freely at your feet,
    To be comma
nded.
  King. Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
  Queen. Thanks, Guildenstern and gentl
e Rosencrantz.
    And I beseech you instantly to visit
    My too much changed son.- Go, some of 
you,
    And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
  Guil. Heavens make our presence and our prac
tices
    Pleasant and helpful to him!
  Queen. Ay, amen!
                 Exeunt Rosencrantz and
 Guildenstern, [with some
                                                    Attendants].

     
                    Enter Polonius.

  Pol. Th' ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
    Are jo
yfully return'd.
  King. Thou still hast been the father of good news.
  Pol. Have I, my lord? Ass
ure you, my good liege,
    I hold my duty as I hold my soul,
    Both to my God and to my graciou
s king;
    And I do think- or else this brain of mine
    Hunts not the trail of policy so sure

    As it hath us'd to do- that I have found
    The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
  King. O, spe
ak of that! That do I long to hear.
  Pol. Give first admittance to th' ambassadors.
    My news s
hall be the fruit to that great feast.
  King. Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
      
                                          [Exit Polonius.]
    He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he ha
th found
    The head and source of all your son's distemper.
  Queen. I doubt it is no other but 
the main,
    His father's death and our o'erhasty marriage.
  King. Well, we shall sift him.

 
             Enter Polonius, Voltemand, and Cornelius.

    Welcome, my good friends.
    Say, Vo
ltemand, what from our brother Norway?
  Volt. Most fair return of greetings and desires.
    Upon
 our first, he sent out to suppress
    His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
    To be a pre
paration 'gainst the Polack,
    But better look'd into, he truly found
    It was against your Hi
ghness; whereat griev'd,
    That so his sickness, age, and impotence
    Was falsely borne in han
d, sends out arrests
    On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys,
    Receives rebuke from Norway
, and, in fine,
    Makes vow before his uncle never more
    To give th' assay of arms against yo
ur Majesty.
    Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
    Gives him three thousand crowns in annu
al fee
    And his commission to employ those soldiers,
    So levied as before, against the Polac
k;
    With an entreaty, herein further shown,
                                                [Gi
ves a paper.]
    That it might please you to give quiet pass
    Through your dominions for this 
enterprise,
    On such regards of safety and allowance
    As therein are set down.
  King. It l
ikes us well;
    And at our more consider'd time we'll read,
    Answer, and think upon this busi
ness.
    Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour.
    Go to your rest; at night we'll fea
st together.
    Most welcome home!                       Exeunt Ambassadors.
  Pol. This business
 is well ended.
    My liege, and madam, to expostulate
    What majesty should be, what duty is,

    Why day is day, night is night, and time is time.
    Were nothing but to waste night, day, an
d time.
    Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
    And tediousness the limbs and outward
 flourishes,
    I will be brief. Your noble son is mad.
    Mad call I it; for, to define true ma
dness,
    What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
    But let that go.
  Queen. More matter, w
ith less art.
  Pol. Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
    That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 
'tis pity;
    And pity 'tis 'tis true. A foolish figure!
    But farewell it, for I will use no a
rt.
    Mad let us grant him then. And now remains
    That we find out the cause of this effect-

    Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
    For this effect defective comes by cause.
    Th
us it remains, and the remainder thus.
    Perpend.
    I have a daughter (have while she is mine)
,
    Who in her duty and obedience, mark,
    Hath given me this. Now gather, and surmise.
     
                                        [Reads] the letter.
    'To the celestial, and my soul's id
ol, the most beautified
      Ophelia,'-

    That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' i
s a vile
      phrase.
    But you shall hear. Thus:
                                            
            [Reads.]
    'In her excellent white bosom, these, &c.'
  Queen. Came this from Hamlet
 to her?
  Pol. Good madam, stay awhile. I will be faithful.     [Reads.]


          'Doubt tho
u the stars are fire;
            Doubt that the sun doth move;
          Doubt truth to be a liar
;
            But never doubt I love.
      'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers; I have not
 art
to
    reckon my groans; but that I love thee best, O most best,
believe
    it. Adieu.
  
    'Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to
him,

HAMLET.'

    This, in obe
dience, hath my daughter shown me;
    And more above, hath his solicitings,
    As they fell out 
by time, by means, and place,
    All given to mine ear.
  King. But how hath she
    Receiv'd hi
s love?
  Pol. What do you think of me?
  King. As of a man faithful and honourable.
  Pol. I wou
ld fain prove so. But what might you think,
    When I had seen this hot love on the wing
    (As 
I perceiv'd it, I must tell you that,
    Before my daughter told me), what might you,
    Or my d
ear Majesty your queen here, think,
    If I had play'd the desk or table book,
    Or given my he
art a winking, mute and dumb,
    Or look'd upon this love with idle sight?
    What might you thi
nk? No, I went round to work
    And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
    'Lord Hamlet is a p
rince, out of thy star.
    This must not be.' And then I prescripts gave her,
    That she should
 lock herself from his resort,
    Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
    Which done, she too
k the fruits of my advice,
    And he, repulsed, a short tale to make,
    Fell into a sadness, th
en into a fast,
    Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
    Thence to a lightness, and, by 
this declension,
    Into the madness wherein now he raves,
    And all we mourn for.
  King. Do 
you think 'tis this?
  Queen. it may be, very like.
  Pol. Hath there been such a time- I would fa
in know that-
    That I have Positively said ''Tis so,'
    When it prov'd otherwise.?
  King. N
ot that I know.
  Pol. [points to his head and shoulder] Take this from this, if
this
      be ot
herwise.
    If circumstances lead me, I will find
    Where truth is hid, though it were hid inde
ed
    Within the centre.
  King. How may we try it further?
  Pol. You know sometimes he walks f
or hours together
    Here in the lobby.
  Queen. So he does indeed.
  Pol. At such a time I'll l
oose my daughter to him.
    Be you and I behind an arras then.
    Mark the encounter. If he love
 her not,
    And he not from his reason fall'n thereon
    Let me be no assistant for a state,
 
   But keep a farm and carters.
  King. We will try it.

                 Enter Hamlet, reading o
n a book.

  Queen. But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
  Pol. Away, I do beseech
 you, both away
    I'll board him presently. O, give me leave.
                       Exeunt King
 and Queen, [with Attendants].
    How does my good Lord Hamlet?
  Ham. Well, God-a-mercy.
  Pol.
 Do you know me, my lord?
  Ham. Excellent well. You are a fishmonger.
  Pol. Not I, my lord.
  H
am. Then I would you were so honest a man.
  Pol. Honest, my lord?
  Ham. Ay, sir. To be honest, a
s this world goes, is to be one
man
    pick'd out of ten thousand.
  Pol. That's very true, my l
ord.
  Ham. For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god
    kissing carrion- Have you 
a daughter?
  Pol. I have, my lord.
  Ham. Let her not walk i' th' sun. Conception is a blessing, 
but
not
    as your daughter may conceive. Friend, look to't.
  Pol. [aside] How say you by that?
 Still harping on my daughter.
Yet
    he knew me not at first. He said I was a fishmonger. He is

far
    gone, far gone! And truly in my youth I suff'red much
extremity
    for love- very near 
this. I'll speak to him again.- What do
you
    read, my lord?
  Ham. Words, words, words.
  Pol
. What is the matter, my lord?
  Ham. Between who?
  Pol. I mean, the matter that you read, my lor
d.
  Ham. Slanders, sir; for the satirical rogue says here that old
men
    have grey beards; tha
t their faces are wrinkled; their eyes
    purging thick amber and plum-tree gum; and that they hav
e a
    plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams. All
which,
    sir, though I most po
werfully and potently believe, yet I
hold it
    not honesty to have it thus set down; for you you
rself, sir,
    should be old as I am if, like a crab, you could go backward.

  Pol. [aside] Tho
ugh this be madness, yet there is a method
in't.-
   Will You walk out of the air, my lord?
  Ham
. Into my grave?
  Pol. Indeed, that is out o' th' air. [Aside] How pregnant
sometimes
    his re
plies are! a happiness that often madness hits on,
which
    reason and sanity could not so prospe
rously be delivered of.
I
    will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting
between

    him and my daughter.- My honourable lord, I will most humbly
take
    my leave of you.
  Ham.
 You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more
    willingly part withal- except my life,
 except my life, except
my
    life,

                    Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.


  Pol. Fare you well, my lord.
  Ham. These tedious old fools!
  Pol. You go to seek the Lord Ham
let. There he is.
  Ros. [to Polonius] God save you, sir!
                                        
        Exit [Polonius].

  Guil. My honour'd lord!
  Ros. My most dear lord!
  Ham. My excellen
t good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern?
Ah,
    Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
  Ro
s. As the indifferent children of the earth.
  Guil. Happy in that we are not over-happy.
    On F
ortune's cap we are not the very button.
  Ham. Nor the soles of her shoe?
  Ros. Neither, my lord
.
  Ham. Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her
    favours?
  Guil. Faith, her p
rivates we.
  Ham. In the secret parts of Fortune? O! most true! she is a
    strumpet. What news 
?
  Ros. None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
  Ham. Then is doomsday near! But your 
news is not true. Let me
    question more in particular. What have you, my good friends,
    dese
rved at the hands of Fortune that she sends you to prison
    hither?
  Guil. Prison, my lord?
  
Ham. Denmark's a prison.
  Ros. Then is the world one.
  Ham. A goodly one; in which there are man
y confines, wards, and
    dungeons, Denmark being one o' th' worst.
  Ros. We think not so, my lo
rd.
  Ham. Why, then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either
good
    or bad but thinking m
akes it so. To me it is a prison.
  Ros. Why, then your ambition makes it one. 'Tis too narrow for

your
    mind.
  Ham. O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a
    king of inf
inite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.
  Guil. Which dreams indeed are ambition; for the 
very substance
of
    the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
  Ham. A dream itself is but
 a shadow.
  Ros. Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality
that
    it is but a 
shadow's shadow.
  Ham. Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and
outstretch'd
    heroes
 the beggars' shadows. Shall we to th' court? for, by
my
    fay, I cannot reason.
  Both. We'll 
wait upon you.
  Ham. No such matter! I will not sort you with the rest of my
    servants; for, t
o speak to you like an honest man, I am most
    dreadfully attended. But in the beaten way of frie
ndship,
what
    make you at Elsinore?
  Ros. To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
  Ham. B
eggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank
you;
    and sure, dear friends, my thanks 
are too dear a halfpenny.
Were
    you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free
    v
isitation? Come, deal justly with me. Come, come! Nay,
speak.
  Guil. What should we say, my lord?

  Ham. Why, anything- but to th' purpose. You were sent for; and
    there is a kind of confessio
n in your looks, which your
modesties
    have not craft enough to colour. I know the good King an
d
Queen
    have sent for you.
  Ros. To what end, my lord?
  Ham. That you must teach me. But l
et me conjure you by the
rights
    of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the
   
 obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear
a
    better proposer could charge y
ou withal, be even and direct
with
    me, whether you were sent for or no.
  Ros. [aside to Guil
denstern] What say you?
  Ham. [aside] Nay then, I have an eye of you.- If you love me,
hold
    
not off.
  Guil. My lord, we were sent for.
  Ham. I will tell you why. So shall my anticipation p
revent your
    discovery, and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no
    feather. I have of 
late- but wherefore I know not- lost all
my
    mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed
, it goes
so
    heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the
earth,
    seems to me 
a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy,
the
    air, look you, this brave o'erhanging fi
rmament, this
majestical
    roof fretted with golden fire- why, it appeareth no other
thing
   
 to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What
a
    piece of work is a man! how n
oble in reason! how infinite in
    faculties! in form and moving how express and admirable! in
  
  action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the
    beauty of the world, the parago
n of animals! And yet to me
what
    is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me- no, nor
w
oman
    neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.
  Ros. My lord, there was no such stu
ff in my thoughts.
  Ham. Why did you laugh then, when I said 'Man delights not me'?
  Ros. To thi
nk, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten
    entertainment the players shall receive fro
m you. We coted
them
    on the way, and hither are they coming to offer you service.
  Ham. He t
hat plays the king shall be welcome- his Majesty shall
    have tribute of me; the adventurous knig
ht shall use his foil
and
    target; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humorous man
shall
  
  end his part in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose
    lungs are tickle o' th' sere; a
nd the lady shall say her mind
    freely, or the blank verse shall halt for't. What players are
 
   they?
  Ros. Even those you were wont to take such delight in, the
    tragedians of the city.

  Ham. How chances it they travel? Their residence, both in
    reputation and profit, was better 
both ways.
  Ros. I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late
    innovation.
  Ham. 
Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in
the
    city? Are they so follow'd?
  Ros
. No indeed are they not.
  Ham. How comes it? Do they grow rusty?
  Ros. Nay, their endeavour kee
ps in the wonted pace; but there
is,
    sir, an eyrie of children, little eyases, that cry out on
 the
top
    of question and are most tyrannically clapp'd for't. These
are now
    the fashion,
 and so berattle the common stages (so they call
    them) that many wearing rapiers are afraid of 
goosequills and
    dare scarce come thither.
  Ham. What, are they children? Who maintains 'em? H
ow are they
    escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can
    sing? Will they 
not say afterwards, if they should grow
    themselves to common players (as it is most like, if th
eir
means
    are no better), their writers do them wrong to make them
exclaim
    against their
 own succession.
  Ros. Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the
nation
    holds 
it no sin to tarre them to controversy. There was, for
a
    while, no money bid for argument unle
ss the poet and the
player
    went to cuffs in the question.
  Ham. Is't possible?
  Guil. O, t
here has been much throwing about of brains.
  Ham. Do the boys carry it away?
  Ros. Ay, that the
y do, my lord- Hercules and his load too.
  Ham. It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of De
nmark,
and
    those that would make mows at him while my father lived give
    twenty, forty, fi
fty, a hundred ducats apiece for his picture
in
    little. 'Sblood, there is something in this mo
re than
natural, if
    philosophy could find it out.

                     Flourish for the Pla
yers.

  Guil. There are the players.
  Ham. Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, 
come!
Th'
    appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me
comply
    with you in thi
s garb, lest my extent to the players (which I
    tell you must show fairly outwards) should more 
appear like
    entertainment than yours. You are welcome. But my
uncle-father
    and aunt-mothe
r are deceiv'd.
  Guil. In what, my dear lord?
  Ham. I am but mad north-north-west. When the wind
 is southerly
I
    know a hawk from a handsaw.

                            Enter Polonius.


  Pol. Well be with you, gentlemen!
  Ham. Hark you, Guildenstern- and you too- at each ear a heare
r!
    That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling
    clouts.
  Ros. Happily h
e's the second time come to them; for they say an
old
    man is twice a child.
  Ham. I will pro
phesy he comes to tell me of the players. Mark
it.-
   You say right, sir; a Monday morning; twas 
so indeed.
  Pol. My lord, I have news to tell you.
  Ham. My lord, I have news to tell you. When 
Roscius was an
actor in
    Rome-
  Pol. The actors are come hither, my lord.
  Ham. Buzz, buzz!

  Pol. Upon my honour-
  Ham. Then came each actor on his ass-
  Pol. The best actors in the wor
ld, either for tragedy, comedy,
    history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral,
    
tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral;
scene
    individable, or poem unlimite
d. Seneca cannot be too heavy,
nor
    Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, the
se
are
    the only men.
  Ham. O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
  Pol. 
What treasure had he, my lord?
  Ham. Why,

         'One fair daughter, and no more,
          
 The which he loved passing well.'

  Pol. [aside] Still on my daughter.
  Ham. Am I not i' th' r
ight, old Jephthah?
  Pol. If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I
    love pas
sing well.
  Ham. Nay, that follows not.
  Pol. What follows then, my lord?
  Ham. Why,

      
     'As by lot, God wot,'

 and then, you know,

           'It came to pass, as most like it w
as.'

    The first row of the pious chanson will show you more; for
look
    where my abridgmen
t comes.

                     Enter four or five Players.

    You are welcome, masters; welcom
e, all.- I am glad to see
thee
    well.- Welcome, good friends.- O, my old friend? Why, thy
face
 is
    valanc'd since I saw thee last. Com'st' thou to' beard me in
    Denmark?- What, my young 
lady and mistress? By'r Lady, your
    ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last by the

    altitude of a chopine. Pray God your voice, like a piece of
    uncurrent gold, be not crack'
d within the ring.- Masters, you
are
    all welcome. We'll e'en to't like French falconers, fly a
t
    anything we see. We'll have a speech straight. Come, give us
a
    taste of your quality. C
ome, a passionate speech.
  1. Play. What speech, my good lord?
  Ham. I heard thee speak me a spe
ech once, but it was never
acted;
    or if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember,
ple
as'd
    not the million, 'twas caviary to the general; but it was (as
I
    receiv'd it, and oth
ers, whose judgments in such matters
cried in
    the top of mine) an excellent play, well digeste
d in the
scenes,
    set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember one said
    there were
 no sallets in the lines to make the matter
savoury,
    nor no matter in the phrase that might in
dict the author of
    affectation; but call'd it an honest method, as wholesome as
    sweet, and
 by very much more handsome than fine. One speech
in't
    I chiefly lov'd. 'Twas AEneas' tale to 
Dido, and thereabout
of it
    especially where he speaks of Priam's slaughter. If it live
in
  
  your memory, begin at this line- let me see, let me see:

         'The rugged Pyrrhus, like th'
 Hyrcanian beast-'

    'Tis not so; it begins with Pyrrhus:

         'The rugged Pyrrhus, he w
hose sable arms,
         Black as his purpose, did the night resemble
         When he lay couche
d in the ominous horse,
         Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd
         With he
raldry more dismal. Head to foot
         Now is be total gules, horridly trick'd
         With bl
ood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
         Bak'd and impasted with the parching streets,
 
        That lend a tyrannous and a damned light
         To their lord's murther. Roasted in wrath
 and fire,
         And thus o'ersized with coagulate gore,
         With eyes like carbuncles, th
e hellish Pyrrhus
         Old grandsire Priam seeks.'

    So, proceed you.
  Pol. Fore God, my
 lord, well spoken, with good accent and good
     discretion.

  1. Play. 'Anon he finds him,
 
     Striking too short at Greeks. His antique sword,
      Rebellious to his arm, lies where it fa
lls,
      Repugnant to command. Unequal match'd,
      Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes w
ide;
      But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
      Th' unnerved father falls. Then sen
seless Ilium,
      Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
      Stoops to his base, and with
 a hideous crash
      Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear. For lo! his sword,
      Which was declining o
n the milky head
      Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' th' air to stick.
      So, as a painted tyran
t, Pyrrhus stood,
      And, like a neutral to his will and matter,
      Did nothing.
      But,
 as we often see, against some storm,
      A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
      
The bold winds speechless, and the orb below
      As hush as death- anon the dreadful thunder
   
   Doth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
      Aroused vengeance sets him new awork;
   
   And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
      On Mars's armour, forg'd for proof eterne,
      
With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
      Now falls on Priam.
      Out, out, thou stru
mpet Fortune! All you gods,
      In general synod take away her power;
      Break all the spokes
 and fellies from her wheel,
      And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
      As low a
s to the fiends!

  Pol. This is too long.
  Ham. It shall to the barber's, with your beard.- Pri
thee say
on.
    He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps. Say on;
come to
    Hecuba.


  1. Play. 'But who, O who, had seen the mobled queen-'

  Ham. 'The mobled queen'?
  Pol. That
's good! 'Mobled queen' is good.

  1. Play. 'Run barefoot up and down, threat'ning the flames
  
    With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head
      Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
 
     About her lank and all o'erteemed loins,
      A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up-
   
   Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd
      'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have
 pronounc'd.
      But if the gods themselves did see her then,
      When she saw Pyrrhus make ma
licious sport
      In Mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,
      The instant burst of clam
our that she made
      (Unless things mortal move them not at all)
      Would have made milch th
e burning eyes of heaven
      And passion in the gods.'

  Pol. Look, whe'r he has not turn'd hi
s colour, and has tears
in's
    eyes. Prithee no more!
  Ham. 'Tis well. I'll have thee speak ou
t the rest of this
soon.-
    Good my lord, will you see the players well bestow'd? Do you
    he
ar? Let them be well us'd; for they are the abstract and
brief
    chronicles of the time. After y
our death you were better have
a
    bad epitaph than their ill report while you live.
  Pol. My 
lord, I will use them according to their desert.
  Ham. God's bodykins, man, much better! Use every
 man after his
    desert, and who should scape whipping? Use them after your
own
    honour and 
dignity. The less they deserve, the more merit is
in
    your bounty. Take them in.
  Pol. Come, 
sirs.
  Ham. Follow him, friends. We'll hear a play to-morrow.
                 Exeunt Polonius an
d Players [except the First].
    Dost thou hear me, old friend? Can you play 'The Murther of
    
Gonzago'?
  1. Play. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need, study 
a
    speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which I would set down
and
    insert in't, could you
 not?
  1. Play. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Very well. Follow that lord- and look you mock him not.
    
                                        [Exit First Player.]
    My good friends, I'll leave you ti
ll night. You are welcome
to
    Elsinore.
  Ros. Good my lord!
  Ham. Ay, so, God b' wi' ye!
 
                           [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
    Now I am alone.
    O what a r
ogue and peasant slave am I!
    Is it not monstrous that this player here,
    But in a fiction, 
in a dream of passion,
    Could force his soul so to his own conceit
    That, from her working, 
all his visage wann'd,
    Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
    A broken voice, and his
 whole function suiting
    With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!
    For Hecuba!
    W
hat's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
    That he should weep for her? What would he do,
    Had h
e the motive and the cue for passion
    That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
    And 
cleave the general ear with horrid speech;
    Make mad the guilty and appal the free,
    Confoun
d the ignorant, and amaze indeed
    The very faculties of eyes and ears.
    Yet I,
    A dull a
nd muddy-mettled rascal, peak
    Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
    And can say noth
ing! No, not for a king,
    Upon whose property and most dear life
    A damn'd defeat was made. 
Am I a coward?
    Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
    Plucks off my beard and blows 
it in my face?
    Tweaks me by th' nose? gives me the lie i' th' throat
    As deep as to the lun
gs? Who does me this, ha?
    'Swounds, I should take it! for it cannot be
    But I am pigeon-liv
er'd and lack gall
    To make oppression bitter, or ere this
    I should have fatted all the reg
ion kites
    With this slave's offal. Bloody bawdy villain!
    Remorseless, treacherous, lechero
us, kindless villain!
    O, vengeance!
    Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
    That I
, the son of a dear father murther'd,
    Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
    Must (lik
e a whore) unpack my heart with words
    And fall a-cursing like a very drab,
    A scullion!
  
  Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! Hum, I have heard
    That guilty creatures, sitting at a play,

    Have by the very cunning of the scene
    Been struck so to the soul that presently
    They
 have proclaim'd their malefactions;
    For murther, though it have no tongue, will speak
    Wit
h most miraculous organ, I'll have these Players
    Play something like the murther of my father

    Before mine uncle. I'll observe his looks;
    I'll tent him to the quick. If he but blench,
 
   I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
    May be a devil; and the devil hath power
    
T' assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
    Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
    As he i
s very potent with such spirits,
    Abuses me to damn me. I'll have grounds
    More relative tha
n this. The play's the thing
    Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King.         Exit.

ACT III. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King, Queen, Polonius, O
phelia, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern,
and Lords.

  King. And can you by no drift of circumstance
 
   Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
    Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
    Wi
th turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
  Ros. He does confess he feels himself distracted,
    But fro
m what cause he will by no means speak.
  Guil. Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
    But 
with a crafty madness keeps aloof
    When we would bring him on to some confession
    Of his tru
e state.
  Queen. Did he receive you well?
  Ros. Most like a gentleman.
  Guil. But with much fo
rcing of his disposition.
  Ros. Niggard of question, but of our demands
    Most free in his repl
y.
  Queen. Did you assay him
    To any pastime?
  Ros. Madam, it so fell out that certain playe
rs
    We o'erraught on the way. Of these we told him,
    And there did seem in him a kind of joy

    To hear of it. They are here about the court,
    And, as I think, they have already order
 
   This night to play before him.
  Pol. 'Tis most true;
    And he beseech'd me to entreat your M
ajesties
    To hear and see the matter.
  King. With all my heart, and it doth much content me
 
   To hear him so inclin'd.
    Good gentlemen, give him a further edge
    And drive his purpose 
on to these delights.
  Ros. We shall, my lord.
                            Exeunt Rosencrantz and
 Guildenstern.
  King. Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
    For we have closely sent for Hamlet hithe
r,
    That he, as 'twere by accident, may here
    Affront Ophelia.
    Her father and myself (l
awful espials)
    Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing unseen,
    We may of their encounter fra
nkly judge
    And gather by him, as he is behav'd,
    If't be th' affliction of his love, or no,

    That thus he suffers for.
  Queen. I shall obey you;
    And for your part, Ophelia, I do wi
sh
    That your good beauties be the happy cause
    Of Hamlet's wildness. So shall I hope your v
irtues
    Will bring him to his wonted way again,
    To both your honours.
  Oph. Madam, I wish
 it may.
                                                   [Exit Queen.]
  Pol. Ophelia, walk you
 here.- Gracious, so please you,
    We will bestow ourselves.- [To Ophelia] Read on this book,
  
  That show of such an exercise may colour
    Your loneliness.- We are oft to blame in this,
    
'Tis too much prov'd, that with devotion's visage
    And pious action we do sugar o'er
    The De
vil himself.
  King. [aside] O, 'tis too true!
    How smart a lash that speech doth give my consc
ience!
    The harlot's cheek, beautied with plast'ring art,
    Is not more ugly to the thing tha
t helps it
    Than is my deed to my most painted word.
    O heavy burthen!
  Pol. I hear him co
ming. Let's withdraw, my lord.
                                      Exeunt King and Polonius].


                           Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. To be, or not to be- that is the question:
    W
hether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
    The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
    Or to
 take arms against a sea of troubles,
    And by opposing end them. To die- to sleep-
    No more;
 and by a sleep to say we end
    The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks
    That flesh is
 heir to. 'Tis a consummation
    Devoutly to be wish'd. To die- to sleep.
    To sleep- perchance
 to dream: ay, there's the rub!
    For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
    When we ha
ve shuffled off this mortal coil,
    Must give us pause. There's the respect
    That makes calam
ity of so long life.
    For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
    Th' oppressor's wron
g, the proud man's contumely,
    The pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay,
    The insolence o
f office, and the spurns
    That patient merit of th' unworthy takes,
    When he himself might h
is quietus make
    With a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear,
    To grunt and sweat under
 a weary life,
    But that the dread of something after death-
    The undiscover'd country, from
 whose bourn
    No traveller returns- puzzles the will,
    And makes us rather bear those ills w
e have
    Than fly to others that we know not of?
    Thus conscience does make cowards of us all
,
    And thus the native hue of resolution
    Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
 
   And enterprises of great pith and moment
    With this regard their currents turn awry
    And 
lose the name of action.- Soft you now!
    The fair Ophelia!- Nymph, in thy orisons
    Be all my
 sins rememb'red.
  Oph. Good my lord,
    How does your honour for this many a day?
  Ham. I hum
bly thank you; well, well, well.
  Oph. My lord, I have remembrances of yours
    That I have long
ed long to re-deliver.
    I pray you, now receive them.
  Ham. No, not I!
    I never gave you a
ught.
  Oph. My honour'd lord, you know right well you did,
    And with them words of so sweet br
eath compos'd
    As made the things more rich. Their perfume lost,
    Take these again; for to t
he noble mind
    Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
    There, my lord.
  Ham. Ha, ha
! Are you honest?
  Oph. My lord?
  Ham. Are you fair?
  Oph. What means your lordship?
  Ham. T
hat if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit
no
    discourse to your beauty.
  Oph. 
Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with
honesty?
  Ham. Ay, truly; for the power of 
beauty will sooner transform
    honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty
can

    translate beauty into his likeness. This was sometime a
paradox,
    but now the time gives it
 proof. I did love you once.
  Oph. Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
  Ham. You should not
 have believ'd me; for virtue cannot so
    inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it. I lo
ved
you
    not.
  Oph. I was the more deceived.
  Ham. Get thee to a nunnery! Why wouldst thou 
be a breeder of
    sinners? I am myself indifferent honest, but yet I could
accuse
    me of suc
h things that it were better my mother had not borne
me.
    I am very proud, revengeful, ambitiou
s; with more offences at
my
    beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give
   
 them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows
as I
    do, crawling between earth 
and heaven? We are arrant knaves
all;
    believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where's yo
ur
    father?
  Oph. At home, my lord.
  Ham. Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play t
he fool
    nowhere but in's own house. Farewell.
  Oph. O, help him, you sweet heavens!
  Ham. I
f thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy
dowry:
    be thou as chaste as ice, as pure
 as snow, thou shalt not
escape
    calumny. Get thee to a nunnery. Go, farewell. Or if thou wilt

    needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what
    monsters you make of them. T
o a nunnery, go; and quickly too.
    Farewell.
  Oph. O heavenly powers, restore him!
  Ham. I h
ave heard of your paintings too, well enough. God hath
    given you one face, and you make yoursel
ves another. You jig,
you
    amble, and you lisp; you nickname God's creatures and make
your
  
  wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't! it hath
made
    me mad. I say, we will hav
e no more marriages. Those that are
    married already- all but one- shall live; the rest shall ke
ep
as
    they are. To a nunnery, go.                            Exit.
  Oph. O, what a noble min
d is here o'erthrown!
    The courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword,
    Th' expect
ancy and rose of the fair state,
    The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
    Th' observ'd 
of all observers- quite, quite down!
    And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
    That suck'
d the honey of his music vows,
    Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
    Like sweet be
lls jangled, out of tune and harsh;
    That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
    Blasted
 with ecstasy. O, woe is me
    T' have seen what I have seen, see what I see!

                 
  Enter King and Polonius.

  King. Love? his affections do not that way tend;
    Nor what he sp
ake, though it lack'd form a little,
    Was not like madness. There's something in his soul
    O
'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
    And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
    Will be 
some danger; which for to prevent,
    I have in quick determination
    Thus set it down: he shal
l with speed to England
    For the demand of our neglected tribute.
    Haply the seas, and count
ries different,
    With variable objects, shall expel
    This something-settled matter in his he
art,
    Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
    From fashion of himself. What think yo
u on't?
  Pol. It shall do well. But yet do I believe
    The origin and commencement of his grief

    Sprung from neglected love.- How now, Ophelia?
    You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said
.
    We heard it all.- My lord, do as you please;
    But if you hold it fit, after the play
   
 Let his queen mother all alone entreat him
    To show his grief. Let her be round with him;
    
And I'll be plac'd so please you, in the ear
    Of all their conference. If she find him not,
   
 To England send him; or confine him where
    Your wisdom best shall think.
  King. It shall be s
o.
    Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.         Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. h
all in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet and three of the Players.

  Ham. Speak the speech, I pray you,
 as I pronounc'd it to you,
    trippingly on the tongue. But if you mouth it, as many of our
    
players do, I had as live the town crier spoke my lines. Nor
do
    not saw the air too much with 
your hand, thus, but use all
    gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and (as I may say)
    
whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and beget a
    temperance that may give it smoothness.
 O, it offends me to
the
    soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion
to
  
  tatters, to very rags, to split the cars of the groundlings,
who
    (for the most part) are cap
able of nothing but inexplicable
dumb
    shows and noise. I would have such a fellow whipp'd for

o'erdoing
    Termagant. It out-herods Herod. Pray you avoid it.
  Player. I warrant your honour.

  Ham. Be not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be
your
    tutor. Suit the action t
o the word, the word to the action;
with
    this special observance, that you o'erstep not the mo
desty of
    nature: for anything so overdone is from the purpose of
playing,
    whose end, both
 at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as
    'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show Virtue 
her own
feature,
    scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time
his
    form and
 pressure. Now this overdone, or come tardy off,
though
    it make the unskilful laugh, cannot bu
t make the judicious
    grieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance
    o'erweigh
 a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that
I
    have seen play, and heard others praise
, and that highly (not
to
    speak it profanely), that, neither having the accent of
    Christi
ans, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have
so
    strutted and bellowed that I have thou
ght some of Nature's
    journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they
imitated
    human
ity so abominably.
  Player. I hope we have reform'd that indifferently with us,
sir.
  Ham. O, r
eform it altogether! And let those that play your
clowns
    speak no more than is set down for th
em. For there be of them
    that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren
    spe
ctators to laugh too, though in the mean time some
necessary
    question of the play be then to b
e considered. That's
villanous
    and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it.
Go

    make you ready.
                                                 Exeunt Players.

         
   Enter Polonius, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.

    How now, my lord? Will the King hear this p
iece of work?
  Pol. And the Queen too, and that presently.
  Ham. Bid the players make haste, [Ex
it Polonius.] Will you two
    help to hasten them?
  Both. We will, my lord.                     
  Exeunt they two.
  Ham. What, ho, Horatio!

                      Enter Horatio.

  Hor. Here
, sweet lord, at your service.
  Ham. Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
    As e'er my conversa
tion cop'd withal.
  Hor. O, my dear lord!
  Ham. Nay, do not think I flatter;
    For what advan
cement may I hope from thee,
    That no revenue hast but thy good spirits
    To feed and clothe 
thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
    No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
    And c
rook the pregnant hinges of the knee
    Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
    Sinc
e my dear soul was mistress of her choice
    And could of men distinguish, her election
    Hath 
seal'd thee for herself. For thou hast been
    As one, in suff'ring all, that suffers nothing;
  
  A man that Fortune's buffets and rewards
    Hast ta'en with equal thanks; and blest are those
 
   Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled
    That they are not a pipe for Fortune's finge
r
    To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
    That is not passion's slave, and I will 
wear him
    In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
    As I do thee. Something too much of
 this I
    There is a play to-night before the King.
    One scene of it comes near the circumsta
nce,
    Which I have told thee, of my father's death.
    I prithee, when thou seest that act afo
ot,
    Even with the very comment of thy soul
    Observe my uncle. If his occulted guilt
    Do
 not itself unkennel in one speech,
    It is a damned ghost that we have seen,
    And my imagina
tions are as foul
    As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
    For I mine eyes will rivet to
 his face,
    And after we will both our judgments join
    In censure of his seeming.
  Hor. We
ll, my lord.
    If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
    And scape detecting, I wil
l pay the theft.

    Sound a flourish. [Enter Trumpets and Kettledrums. Danish
    march. [Enter
 King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz,
      Guildenstern, and other Lords attendant, with t
he Guard
                       carrying torches.

  Ham. They are coming to the play. I must be 
idle.
    Get you a place.
  King. How fares our cousin Hamlet?
  Ham. Excellent, i' faith; of th
e chameleon's dish. I eat the
air,
    promise-cramm'd. You cannot feed capons so.
  King. I have
 nothing with this answer, Hamlet. These words are
not
    mine.
  Ham. No, nor mine now. [To Pol
onius] My lord, you play'd once
    i' th' university, you say?
  Pol. That did I, my lord, and wa
s accounted a good actor.
  Ham. What did you enact?
  Pol. I did enact Julius Caesar; I was kill'
d i' th' Capitol;
Brutus
    kill'd me.
  Ham. It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a ca
lf
there. Be
    the players ready.
  Ros. Ay, my lord. They stay upon your patience.
  Queen. C
ome hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
  Ham. No, good mother. Here's metal more attractive.
  Pol
. [to the King] O, ho! do you mark that?
  Ham. Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
                   
               [Sits down at Ophelia's feet.]

  Oph. No, my lord.
  Ham. I mean, my head upon yo
ur lap?
  Oph. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Do you think I meant country matters?
  Oph. I think nothing, 
my lord.
  Ham. That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
  Oph. What is, my lord?
  Ham.
 Nothing.
  Oph. You are merry, my lord.
  Ham. Who, I?
  Oph. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. O God, your o
nly jig-maker! What should a man do but be
merry?
    For look you how cheerfully my mother looks,
 and my father
died
    within 's two hours.
  Oph. Nay 'tis twice two months, my lord.
  Ham. S
o long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I'll have
a
    suit of sables. O heavens! die two
 months ago, and not
forgotten
    yet? Then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his
li
fe
    half a year. But, by'r Lady, he must build churches then; or
else
    shall he suffer not 
thinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose

    epitaph is 'For O, for O, the hobby-horse is forgot!
'

               Hautboys play. The dumb show enters.

    Enter a King and a Queen very loving
ly; the Queen embracing
    him and he her. She kneels, and makes show of protestation
    unto hi
m. He takes her up, and declines his head upon her
    neck. He lays him down upon a bank of flower
s. She, seeing
    him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his
    crown, kisses
 it, pours poison in the sleeper's ears, and
    leaves him. The Queen returns, finds the King dead
, and makes
    passionate action. The Poisoner with some three or four
Mutes,
    comes in again
, seem to condole with her. The dead body is
    carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with gi
fts; she
    seems harsh and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts
    his love.
             
                                            Exeunt.

  Oph. What means this, my lord?
  Ham. Marr
y, this is miching malhecho; it means mischief.
  Oph. Belike this show imports the argument of the
 play.

                      Enter Prologue.

  Ham. We shall know by this fellow. The players 
cannot keep
counsel;
    they'll tell all.
  Oph. Will he tell us what this show meant?
  Ham. A
y, or any show that you'll show him. Be not you asham'd
to
    show, he'll not shame to tell you w
hat it means.
  Oph. You are naught, you are naught! I'll mark the play.

    Pro. For us, and fo
r our tragedy,
      Here stooping to your clemency,
      We beg your hearing patiently.         
            [Exit.]

  Ham. Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
  Oph. 'Tis brief, my lord
.
  Ham. As woman's love.

              Enter [two Players as] King and Queen.

    King. Full
 thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round
      Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
  
    And thirty dozen moons with borrowed sheen
      About the world have times twelve thirties bee
n,
      Since love our hearts, and Hymen did our hands,
      Unite comutual in most sacred bands
.
    Queen. So many journeys may the sun and moon
      Make us again count o'er ere love be done
!
      But woe is me! you are so sick of late,
      So far from cheer and from your former state
.
      That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
      Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing mus
t;
      For women's fear and love holds quantity,
      In neither aught, or in extremity.
     
 Now what my love is, proof hath made you know;
      And as my love is siz'd, my fear is so.
    
  Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
      Where little fears grow great, great lov
e grows there.
    King. Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;
      My operant powers 
their functions leave to do.
      And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
      Honour'd, 
belov'd, and haply one as kind
      For husband shalt thou-
    Queen. O, confound the rest!
   
   Such love must needs be treason in my breast.
      When second husband let me be accurst!
    
  None wed the second but who killed the first.

  Ham. [aside] Wormwood, wormwood!

    Queen. 
The instances that second marriage move
      Are base respects of thrift, but none of love.
     
 A second time I kill my husband dead
      When second husband kisses me in bed.
    King. I do b
elieve you think what now you speak;
      But what we do determine oft we break.
      Purpose is
 but the slave to memory,
      Of violent birth, but poor validity;
      Which now, like fruit u
nripe, sticks on the tree,
      But fall unshaken when they mellow be.
      Most necessary 'tis 
that we forget
      To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt.
      What to ourselves in passio
n we propose,
      The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
      The violence of either grief 
or joy
      Their own enactures with themselves destroy.
      Where joy most revels, grief doth 
most lament;
      Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
      This world is not for aye, 
nor 'tis not strange
      That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
      For 'tis a q
uestion left us yet to prove,
      Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
      The gre
at man down, you mark his favourite flies,
      The poor advanc'd makes friends of enemies;
     
 And hitherto doth love on fortune tend,
      For who not needs shall never lack a friend,
      
And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
      Directly seasons him his enemy.
      But, orderly
 to end where I begun,
      Our wills and fates do so contrary run
      That our devices still a
re overthrown;
      Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own.
      So think thou wilt n
o second husband wed;
      But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
    Queen. Nor earth
 to me give food, nor heaven light,
      Sport and repose lock from me day and night,
      To de
speration turn my trust and hope,
      An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope,
      Each opposi
te that blanks the face of joy
      Meet what I would have well, and it destroy,
      Both here 
and hence pursue me lasting strife,
      If, once a widow, ever I be wife!

  Ham. If she should
 break it now!

    King. 'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile.
      My spirits grow d
ull, and fain I would beguile
      The tedious day with sleep.
    Queen. Sleep rock thy brain,

                                                    [He] sleeps.
      And never come mischance bet
ween us twain!
Exit.

  Ham. Madam, how like you this play?
  Queen. The lady doth protest too m
uch, methinks.
  Ham. O, but she'll keep her word.
  King. Have you heard the argument? Is there n
o offence in't?
  Ham. No, no! They do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i'
th'
    world.
  
King. What do you call the play?
  Ham. 'The Mousetrap.' Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the

    image of a murther done in Vienna. Gonzago is the duke's
name;
    his wife, Baptista. You sha
ll see anon. 'Tis a knavish piece
of
    work; but what o' that? Your Majesty, and we that have fr
ee
    souls, it touches us not. Let the gall'd jade winch; our
withers
    are unwrung.

     
                    Enter Lucianus.

    This is one Lucianus, nephew to the King.
  Oph. You are
 as good as a chorus, my lord.
  Ham. I could interpret between you and your love, if I could
see

    the puppets dallying.
  Oph. You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
  Ham. It would cost you a 
groaning to take off my edge.
  Oph. Still better, and worse.
  Ham. So you must take your husband
s.- Begin, murtherer. Pox,
leave
    thy damnable faces, and begin! Come, the croaking raven doth

    bellow for revenge.

    Luc. Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
     
 Confederate season, else no creature seeing;
      Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,

      With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,
      Thy natural magic and dire propert
y
      On wholesome life usurp immediately.
                                   Pours the poison i
n his ears.

  Ham. He poisons him i' th' garden for's estate. His name's
Gonzago.
    The story
 is extant, and written in very choice Italian. You
    shall see anon how the murtherer gets the l
ove of Gonzago's
wife.
  Oph. The King rises.
  Ham. What, frighted with false fire?
  Queen. Ho
w fares my lord?
  Pol. Give o'er the play.
  King. Give me some light! Away!
  All. Lights, ligh
ts, lights!
                              Exeunt all but Hamlet and Horatio.
  Ham.   Why, let the
 strucken deer go weep,
          The hart ungalled play;
         For some must watch, while some
 must sleep:
          Thus runs the world away.
    Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers
- if the rest of
my
    fortunes turn Turk with me-with two Provincial roses on my
raz'd
    sho
es, get me a fellowship in a cry of players, sir?
  Hor. Half a share.
  Ham.   A whole one I!
  
       For thou dost know, O Damon dear,
           This realm dismantled was
         Of Jove him
self; and now reigns here
           A very, very- pajock.
  Hor. You might have rhym'd.
  Ham. O
 good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand
    pound! Didst perceive?
  Hor. Very we
ll, my lord.
  Ham. Upon the talk of the poisoning?
  Hor. I did very well note him.
  Ham.   Aha
! Come, some music! Come, the recorders!
         For if the King like not the comedy,
         Wh
y then, belike he likes it not, perdy.
    Come, some music!

                Enter Rosencrantz a
nd Guildenstern.

  Guil. Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.
  Ham. Sir, a whole history
.
  Guil. The King, sir-
  Ham. Ay, sir, what of him?
  Guil. Is in his retirement, marvellous di
stemper'd.
  Ham. With drink, sir?
  Guil. No, my lord; rather with choler.
  Ham. Your wisdom sh
ould show itself more richer to signify this
to
    the doctor; for me to put him to his purgation
 would perhaps
    plunge him into far more choler.
  Guil. Good my lord, put your discourse into 
some frame, and
start
    not so wildly from my affair.
  Ham. I am tame, sir; pronounce.
  Guil
. The Queen, your mother, in most great affliction of
spirit
    hath sent me to you.
  Ham. You 
are welcome.
  Guil. Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right
breed.
    If it shall 
please you to make me a wholesome answer, I will
do
    your mother's commandment; if not, your pa
rdon and my return
    shall be the end of my business.
  Ham. Sir, I cannot.
  Guil. What, my lo
rd?
  Ham. Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseas'd. But, sir,
such
    answer as I can mak
e, you shall command; or rather, as you
say,
    my mother. Therefore no more, but to the matter! 
My mother,
you
    say-
  Ros. Then thus she says: your behaviour hath struck her into
    amaze
ment and admiration.
  Ham. O wonderful son, that can so stonish a mother! But is
there no
    se
quel at the heels of this mother's admiration? Impart.
  Ros. She desires to speak with you in her 
closet ere you go to
bed.
  Ham. We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any
    f
urther trade with us?
  Ros. My lord, you once did love me.
  Ham. And do still, by these pickers 
and stealers!
  Ros. Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? You do
surely
    bar the doo
r upon your own liberty, if you deny your griefs
to
    your friend.
  Ham. Sir, I lack advanceme
nt.
  Ros. How can that be, when you have the voice of the King
himself
    for your succession i
n Denmark?
  Ham. Ay, sir, but 'while the grass grows'- the proverb is
something
    musty.

  
                   Enter the Players with recorders.

    O, the recorders! Let me see one. To wit
hdraw with you- why
do
    you go about to recover the wind of me, as if you would drive
me
    
into a toil?
  Guil. O my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too
unmannerly.
  Ham. I do no
t well understand that. Will you play upon this
pipe?
  Guil. My lord, I cannot.
  Ham. I pray yo
u.
  Guil. Believe me, I cannot.
  Ham. I do beseech you.
  Guil. I know, no touch of it, my lord
.
  Ham. It is as easy as lying. Govern these ventages with your
    fingers and thumbs, give it b
reath with your mouth, and it
will
    discourse most eloquent music. Look you, these are the stop
s.
  Guil. But these cannot I command to any utt'rance of harmony. I
    have not the skill.
  Ha
m. Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me!
You
    would play upon me; you would s
eem to know my stops; you
would
    pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound me from my

    lowest note to the top of my compass; and there is much
music,
    excellent voice, in this l
ittle organ, yet cannot you make it
    speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am easier to be play'd on th
an
a
    pipe? Call me what instrument you will, though you can fret
me,
    you cannot play upo
n me.

                        Enter Polonius.

    God bless you, sir!
  Pol. My lord, the Que
en would speak with you, and presently.
  Ham. Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a 
camel?
  Pol. By th' mass, and 'tis like a camel indeed.
  Ham. Methinks it is like a weasel.
  P
ol. It is back'd like a weasel.
  Ham. Or like a whale.
  Pol. Very like a whale.
  Ham. Then wil
l I come to my mother by-and-by.- They fool me to
the
    top of my bent.- I will come by-and-by.

  Pol. I will say so.                                      Exit.
  Ham. 'By-and-by' is easily said
.- Leave me, friends.
                                        [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]

    'Tis 
now the very witching time of night,
    When churchyards yawn, and hell itself breathes out
    C
ontagion to this world. Now could I drink hot blood
    And do such bitter business as the day
   
 Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother!
    O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever
  
  The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom.
    Let me be cruel, not unnatural;
    I will speak dag
gers to her, but use none.
    My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites-
    How in my words somev
er she be shent,
    To give them seals never, my soul, consent!             Exit.




Scene I
II.
A room in the Castle.

Enter King, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.

  King. I like him not, 
nor stands it safe with us
    To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;
    I your commiss
ion will forthwith dispatch,
    And he to England shall along with you.
    The terms of our esta
te may not endure
    Hazard so near us as doth hourly grow
    Out of his lunacies.
  Guil. We w
ill ourselves provide.
    Most holy and religious fear it is
    To keep those many many bodies s
afe
    That live and feed upon your Majesty.
  Ros. The single and peculiar life is bound
    Wi
th all the strength and armour of the mind
    To keep itself from noyance; but much more
    That
 spirit upon whose weal depends and rests
    The lives of many. The cesse of majesty
    Dies not
 alone, but like a gulf doth draw
    What's near it with it. It is a massy wheel,
    Fix'd on th
e summit of the highest mount,
    To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
    Are mortis'
d and adjoin'd; which when it falls,
    Each small annexment, petty consequence,
    Attends the 
boist'rous ruin. Never alone
    Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.
  King. Arm you, I p
ray you, to this speedy voyage;
    For we will fetters put upon this fear,
    Which now goes too
 free-footed.
  Both. We will haste us.
                                               Exeunt Gent
lemen.

                   Enter Polonius.

  Pol. My lord, he's going to his mother's closet.

    Behind the arras I'll convey myself
    To hear the process. I'll warrant she'll tax him home;

    And, as you said, and wisely was it said,
    'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,

    Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear
    The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, m
y liege.
    I'll call upon you ere you go to bed
    And tell you what I know.
  King. Thanks, d
ear my lord.
                                                Exit [Polonius].
    O, my offence is
 rank, it smells to heaven;
    It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,
    A brother's murther! P
ray can I not,
    Though inclination be as sharp as will.
    My stronger guilt defeats my strong
 intent,
    And, like a man to double business bound,
    I stand in pause where I shall first be
gin,
    And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
    Were thicker than itself with brother's bl
ood,
    Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
    To wash it white as snow? Whereto serve
s mercy
    But to confront the visage of offence?
    And what's in prayer but this twofold force
,
    To be forestalled ere we come to fall,
    Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;
    M
y fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer
    Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murther'?

    That cannot be; since I am still possess'd
    Of those effects for which I did the murther-
 
   My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.
    May one be pardon'd and retain th' offence?
    
In the corrupted currents of this world
    Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,
    And of
t 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
    Buys out the law; but 'tis not so above.
    There is no s
huffling; there the action lies
    In his true nature, and we ourselves compell'd,
    Even to th
e teeth and forehead of our faults,
    To give in evidence. What then? What rests?
    Try what r
epentance can. What can it not?
    Yet what can it when one cannot repent?
    O wretched state! 
O bosom black as death!
    O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
    Art more engag'd! Help,
 angels! Make assay.
    Bow, stubborn knees; and heart with strings of steel,
    Be soft as sine
ws of the new-born babe!
    All may be well.                                  He kneels.

      
                   Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
    And now I'
ll do't. And so he goes to heaven,
    And so am I reveng'd. That would be scann'd.
    A villain 
kills my father; and for that,
    I, his sole son, do this same villain send
    To heaven.
    
Why, this is hire and salary, not revenge!
    He took my father grossly, full of bread,
    With 
all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
    And how his audit stands, who knows save heaven?

    But in our circumstance and course of thought,
    'Tis heavy with him; and am I then reveng'd,

    To take him in the purging of his soul,
    When he is fit and seasoned for his passage?
   
 No.
    Up, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent.
    When he is drunk asleep; or in his rage;

    Or in th' incestuous pleasure of his bed;
    At gaming, swearing, or about some act
    Tha
t has no relish of salvation in't-
    Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,
    And t
hat his soul may be as damn'd and black
    As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays.
    This ph
ysic but prolongs thy sickly days.              Exit.
  King. [rises] My words fly up, my thoughts 
remain below.
    Words without thoughts never to heaven go.             Exit.




Scene IV.

The Queen's closet.

Enter Queen and Polonius.

  Pol. He will come straight. Look you lay home 
to him.
    Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,
    And that your Grace hath scr
een'd and stood between
    Much heat and him. I'll silence me even here.
    Pray you be round wi
th him.
  Ham. (within) Mother, mother, mother!
  Queen. I'll warrant you; fear me not. Withdraw; 
I hear him
coming.
                              [Polonius hides behind the arras.]

           
               Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Now, mother, what's the matter?
  Queen. Hamlet, thou hast t
hy father much offended.
  Ham. Mother, you have my father much offended.
  Queen. Come, come, you
 answer with an idle tongue.
  Ham. Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
  Queen. Why, how n
ow, Hamlet?
  Ham. What's the matter now?
  Queen. Have you forgot me?
  Ham. No, by the rood, no
t so!
    You are the Queen, your husband's brother's wife,
    And (would it were not so!) you ar
e my mother.
  Queen. Nay, then I'll set those to you that can speak.
  Ham. Come, come, and sit y
ou down. You shall not budge;
    You go not till I set you up a glass
    Where you may see the i
nmost part of you.
  Queen. What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murther me?
    Help, help, ho!
  Po
l. [behind] What, ho! help, help, help!
  Ham. [draws] How now? a rat? Dead for a ducat, dead!
   
         [Makes a pass through the arras and] kills Polonius.
  Pol. [behind] O, I am slain!
  Que
en. O me, what hast thou done?
  Ham. Nay, I know not. Is it the King?
  Queen. O, what a rash and
 bloody deed is this!
  Ham. A bloody deed- almost as bad, good mother,
    As kill a king, and ma
rry with his brother.
  Queen. As kill a king?
  Ham. Ay, lady, it was my word.
                 
        [Lifts up the arras and sees Polonius.]
    Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!

    I took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune.
    Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.

    Leave wringing of your hands. Peace! sit you down
    And let me wring your heart; for so I sh
all
    If it be made of penetrable stuff;
    If damned custom have not braz'd it so
    That it
 is proof and bulwark against sense.
  Queen. What have I done that thou dar'st wag thy tongue
   
 In noise so rude against me?
  Ham. Such an act
    That blurs the grace and blush of modesty;
 
   Calls virtue hypocrite; takes off the rose
    From the fair forehead of an innocent love,
    
And sets a blister there; makes marriage vows
    As false as dicers' oaths. O, such a deed
    As
 from the body of contraction plucks
    The very soul, and sweet religion makes
    A rhapsody of
 words! Heaven's face doth glow;
    Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
    With tristful visag
e, as against the doom,
    Is thought-sick at the act.
  Queen. Ah me, what act,
    That roars 
so loud and thunders in the index?
  Ham. Look here upon th's picture, and on this,
    The counte
rfeit presentment of two brothers.
    See what a grace was seated on this brow;
    Hyperion's cu
rls; the front of Jove himself;
    An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
    A station like 
the herald Mercury
    New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill:
    A combination and a form indeed

    Where every god did seem to set his seal
    To give the world assurance of a man.
    This wa
s your husband. Look you now what follows.
    Here is your husband, like a mildew'd ear
    Blast
ing his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
    Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
    A
nd batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes
    You cannot call it love; for at your age
    The hey
day in the blood is tame, it's humble,
    And waits upon the judgment; and what judgment
    Woul
d step from this to this? Sense sure you have,
    Else could you not have motion; but sure that se
nse
    Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,
    Nor sense to ecstacy was ne'er so thrall'd
 
   But it reserv'd some quantity of choice
    To serve in such a difference. What devil was't
   
 That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
    Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
   
 Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
    Or but a sickly part of one true sense
    Cou
ld not so mope.
    O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
    If thou canst mutine in a ma
tron's bones,
    To flaming youth let virtue be as wax
    And melt in her own fire. Proclaim no 
shame
    When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
    Since frost itself as actively doth bur
n,
    And reason panders will.
  Queen. O Hamlet, speak no more!
    Thou turn'st mine eyes into
 my very soul,
    And there I see such black and grained spots
    As will not leave their tinct.

  Ham. Nay, but to live
    In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
    Stew'd in corruption, hone
ying and making love
    Over the nasty sty!
  Queen. O, speak to me no more!
    These words lik
e daggers enter in mine ears.
    No more, sweet Hamlet!
  Ham. A murtherer and a villain!
    A 
slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
    Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
    A cutp
urse of the empire and the rule,
    That from a shelf the precious diadem stole
    And put it in
 his pocket!
  Queen. No more!

                Enter the Ghost in his nightgown.

  Ham. A kin
g of shreds and patches!-
    Save me and hover o'er me with your wings,
    You heavenly guards! 
What would your gracious figure?
  Queen. Alas, he's mad!
  Ham. Do you not come your tardy son to
 chide,
    That, laps'd in time and passion, lets go by
    Th' important acting of your dread co
mmand?
    O, say!
  Ghost. Do not forget. This visitation
    Is but to whet thy almost blunted 
purpose.
    But look, amazement on thy mother sits.
    O, step between her and her fighting soul

    Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works.
    Speak to her, Hamlet.
  Ham. How is it with y
ou, lady?
  Queen. Alas, how is't with you,
    That you do bend your eye on vacancy,
    And wit
h th' encorporal air do hold discourse?
    Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
    And, 
as the sleeping soldiers in th' alarm,
    Your bedded hairs, like life in excrements,
    Start u
p and stand an end. O gentle son,
    Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
    Sprinkle cool p
atience! Whereon do you look?
  Ham. On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!
    His form and
 cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
    Would make them capable.- Do not look upon me,
    Lest
 with this piteous action you convert
    My stern effects. Then what I have to do
    Will want t
rue colour- tears perchance for blood.
  Queen. To whom do you speak this?
  Ham. Do you see nothi
ng there?
  Queen. Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
  Ham. Nor did you nothing hear?
  Quee
n. No, nothing but ourselves.
  Ham. Why, look you there! Look how it steals away!
    My father, 
in his habit as he liv'd!
    Look where he goes even now out at the portal!
                     
                                Exit Ghost.
  Queen. This is the very coinage of your brain.
    T
his bodiless creation ecstasy
    Is very cunning in.
  Ham. Ecstasy?
    My pulse as yours doth 
temperately keep time
    And makes as healthful music. It is not madness
    That I have utt'red.
 Bring me to the test,
    And I the matter will reword; which madness
    Would gambol from. Moth
er, for love of grace,
    Lay not that flattering unction to your soul
    That not your trespass
 but my madness speaks.
    It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
    Whiles rank corrupti
on, mining all within,
    Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
    Repent what's past; avo
id what is to come;
    And do not spread the compost on the weeds
    To make them ranker. Forgiv
e me this my virtue;
    For in the fatness of these pursy times
    Virtue itself of vice must pa
rdon beg-
    Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.
  Queen. O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my he
art in twain.
  Ham. O, throw away the worser part of it,
    And live the purer with the other ha
lf,
    Good night- but go not to my uncle's bed.
    Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
    Th
at monster, custom, who all sense doth eat
    Of habits evil, is angel yet in this,
    That to t
he use of actions fair and good
    He likewise gives a frock or livery,
    That aptly is put on.
 Refrain to-night,
    And that shall lend a kind of easiness
    To the next abstinence; the next
 more easy;
    For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
    And either [master] the devil, 
or throw him out
    With wondrous potency. Once more, good night;
    And when you are desirous t
o be blest,
    I'll blessing beg of you.- For this same lord,
    I do repent; but heaven hath pl
eas'd it so,
    To punish me with this, and this with me,
    That I must be their scourge and mi
nister.
    I will bestow him, and will answer well
    The death I gave him. So again, good night
.
    I must be cruel, only to be kind;
    Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.
    One wo
rd more, good lady.
  Queen. What shall I do?
  Ham. Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
  
  Let the bloat King tempt you again to bed;
    Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
 
   And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
    Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,

    Make you to ravel all this matter out,
    That I essentially am not in madness,
    But mad 
in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;
    For who that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
    Wou
ld from a paddock, from a bat, a gib
    Such dear concernings hide? Who would do so?
    No, in d
espite of sense and secrecy,
    Unpeg the basket on the house's top,
    Let the birds fly, and l
ike the famous ape,
    To try conclusions, in the basket creep
    And break your own neck down.

  Queen. Be thou assur'd, if words be made of breath,
    And breath of life, I have no life to br
eathe
    What thou hast said to me.
  Ham. I must to England; you know that?
  Queen. Alack,
  
  I had forgot! 'Tis so concluded on.
  Ham. There's letters seal'd; and my two schoolfellows,
   
 Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,
    They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way
    
And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
    For 'tis the sport to have the enginer
    Hoist with 
his own petar; and 't shall go hard
    But I will delve one yard below their mines
    And blow t
hem at the moon. O, 'tis most sweet
    When in one line two crafts directly meet.
    This man sh
all set me packing.
    I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.-
    Mother, good night.- Indee
d, this counsellor
    Is now most still, most secret, and most grave,
    Who was in life a fooli
sh peating knave.
    Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.
    Good night, mother.
        
          [Exit the Queen. Then] Exit Hamlet, tugging in
                                          
             Polonius.

ACT IV. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Ent
er King and Queen, with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  King. There's matter in these sighs. Thes
e profound heaves
    You must translate; 'tis fit we understand them.
    Where is your son?
  Q
ueen. Bestow this place on us a little while.
                          [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Gui
ldenstern.]
    Ah, mine own lord, what have I seen to-night!
  King. What, Gertrude? How does Ham
let?
  Queen. Mad as the sea and wind when both contend
    Which is the mightier. In his lawless 
fit
    Behind the arras hearing something stir,
    Whips out his rapier, cries 'A rat, a rat!'

    And in this brainish apprehension kills
    The unseen good old man.
  King. O heavy deed!
  
  It had been so with us, had we been there.
    His liberty is full of threats to all-
    To you
 yourself, to us, to every one.
    Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
    It will be l
aid to us, whose providence
    Should have kept short, restrain'd, and out of haunt
    This mad 
young man. But so much was our love
    We would not understand what was most fit,
    But, like t
he owner of a foul disease,
    To keep it from divulging, let it feed
    Even on the pith of lif
e. Where is he gone?
  Queen. To draw apart the body he hath kill'd;
    O'er whom his very madnes
s, like some ore
    Among a mineral of metals base,
    Shows itself pure. He weeps for what is d
one.
  King. O Gertrude, come away!
    The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch
    But we wi
ll ship him hence; and this vile deed
    We must with all our majesty and skill
    Both countena
nce and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!

             Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

    Friends
 both, go join you with some further aid.
    Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
    And from 
his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him.
    Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body
    I
nto the chapel. I pray you haste in this.
                          Exeunt [Rosencrantz and Guilden
stern].
    Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends
    And let them know both what we me
an to do
    And what's untimely done. [So haply slander-]
    Whose whisper o'er the world's diam
eter,
    As level as the cannon to his blank,
    Transports his poisoned shot- may miss our name

    And hit the woundless air.- O, come away!
    My soul is full of discord and dismay.
       
                                                  Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A passage in
 the Castle.

Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Safely stow'd.
  Gentlemen. (within) Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!

  Ham. But soft! What noise? Who calls on Hamlet? O, here they
come.

               Enter Rosenc
rantz and Guildenstern.

  Ros. What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
  Ham. Compounde
d it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
  Ros. Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
    And be
ar it to the chapel.
  Ham. Do not believe it.
  Ros. Believe what?
  Ham. That I can keep your c
ounsel, and not mine own. Besides,
to be
    demanded of a sponge, what replication should be made
 by the
son
    of a king?
  Ros. Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
  Ham. Ay, sir; that soaks 
up the King's countenance, his
rewards,
    his authorities. But such officers do the King best se
rvice
in
    the end. He keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his
jaw;
    first mouth'd, t
o be last swallowed. When he needs what you
have
    glean'd, it is but squeezing you and, sponge,
 you shall be
dry
    again.
  Ros. I understand you not, my lord.
  Ham. I am glad of it. A kna
vish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.
  Ros. My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with
 us
to
    the King.
  Ham. The body is with the King, but the King is not with the
body.
    T
he King is a thing-
  Guil. A thing, my lord?
  Ham. Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and al
l after.
                                                         Exeunt.




Scene III.
Elsi
nore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King.

  King. I have sent to seek him and to find the body.

    How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
    Yet must not we put the strong law on him.

    He's lov'd of the distracted multitude,
    Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;
  
  And where 'tis so, th' offender's scourge is weigh'd,
    But never the offence. To bear all smoo
th and even,
    This sudden sending him away must seem
    Deliberate pause. Diseases desperate g
rown
    By desperate appliance are reliev'd,
    Or not at all.

                    Enter Rose
ncrantz.

    How now O What hath befall'n?
  Ros. Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
   
 We cannot get from him.
  King. But where is he?
  Ros. Without, my lord; guarded, to know your p
leasure.
  King. Bring him before us.
  Ros. Ho, Guildenstern! Bring in my lord.

        Enter 
Hamlet and Guildenstern [with Attendants].

  King. Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
  Ham. At supp
er.
  King. At supper? Where?
  Ham. Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A certain
    conv
ocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your worm is
your
    only emperor for diet. We fat all 
creatures else to fat us,
and
    we fat ourselves for maggots. Your fat king and your lean
begga
r
    is but variable service- two dishes, but to one table. That's
the
    end.
  King. Alas, a
las!
  Ham. A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and
eat
    of the fish that ha
th fed of that worm.
  King. What dost thou mean by this?
  Ham. Nothing but to show you how a kin
g may go a progress
through
    the guts of a beggar.
  King. Where is Polonius?
  Ham. In heave
n. Send thither to see. If your messenger find him
not
    there, seek him i' th' other place your
self. But indeed, if
you
    find him not within this month, you shall nose him as you go
up
   
 the stair, into the lobby.
  King. Go seek him there. [To Attendants.]
  Ham. He will stay till y
ou come.
                                            [Exeunt Attendants.]
  King. Hamlet, this dee
d, for thine especial safety,-
    Which we do tender as we dearly grieve
    For that which thou 
hast done,- must send thee hence
    With fiery quickness. Therefore prepare thyself.
    The bark
 is ready and the wind at help,
    Th' associates tend, and everything is bent
    For England.

  Ham. For England?
  King. Ay, Hamlet.
  Ham. Good.
  King. So is it, if thou knew'st our purpos
es.
  Ham. I see a cherub that sees them. But come, for England!
    Farewell, dear mother.
  Kin
g. Thy loving father, Hamlet.
  Ham. My mother! Father and mother is man and wife; man and wife
is

    one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England!
Exit.
  King. Follow him at foot; tempt him
 with speed aboard.
    Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night.
    Away! for everything is se
al'd and done
    That else leans on th' affair. Pray you make haste.
                            
Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]
    And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught,-
    As m
y great power thereof may give thee sense,
    Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
    After
 the Danish sword, and thy free awe
    Pays homage to us,- thou mayst not coldly set
    Our sove
reign process, which imports at full,
    By letters congruing to that effect,
    The present dea
th of Hamlet. Do it, England;
    For like the hectic in my blood he rages,
    And thou must cure
 me. Till I know 'tis done,
    Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.             Exit.

Scene IV.
Near Elsinore.

Enter Fortinbras with his Army over the stage.

  For.
 Go, Captain, from me greet the Danish king.
    Tell him that by his license Fortinbras
    Crave
s the conveyance of a promis'd march
    Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.
    If that hi
s Majesty would aught with us,
    We shall express our duty in his eye;
    And let him know so.

  Capt. I will do't, my lord.
  For. Go softly on.
                                   Exeunt [all
 but the Captain].

       Enter Hamlet, Rosencrantz, [Guildenstern,] and others.

  Ham. Good s
ir, whose powers are these?
  Capt. They are of Norway, sir.
  Ham. How purpos'd, sir, I pray you?

  Capt. Against some part of Poland.
  Ham. Who commands them, sir?
  Capt. The nephew to old No
rway, Fortinbras.
  Ham. Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
    Or for some frontier?
  Cap
t. Truly to speak, and with no addition,
    We go to gain a little patch of ground
    That hath 
in it no profit but the name.
    To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
    Nor will it y
ield to Norway or the Pole
    A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
  Ham. Why, then the Polac
k never will defend it.
  Capt. Yes, it is already garrison'd.
  Ham. Two thousand souls and twent
y thousand ducats
    Will not debate the question of this straw.
    This is th' imposthume of mu
ch wealth and peace,
    That inward breaks, and shows no cause without
    Why the man dies.- I h
umbly thank you, sir.
  Capt. God b' wi' you, sir.                             [Exit.]
  Ros. Will
't please you go, my lord?
  Ham. I'll be with you straight. Go a little before.
                 
                       [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]
    How all occasions do inform against me
    And
 spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
    If his chief good and market of his time
    Be but to s
leep and feed? A beast, no more.
    Sure he that made us with such large discourse,
    Looking b
efore and after, gave us not
    That capability and godlike reason
    To fust in us unus'd. Now,
 whether it be
    Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple
    Of thinking too precisely on th' e
vent,-
    A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
    And ever three parts coward,- 
I do not know
    Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do,'
    Sith I have cause, and will, and
 strength, and means
    To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me.
    Witness this army of such
 mass and charge,
    Led by a delicate and tender prince,
    Whose spirit, with divine ambition 
puff'd,
    Makes mouths at the invisible event,
    Exposing what is mortal and unsure
    To al
l that fortune, death, and danger dare,
    Even for an eggshell. Rightly to be great
    Is not t
o stir without great argument,
    But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
    When honour's at the
 stake. How stand I then,
    That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,
    Excitements of my r
eason and my blood,
    And let all sleep, while to my shame I see
    The imminent death of twent
y thousand men
    That for a fantasy and trick of fame
    Go to their graves like beds, fight fo
r a plot
    Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
    Which is not tomb enough and continent

    To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,
    My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!   
         Exit.

Scene V.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter Horatio, Quee
n, and a Gentleman.

  Queen. I will not speak with her.
  Gent. She is importunate, indeed distr
act.
    Her mood will needs be pitied.
  Queen. What would she have?
  Gent. She speaks much of 
her father; says she hears
    There's tricks i' th' world, and hems, and beats her heart;
    Spu
rns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,
    That carry but half sense. Her speech is nothi
ng,
    Yet the unshaped use of it doth move
    The hearers to collection; they aim at it,
    A
nd botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;
    Which, as her winks and nods and gestures yiel
d them,
    Indeed would make one think there might be thought,
    Though nothing sure, yet much 
unhappily.
  Hor. 'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew
    Dangerous conjectures in
 ill-breeding minds.
  Queen. Let her come in.
                                               [Exi
t Gentleman.]
    [Aside] To my sick soul (as sin's true nature is)
    Each toy seems Prologue to
 some great amiss.
    So full of artless jealousy is guilt
    It spills itself in fearing to be 
spilt.

                 Enter Ophelia distracted.

  Oph. Where is the beauteous Majesty of Den
mark?
  Queen. How now, Ophelia?
  Oph. (sings)
         How should I your true-love know
      
     From another one?
         By his cockle bat and' staff
           And his sandal shoon.

 
 Queen. Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
  Oph. Say you? Nay, pray You mark.

    (Sings
) He is dead and gone, lady,
              He is dead and gone;
            At his head a grass-gr
een turf,
              At his heels a stone.

    O, ho!
  Queen. Nay, but Ophelia-
  Oph. Pra
y you mark.

    (Sings) White his shroud as the mountain snow-

                    Enter King.


  Queen. Alas, look here, my lord!
  Oph. (Sings)
           Larded all with sweet flowers;
 
        Which bewept to the grave did not go
           With true-love showers.

  King. How do y
ou, pretty lady?
  Oph. Well, God dild you! They say the owl was a baker's
daughter.
    Lord, we
 know what we are, but know not what we may be. God
be at
    your table!
  King. Conceit upon he
r father.
  Oph. Pray let's have no words of this; but when they ask, you
what
    it means, say 
you this:

    (Sings) To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,
              All in the morning bedti
me,
            And I a maid at your window,
              To be your Valentine.

            Th
en up he rose and donn'd his clo'es
              And dupp'd the chamber door,
            Let in 
the maid, that out a maid
              Never departed more.

  King. Pretty Ophelia!
  Oph. Ind
eed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't!

    [Sings] By Gis and by Saint Charity,
      
        Alack, and fie for shame!
            Young men will do't if they come to't
              
By Cock, they are to blame.

            Quoth she, 'Before you tumbled me,
              You pro
mis'd me to wed.'

    He answers:

            'So would I 'a' done, by yonder sun,
          
    An thou hadst not come to my bed.'

  King. How long hath she been thus?
  Oph. I hope all wi
ll be well. We must be patient; but I cannot
    choose but weep to think they would lay him i' th'
 cold
ground.
    My brother shall know of it; and so I thank you for your good
    counsel. Come
, my coach! Good night, ladies. Good night,
sweet
    ladies. Good night, good night.             
            Exit
  King. Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.
                      
                           [Exit Horatio.]

    O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs
 
   All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
    When sorrows come, they come not single s
pies.
    But in battalions! First, her father slain;
    Next, your son gone, and he most violent
 author
    Of his own just remove; the people muddied,
    Thick and and unwholesome in their tho
ughts and whispers
    For good Polonius' death, and we have done but greenly
    In hugger-mugger
 to inter him; poor Ophelia
    Divided from herself and her fair judgment,
    Without the which 
we are pictures or mere beasts;
    Last, and as much containing as all these,
    Her brother is 
in secret come from France;
    And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
    Feeds on his wonder, k
eep, himself in clouds,
    With pestilent speeches of his father's death,
    Wherein necessity, 
of matter beggar'd,
    Will nothing stick our person to arraign
    In ear and ear. O my dear Ger
trude, this,
    Like to a murd'ring piece, in many places
    Give me superfluous death.         
         A noise within.
  Queen. Alack, what noise is this?
  King. Where are my Switzers? Let th
em guard the door.

                     Enter a Messenger.

    What is the matter?
  Mess. Sa
ve Yourself, my lord:
    The ocean, overpeering of his list,
    Eats not the flats with more imp
etuous haste
    Than Young Laertes, in a riotous head,
    O'erbears Your offices. The rabble cal
l him lord;
    And, as the world were now but to begin,
    Antiquity forgot, custom not known,

    The ratifiers and props of every word,
    They cry 'Choose we! Laertes shall be king!'
    Ca
ps, hands, and tongues applaud it to the clouds,
    'Laertes shall be king! Laertes king!'
      
                                           A noise within.
  Queen. How cheerfully on the false tra
il they cry!
    O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!
  King. The doors are broke.

      
              Enter Laertes with others.

  Laer. Where is this king?- Sirs, staid you all without
.
  All. No, let's come in!
  Laer. I pray you give me leave.
  All. We will, we will!
  Laer. I
 thank you. Keep the door.      [Exeunt his Followers.]
    O thou vile king,
    Give me my fathe
r!
  Queen. Calmly, good Laertes.
  Laer. That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard;
  
  Cries cuckold to my father; brands the harlot
    Even here between the chaste unsmirched brows

    Of my true mother.
  King. What is the cause, Laertes,
    That thy rebellion looks so giantli
ke?
    Let him go, Gertrude. Do not fear our person.
    There's such divinity doth hedge a king

    That treason can but peep to what it would,
    Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,
  
  Why thou art thus incens'd. Let him go, Gertrude.
    Speak, man.
  Laer. Where is my father?
 
 King. Dead.
  Queen. But not by him!
  King. Let him demand his fill.
  Laer. How came he dead? 
I'll not be juggled with:
    To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil
    Conscience and 
grace, to the profoundest pit!
    I dare damnation. To this point I stand,
    That both the worl
d, I give to negligence,
    Let come what comes; only I'll be reveng'd
    Most throughly for my 
father.
  King. Who shall stay you?
  Laer. My will, not all the world!
    And for my means, I'l
l husband them so well
    They shall go far with little.
  King. Good Laertes,
    If you desire
 to know the certainty
    Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge
    That sweepst
ake you will draw both friend and foe,
    Winner and loser?
  Laer. None but his enemies.
  King
. Will you know them then?
  Laer. To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms
    And, like th
e kind life-rend'ring pelican,
    Repast them with my blood.
  King. Why, now You speak
    Like
 a good child and a true gentleman.
    That I am guiltless of your father's death,
    And am mos
t sensibly in grief for it,
    It shall as level to your judgment pierce
    As day does to your 
eye.
                              A noise within: 'Let her come in.'
  Laer. How now? What noise 
is that?

                      Enter Ophelia.

    O heat, dry up my brains! Tears seven times 
salt
    Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!
    By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by we
ight
    Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!
    Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!

    O heavens! is't possible a young maid's wits
    Should be as mortal as an old man's life?
   
 Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,
    It sends some precious instance of itself
    Af
ter the thing it loves.

  Oph. (sings)
         They bore him barefac'd on the bier
           
(Hey non nony, nony, hey nony)
         And in his grave rain'd many a tear.

    Fare you well, 
my dove!
  Laer. Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
    It could not move thus.
  O
ph. You must sing 'A-down a-down, and you call him a-down-a.'
O,
    how the wheel becomes it! It 
is the false steward, that stole
his
    master's daughter.
  Laer. This nothing's more than matt
er.
  Oph. There's rosemary, that's for remembrance. Pray you, love,
    remember. And there is pa
nsies, that's for thoughts.
  Laer. A document in madness! Thoughts and remembrance fitted.
  Oph.
 There's fennel for you, and columbines. There's rue for
you,
    and here's some for me. We may c
all it herb of grace o'
Sundays.
    O, you must wear your rue with a difference! There's a daisy.

I
    would give you some violets, but they wither'd all when my
father
    died. They say he m
ade a good end.

    [Sings] For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.

  Laer. Thought and afflictio
n, passion, hell itself,
    She turns to favour and to prettiness.
  Oph. (sings)
         And w
ill he not come again?
         And will he not come again?
           No, no, he is dead;
      
     Go to thy deathbed;
         He never will come again.

         His beard was as white as s
now,
         All flaxen was his poll.
           He is gone, he is gone,
           And we cast 
away moan.
         God 'a'mercy on his soul!

    And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God b'
 wi' you.
Exit.
  Laer. Do you see this, O God?
  King. Laertes, I must commune with your grief,

    Or you deny me right. Go but apart,
    Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will,
   
 And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me.
    If by direct or by collateral hand
    They 
find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,
    Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours,
   
 To you in satisfaction; but if not,
    Be you content to lend your patience to us,
    And we sh
all jointly labour with your soul
    To give it due content.
  Laer. Let this be so.
    His mea
ns of death, his obscure funeral-
    No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,
    No noble
 rite nor formal ostentation,-
    Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
    That I mus
t call't in question.
  King. So you shall;
    And where th' offence is let the great axe fall.

    I pray you go with me.
                                                          Exeunt

Scene VI.
Elsinore. Another room in the Castle.

Enter Horatio with an Attendant.


  Hor. What are they that would speak with me?
  Servant. Seafaring men, sir. They say they have 
letters for
you.
  Hor. Let them come in.
                                               [Exit At
tendant.]
    I do not know from what part of the world
    I should be greeted, if not from Lord 
Hamlet.

                          Enter Sailors.

  Sailor. God bless you, sir.
  Hor. Let him
 bless thee too.
  Sailor. 'A shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter for
you,
    sir,- it
 comes from th' ambassador that was bound for
England- if
    your name be Horatio, as I am let to
 know it is.
  Hor. (reads the letter) 'Horatio, when thou shalt have
overlook'd
    this, give t

    letters for him. Ere we were two days old at sea
, a pirate of

    very warlike appointment gave us chase. Finding ourselves too
    slow of sail

grapple I
    boarded them. On the instant they got cle
ar of our ship; so I
    alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with me like
thieves

    them. Let the King have the le

thou
    to me with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death. I have

Scene VII.
Elsinore. Another room in the Castle.

Enter 
King and Laertes.

  King. Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
    And You must put me 
in your heart for friend,
    Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
    That he which hath 
your noble father slain
    Pursued my life.
  Laer. It well appears. But tell me
    Why you pro
ceeded not against these feats
    So crimeful and so capital in nature,
    As by your safety, wi
sdom, all things else,
    You mainly were stirr'd up.
  King. O, for two special reasons,
    Wh
ich may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,
    But yet to me they are strong. The Queen his moth
er
    Lives almost by his looks; and for myself,-
    My virtue or my plague, be it either which,
-
    She's so conjunctive to my life and soul
    That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,

    I could not but by her. The other motive
    Why to a public count I might not go
    Is the 
great love the general gender bear him,
    Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
    Wo
uld, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
    Convert his gives to graces; so that my arrows
,
    Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,
    Would have reverted to my bow again,
    And 
not where I had aim'd them.
  Laer. And so have I a noble father lost;
    A sister driven into de
sp'rate terms,
    Whose worth, if praises may go back again,
    Stood challenger on mount of all
 the age
    For her perfections. But my revenge will come.
  King. Break not your sleeps for that
. You must not think
    That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
    That we can let our beard 
be shook with danger,
    And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more.
    I lov'd your fath
er, and we love ourself,
    And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine-

                 Enter
 a Messenger with letters.

    How now? What news?
  Mess. Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:
    T
his to your Majesty; this to the Queen.
  King. From Hamlet? Who brought them?
  Mess. Sailors, my
 lord, they say; I saw them not.
    They were given me by Claudio; he receiv'd them
    Of him th
at brought them.
  King. Laertes, you shall hear them.
    Leave us.
                            
                     Exit Messenger.
    [Reads]'High and Mighty,-You shall know I am set naked on

your
    kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes;
    when I shall (first as
king your pardon thereunto) recount the
    occasion of my sudden and more strange return.
       
                                              'HAMLET.'
    What should this mean? Are all the rest
 come back?
    Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?
  Laer. Know you the hand?
  King. 'Tis H
amlet's character. 'Naked!'
    And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'
    Can you advise me?

  Laer. I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come!
    It warms the very sickness in my heart
  
  That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,
    'Thus didest thou.'
  King. If it be so, Laerte
s
    (As how should it be so? how otherwise?),
    Will you be rul'd by me?
  Laer. Ay my lord,

    So you will not o'errule me to a peace.
  King. To thine own peace. If he be now return'd
   
 As checking at his voyage, and that he means
    No more to undertake it, I will work him
    To 
exploit now ripe in my device,
    Under the which he shall not choose but fall;
    And for his d
eath no wind shall breathe
    But even his mother shall uncharge the practice
    And call it acc
ident.
  Laer. My lord, I will be rul'd;
    The rather, if you could devise it so
    That I mig
ht be the organ.
  King. It falls right.
    You have been talk'd of since your travel much,
    
And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality
    Wherein they say you shine, Your sum of parts
    
Did not together pluck such envy from him
    As did that one; and that, in my regard,
    Of the 
unworthiest siege.
  Laer. What part is that, my lord?
  King. A very riband in the cap of youth-

    Yet needfull too; for youth no less becomes
    The light and careless livery that it wears
 
   Than settled age his sables and his weeds,
    Importing health and graveness. Two months since

    Here was a gentleman of Normandy.
    I have seen myself, and serv'd against, the French,
   
 And they can well on horseback; but this gallant
    Had witchcraft in't. He grew unto his seat,

    And to such wondrous doing brought his horse
    As had he been incorps'd and demi-natur'd
   
 With the brave beast. So far he topp'd my thought
    That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
  
  Come short of what he did.
  Laer. A Norman was't?
  King. A Norman.
  Laer. Upon my life, Lamo
und.
  King. The very same.
  Laer. I know him well. He is the broach indeed
    And gem of all t
he nation.
  King. He made confession of you;
    And gave you such a masterly report
    For art
 and exercise in your defence,
    And for your rapier most especially,
    That he cried out 'two
uld be a sight indeed
    If one could match you. The scrimers of their nation
    He swore had ne
ither motion, guard, nor eye,
    If you oppos'd them. Sir, this report of his
    Did Hamlet so e
nvenom with his envy
    That he could nothing do but wish and beg
    Your sudden coming o'er to 
play with you.
    Now, out of this-
  Laer. What out of this, my lord?
  King. Laertes, was your
 father dear to you?
    Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
    A face without a heart,'
 
 Laer. Why ask you this?
  King. Not that I think you did not love your father;
    But that I kno
w love is begun by time,
    And that I see, in passages of proof,
    Time qualifies the spark an
d fire of it.
    There lives within the very flame of love
    A kind of wick or snuff that will 
abate it;
    And nothing is at a like goodness still;
    For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
  
  Dies in his own too-much. That we would do,
    We should do when we would; for this 'would' chan
ges,
    And hath abatements and delays as many
    As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents
;
    And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
    That hurts by easing. But to the quic
k o' th' ulcer!
    Hamlet comes back. What would you undertake
    To show yourself your father's
 son in deed
    More than in words?
  Laer. To cut his throat i' th' church!
  King. No place in
deed should murther sanctuarize;
    Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,
    Will yo
u do this? Keep close within your chamber.
    Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home.
    W
e'll put on those shall praise your excellence
    And set a double varnish on the fame
    The Fr
enchman gave you; bring you in fine together
    And wager on your heads. He, being remiss,
    Mo
st generous, and free from all contriving,
    Will not peruse the foils; so that with ease,
    O
r with a little shuffling, you may choose
    A sword unbated, and, in a pass of practice,
    Req
uite him for your father.
  Laer. I will do't!
    And for that purpose I'll anoint my sword.
   
 I bought an unction of a mountebank,
    So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
    Where it draw
s blood no cataplasm so rare,
    Collected from all simples that have virtue
    Under the moon, 
can save the thing from death
    This is but scratch'd withal. I'll touch my point
    With this 
contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
    It may be death.
  King. Let's further think of this,

    Weigh what convenience both of time and means
    May fit us to our shape. If this should fal
l,
    And that our drift look through our bad performance.
    'Twere better not assay'd. Therefo
re this project
    Should have a back or second, that might hold
    If this did blast in proof. 
Soft! let me see.
    We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings-
    I ha't!
    When in your mo
tion you are hot and dry-
    As make your bouts more violent to that end-
    And that he calls f
or drink, I'll have prepar'd him
    A chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,
    If he by ch
ance escape your venom'd stuck,
    Our purpose may hold there.- But stay, what noise,

         
                  Enter Queen.

    How now, sweet queen?
  Queen. One woe doth tread upon anothe
r's heel,
    So fast they follow. Your sister's drown'd, Laertes.
  Laer. Drown'd! O, where?
  Q
ueen. There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
    That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream.

    There with fantastic garlands did she come
    Of crowflowers, nettles, daisies, and long purp
les,
    That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
    But our cold maids do dead men's fingers 
call them.
    There on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds
    Clamb'ring to hang, an envious sl
iver broke,
    When down her weedy trophies and herself
    Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothe
s spread wide
    And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up;
    Which time she chaunted snatches
 of old tunes,
    As one incapable of her own distress,
    Or like a creature native and indued

    Unto that element; but long it could not be
    Till that her garments, heavy with their drink
,
    Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay
    To muddy death.
  Laer. Alas, then she is
 drown'd?
  Queen. Drown'd, drown'd.
  Laer. Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
    And t
herefore I forbid my tears; but yet
    It is our trick; nature her custom holds,
    Let shame sa
y what it will. When these are gone,
    The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord.
    I have a speec
h of fire, that fain would blaze
    But that this folly douts it.                          Exit.

  King. Let's follow, Gertrude.
    How much I had to do to calm his rage I
    Now fear I this wi
ll give it start again;
    Therefore let's follow.
                                              
           Exeunt.

ACT V. Scene I.
Elsinore. A churchyard.

Enter two Clowns
, [with spades and pickaxes].

  Clown. Is she to be buried in Christian burial when she
wilfully

    seeks her own salvation?
  Other. I tell thee she is; therefore make her grave straight.
   
 The crowner hath sate on her, and finds it Christian burial.
  Clown. How can that be, unless she 
drown'd herself in her own
    defence?
  Other. Why, 'tis found so.
  Clown. It must be se offen
dendo; it cannot be else. For here
lies
    the point: if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an a
ct; and
an
    act hath three branches-it is to act, to do, and to perform;
    argal, she drown'
d herself wittingly.
  Other. Nay, but hear you, Goodman Delver!
  Clown. Give me leave. Here lies
 the water; good. Here stands
the
    man; good. If the man go to this water and drown himself, it

is,
    will he nill he, he goes- mark you that. But if the water
come to
    him and drown him
, he drowns not himself. Argal, he that is
not
    guilty of his own death shortens not his own li
fe.
  Other. But is this law?
  Clown. Ay, marry, is't- crowner's quest law.
  Other. Will you ha
' the truth an't? If this had not been a
    gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o' Christ
ian
burial.
  Clown. Why, there thou say'st! And the more pity that great
folk
    should have c
ount'nance in this world to drown or hang
themselves
    more than their even-Christian. Come, my 
spade! There is no
    ancient gentlemen but gard'ners, ditchers, and grave-makers.
They
    hold
 up Adam's profession.
  Other. Was he a gentleman?
  Clown. 'A was the first that ever bore arms.

  Other. Why, he had none.
  Clown. What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the
Scripture?

    The Scripture says Adam digg'd. Could he dig without arms?
I'll
    put another question to 
thee. If thou answerest me not to the
    purpose, confess thyself-
  Other. Go to!
  Clown. What
 is he that builds stronger than either the mason,
the
    shipwright, or the carpenter?
  Other.
 The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand
    tenants.
  Clown. I like thy wit well, 
in good faith. The gallows does
well.
    But how does it well? It does well to those that do ill.
 Now,
    thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the
    church. Argal, the gallo
ws may do well to thee. To't again,
come!
  Other. Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright,
 or a
    carpenter?
  Clown. Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
  Other. Marry, now I can tell!
  Cl
own. To't.
  Other. Mass, I cannot tell.

                 Enter Hamlet and Horatio afar off.


  Clown. Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull ass
will
    not mend his pace with bea
ting; and when you are ask'd this
    question next, say 'a grave-maker.' The houses he makes lasts

    till doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan; fetch me a stoup of
    liquor.
                    
                        [Exit Second Clown.]


                       [Clown digs and] sings.


       In youth when I did love, did love,
         Methought it was very sweet;
       To contrac
t- O- the time for- a- my behove,
         O, methought there- a- was nothing- a- meet.

  Ham. H
as this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings
at
    grave-making?
  Hor. Custom hath 
made it in him a property of easiness.
  Ham. 'Tis e'en so. The hand of little employment hath the

daintier
    sense.
  Clown. (sings)
         But age with his stealing steps
           Hath c
lawed me in his clutch,
         And hath shipped me intil the land,
           As if I had never 
been such.
                                            [Throws up a skull.]

  Ham. That skull ha
d a tongue in it, and could sing once. How
the
    knave jowls it to the ground,as if 'twere Cain'
s jawbone,
that
    did the first murther! This might be the pate of a
Politician,
    which thi
s ass now o'erreaches; one that would circumvent
God,
    might it not?
  Hor. It might, my lord.

  Ham. Or of a courtier, which could say 'Good morrow, sweet
lord!
    How dost thou, good lord?
' This might be my Lord Such-a-one,
that
    prais'd my Lord Such-a-one's horse when he meant to b
eg it-
might
    it not?
  Hor. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Why, e'en so! and now my Lady Worm's, chaple
ss, and
knock'd
    about the mazzard with a sexton's spade. Here's fine
revolution,
    and we 
had the trick to see't. Did these bones cost no more
the
    breeding but to play at loggets with 
'em? Mine ache to think
    on't.
  Clown. (Sings)
         A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,
    
       For and a shrouding sheet;
         O, a Pit of clay for to be made
           For such a g
uest is meet.
                                      Throws up [another skull].

  Ham. There's an
other. Why may not that be the skull of a
lawyer?
    Where be his quiddits now, his quillets, his
 cases, his
tenures,
    and his tricks? Why does he suffer this rude knave now to
knock
    him
 about the sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell
him
    of his action of battery? Hum! Th
is fellow might be in's time
a
    great buyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizances,
his

    fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries. Is this the fine
of
    his fines, and the recov
ery of his recoveries, to have his
fine
    pate full of fine dirt? Will his vouchers vouch him no
 more
of
    his purchases, and double ones too, than the length and
breadth
    of a pair of in
dentures? The very conveyances of his lands
will
    scarcely lie in this box; and must th' inheri
tor himself have
no
    more, ha?
  Hor. Not a jot more, my lord.
  Ham. Is not parchment made o
f sheepskins?
  Hor. Ay, my lord, And of calveskins too.
  Ham. They are sheep and calves which se
ek out assurance in
that. I
    will speak to this fellow. Whose grave's this, sirrah?
  Clown. M
ine, sir.

    [Sings] O, a pit of clay for to be made
              For such a guest is meet.


  Ham. I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in't.
  Clown. You lie out on't, sir, and theref
ore 'tis not yours.
    For my part, I do not lie in't, yet it is mine.
  Ham. Thou dost lie in't,
 to be in't and say it is thine. 'Tis
for
    the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.

  Clown. 'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away again from me to you.
  Ham. What man dost thou dig it 
for?
  Clown. For no man, sir.
  Ham. What woman then?
  Clown. For none neither.
  Ham. Who is 
to be buried in't?
  Clown. One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's
dead.
  Ham. How
 absolute the knave is! We must speak by the card, or
    equivocation will undo us. By the Lord, H
oratio, this three
years
    I have taken note of it, the age is grown so picked that the
toe
  
  of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he
galls
    his kibe.- How long hast thou
 been a grave-maker?
  Clown. Of all the days i' th' year, I came to't that day that
our
    last
 king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.
  Ham. How long is that since?
  Clown. Cannot you tell that? Ev
ery fool can tell that. It was
the
    very day that young Hamlet was born- he that is mad, and se
nt
    into England.
  Ham. Ay, marry, why was be sent into England?
  Clown. Why, because 'a was
 mad. 'A shall recover his wits
there;
    or, if 'a do not, 'tis no great matter there.
  Ham. W
hy?
  Clown. 'Twill not he seen in him there. There the men are as
mad as
    he.
  Ham. How cam
e he mad?
  Clown. Very strangely, they say.
  Ham. How strangely?
  Clown. Faith, e'en with losi
ng his wits.
  Ham. Upon what ground?
  Clown. Why, here in Denmark. I have been sexton here, man 
and
boy
    thirty years.
  Ham. How long will a man lie i' th' earth ere he rot?
  Clown. Faith
, if 'a be not rotten before 'a die (as we have
many
    pocky corses now-a-days that will scarce 
hold the laying in,
I
    will last you some eight year or nine year. A tanner will
last
    you
 nine year.
  Ham. Why he more than another?
  Clown. Why, sir, his hide is so tann'd with his tra
de that 'a
will
    keep out water a great while; and your water is a sore
decayer of
    your w
horeson dead body. Here's a skull now. This skull hath
lien
    you i' th' earth three-and-twenty 
years.
  Ham. Whose was it?
  Clown. A whoreson, mad fellow's it was. Whose do you think it
was?

  Ham. Nay, I know not.
  Clown. A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! 'A pour'd a flagon
of
    
Rhenish on my head once. This same skull, sir, was Yorick's
    skull, the King's jester.
  Ham. T
his?
  Clown. E'en that.
  Ham. Let me see. [Takes the skull.] Alas, poor Yorick! I knew
him,
  
  Horatio. A fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy.
He
    hath borne me on his back a 
thousand times. And now how
abhorred
    in my imagination it is! My gorge rises at it. Here hung

those
    lips that I have kiss'd I know not how oft. Where be your
gibes
    now? your gambols?
 your songs? your flashes of merriment that
    were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, 
to mock
your
    own grinning? Quite chap- fall'n? Now get you to my lady's
    chamber, and tell
 her, let her paint an inch thick, to this
    favour she must come. Make her laugh at that. Prithe
e,
Horatio,
    tell me one thing.
  Hor. What's that, my lord?
  Ham. Dost thou think Alexander
 look'd o' this fashion i' th'
earth?
  Hor. E'en so.
  Ham. And smelt so? Pah!
                
                          [Puts down the skull.]
  Hor. E'en so, my lord.
  Ham. To what base uses
 we may return, Horatio! Why may not
    imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find
 it
    stopping a bunghole?
  Hor. 'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.
  Ham. No, 
faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with
modesty
    enough, and likelihood to lead it; as
 thus: Alexander died,
    Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust
is
    e
arth; of earth we make loam; and why of that loam (whereto
he
    was converted) might they not st
op a beer barrel?
    Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
    Might stop a hole to keep the
 wind away.
    O, that that earth which kept the world in awe
    Should patch a wall t' expel th
e winter's flaw!
    But soft! but soft! aside! Here comes the King-

    Enter [priests with] a 
coffin [in funeral procession], King,
             Queen, Laertes, with Lords attendant.]

    Th
e Queen, the courtiers. Who is this they follow?
    And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken

    The corse they follow did with desp'rate hand
    Fordo it own life. 'Twas of some estate.
  
  Couch we awhile, and mark.
                                         [Retires with Horatio.]

  
Laer. What ceremony else?
  Ham. That is Laertes,
    A very noble youth. Mark.
  Laer. What cere
mony else?
  Priest. Her obsequies have been as far enlarg'd
    As we have warranty. Her death wa
s doubtful;
    And, but that great command o'ersways the order,
    She should in ground unsancti
fied have lodg'd
    Till the last trumpet. For charitable prayers,
    Shards, flints, and pebble
s should be thrown on her.
    Yet here she is allow'd her virgin rites,
    Her maiden strewments
, and the bringing home
    Of bell and burial.
  Laer. Must there no more be done?
  Priest. No 
more be done.
    We should profane the service of the dead
    To sing a requiem and such rest to
 her
    As to peace-parted souls.
  Laer. Lay her i' th' earth;
    And from her fair and unpoll
uted flesh
    May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,
    A minist'ring angel shall my 
sister be
    When thou liest howling.
  Ham. What, the fair Ophelia?
  Queen. Sweets to the swee
t! Farewell.
                                             [Scatters flowers.]
    I hop'd thou sho
uldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
    I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
    And 
not have strew'd thy grave.
  Laer. O, treble woe
    Fall ten times treble on that cursed head
 
   Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
    Depriv'd thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,
   
 Till I have caught her once more in mine arms.
                                             Leaps 
in the grave.
    Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead
    Till of this flat a mountain you 
have made
    T' o'ertop old Pelion or the skyish head
    Of blue Olympus.
  Ham. [comes forward
] What is he whose grief
    Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow
    Conjures the wand'
ring stars, and makes them stand
    Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,
    Hamlet the Dane. 
                   [Leaps in after Laertes.
  Laer. The devil take thy soul!
                     
                       [Grapples with him].
  Ham. Thou pray'st not well.
    I prithee take thy f
ingers from my throat;
    For, though I am not splenitive and rash,
    Yet have I in me somethin
g dangerous,
    Which let thy wisdom fear. Hold off thy hand!
  King. Pluck them asunder.
  Quee
n. Hamlet, Hamlet!
  All. Gentlemen!
  Hor. Good my lord, be quiet.
             [The Attendants 
part them, and they come out of the
                                                         grave.
]
  Ham. Why, I will fight with him upon this theme
    Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
  Qu
een. O my son, what theme?
  Ham. I lov'd Ophelia. Forty thousand brothers
    Could not (with all
 their quantity of love)
    Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?
  King. O, he is mad, Laer
tes.
  Queen. For love of God, forbear him!
  Ham. 'Swounds, show me what thou't do.
    Woo't we
ep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?
    Woo't drink up esill? eat a crocodile?
    I'
ll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?
    To outface me with leaping in her grave?
    Be buried 
quick with her, and so will I.
    And if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
    Millions of 
acres on us, till our ground,
    Singeing his pate against the burning zone,
    Make Ossa like a
 wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
    I'll rant as well as thou.
  Queen. This is mere madness;
    A
nd thus a while the fit will work on him.
    Anon, as patient as the female dove
    When that he
r golden couplets are disclos'd,
    His silence will sit drooping.
  Ham. Hear you, sir!
    Wha
t is the reason that you use me thus?
    I lov'd you ever. But it is no matter.
    Let Hercules 
himself do what he may,
    The cat will mew, and dog will have his day.
Exit.
  King. I pray the
e, good Horatio, wait upon him.
                                                   Exit Horatio.
 
   [To Laertes] Strengthen your patience in our last night's
speech.
    We'll put the matter to t
he present push.-
    Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.-
    This grave shall have a li
ving monument.
    An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
    Till then in patience our proceeding
 be.
                                                         Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore.
 A hall in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet and Horatio.

  Ham. So much for this, sir; now shall you s
ee the other.
    You do remember all the circumstance?
  Hor. Remember it, my lord!
  Ham. Sir, 
in my heart there was a kind of fighting
    That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay
    Wors
e than the mutinies in the bilboes. Rashly-
    And prais'd be rashness for it; let us know,
    O
ur indiscretion sometime serves us well
    When our deep plots do pall; and that should learn us

    There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
    Rough-hew them how we will-
  Hor. That is most c
ertain.
  Ham. Up from my cabin,
    My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
    Grop'd I to fi
nd out them; had my desire,
    Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew
    To mine own room a
gain; making so bold
    (My fears forgetting manners) to unseal
    Their grand commission; where
 I found, Horatio
    (O royal knavery!), an exact command,
    Larded with many several sorts of 
reasons,
    Importing Denmark's health, and England's too,
    With, hoo! such bugs and goblins i
n my life-
    That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
    No, not to stay the finding of the ax
e,
    My head should be struck off.
  Hor. Is't possible?
  Ham. Here's the commission; read it 
at more leisure.
    But wilt thou bear me how I did proceed?
  Hor. I beseech you.
  Ham. Being 
thus benetted round with villanies,
    Or I could make a prologue to my brains,
    They had begu
n the play. I sat me down;
    Devis'd a new commission; wrote it fair.
    I once did hold it, as
 our statists do,
    A baseness to write fair, and labour'd much
    How to forget that learning;
 but, sir, now
    It did me yeoman's service. Wilt thou know
    Th' effect of what I wrote?
  H
or. Ay, good my lord.
  Ham. An earnest conjuration from the King,
    As England was his faithful
 tributary,
    As love between them like the palm might flourish,
    As peace should still her w
heaten garland wear
    And stand a comma 'tween their amities,
    And many such-like as's of gre
at charge,
    That, on the view and knowing of these contents,
    Without debatement further, mo
re or less,
    He should the bearers put to sudden death,
    Not shriving time allow'd.
  Hor. 
How was this seal'd?
  Ham. Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
    I had my father's signet in
 my purse,
    Which was the model of that Danish seal;
    Folded the writ up in the form of th' 
other,
    Subscrib'd it, gave't th' impression, plac'd it safely,
    The changeling never known.
 Now, the next day
    Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent
    Thou know'st already.

  Hor. So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.
  Ham. Why, man, they did make love to this employm
ent!
    They are not near my conscience; their defeat
    Does by their own insinuation grow.
  
  'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
    Between the pass and fell incensed points
    Of 
mighty opposites.
  Hor. Why, what a king is this!
  Ham. Does it not, thinks't thee, stand me now
 upon-
    He that hath kill'd my king, and whor'd my mother;
    Popp'd in between th' election a
nd my hopes;
    Thrown out his angle for my proper life,
    And with such coz'nage- is't not per
fect conscience
    To quit him with this arm? And is't not to be damn'd
    To let this canker of
 our nature come
    In further evil?
  Hor. It must be shortly known to him from England
    Wha
t is the issue of the business there.
  Ham. It will be short; the interim is mine,
    And a man'
s life is no more than to say 'one.'
    But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
    That to Laertes I 
forgot myself,
    For by the image of my cause I see
    The portraiture of his. I'll court his f
avours.
    But sure the bravery of his grief did put me
    Into a tow'ring passion.
  Hor. Peac
e! Who comes here?

                 Enter young Osric, a courtier.

  Osr. Your lordship is rig
ht welcome back to Denmark.
  Ham. I humbly thank you, sir. [Aside to Horatio] Dost know this
    
waterfly?
  Hor. [aside to Hamlet] No, my good lord.
  Ham. [aside to Horatio] Thy state is the mo
re gracious; for
'tis a
    vice to know him. He hath much land, and fertile. Let a beast
be
   
 lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at the king's mess.
'Tis
    a chough; but, as I say, sp
acious in the possession of dirt.

  Osr. Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should

impart
    a thing to you from his Majesty.
  Ham. I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of s
pirit. Put
your
    bonnet to his right use. 'Tis for the head.
  Osr. I thank your lordship, it 
is very hot.
  Ham. No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly.
  Osr. It is indifferen
t cold, my lord, indeed.
  Ham. But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my
complexion.
  O
sr. Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry, as 'twere- I
cannot
    tell how. But, my lord, his M
ajesty bade me signify to you
that
    he has laid a great wager on your head. Sir, this is the
m
atter-
  Ham. I beseech you remember.
                           [Hamlet moves him to put on his h
at.]
  Osr. Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here
is
    newly come to court
 Laertes; believe me, an absolute
gentleman,
    full of most excellent differences, of very soft 
society and
    great showing. Indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the
card
    or calendar 
of gentry; for you shall find in him the
continent of
    what part a gentleman would see.
  Ham.
 Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you; though, I

    know, to divide him inventorially
 would dozy th' arithmetic
of
    memory, and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail.
 
   But, in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of
great
    article, and his infusion
 of such dearth and rareness as, to
make
    true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror, and
 who
else
    would trace him, his umbrage, nothing more.
  Osr. Your lordship speaks most infall
ibly of him.
  Ham. The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our
more
    rawer brea
th?
  Osr. Sir?
  Hor [aside to Hamlet] Is't not possible to understand in
another
    tongue? Y
ou will do't, sir, really.
  Ham. What imports the nomination of this gentleman?
  Osr. Of Laertes
?
  Hor. [aside] His purse is empty already. All's golden words are
    spent.
  Ham. Of him, sir
.
  Osr. I know you are not ignorant-
  Ham. I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it w
ould
not
    much approve me. Well, sir?
  Osr. You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes i
s-
  Ham. I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in
    excellence; but to know a
 man well were to know himself.
  Osr. I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on

him
    by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.
  Ham. What's his weapon?
  Osr. Rapier and dagger.

  Ham. That's two of his weapons- but well.
  Osr. The King, sir, hath wager'd with him six Barba
ry horses;
    against the which he has impon'd, as I take it, six French
    rapiers and poniards
, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers,
and
    so. Three of the carriages, in faith, are very d
ear to fancy,
    very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of
    very liberal c
onceit.
  Ham. What call you the carriages?
  Hor. [aside to Hamlet] I knew you must be edified by
 the
margent
    ere you had done.
  Osr. The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
  Ham. The phrase
 would be more germane to the matter if we could
    carry cannon by our sides. I would it might be
 hangers till
then.
    But on! Six Barbary horses against six French swords, their
    assigns, 
and three liberal-conceited carriages: that's the
French
    bet against the Danish. Why is this a
ll impon'd, as you call
it?
  Osr. The King, sir, hath laid that, in a dozen passes between
    y
ourself and him, he shall not exceed you three hits; he hath
    laid on twelve for nine, and it wo
uld come to immediate trial
    if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.
  Ham. How if I answe
r no?
  Osr. I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
  Ham. Sir, I will walk here
 in the hall. If it please his
Majesty,
    it is the breathing time of day with me. Let the foils
 be
    brought, the gentleman willing, and the King hold his
purpose,
    I will win for him if 
I can; if not, I will gain nothing but
my
    shame and the odd hits.
  Osr. Shall I redeliver yo
u e'en so?
  Ham. To this effect, sir, after what flourish your nature will.
  Osr. I commend my d
uty to your lordship.
  Ham. Yours, yours. [Exit Osric.] He does well to commend it
    himself; t
here are no tongues else for's turn.
  Hor. This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.
  H
am. He did comply with his dug before he suck'd it. Thus has
he,
    and many more of the same bev
y that I know the drossy age
dotes
    on, only got the tune of the time and outward habit of
enc
ounter-
    a kind of yesty collection, which carries them through and
    through the most fann'd
 and winnowed opinions; and do but
blow
    them to their trial-the bubbles are out,

          
                  Enter a Lord.

  Lord. My lord, his Majesty commended him to you by young Osric,

who
    brings back to him, that you attend him in the hall. He sends
to
    know if your pleas
ure hold to play with Laertes, or that you
will
    take longer time.
  Ham. I am constant to my 
purposes; they follow the King's
pleasure.
    If his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or whenso
ever,
provided
    I be so able as now.
  Lord. The King and Queen and all are coming down.
  Ha
m. In happy time.
  Lord. The Queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to
    Laertes be
fore you fall to play.
  Ham. She well instructs me.
                                             
       [Exit Lord.]
  Hor. You will lose this wager, my lord.
  Ham. I do not think so. Since he w
ent into France I have been
in
    continual practice. I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst

not
    think how ill all's here about my heart. But it is no matter.
  Hor. Nay, good my lord -

  Ham. It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gaingiving as
    would perhaps trouble a woman.

  Hor. If your mind dislike anything, obey it. I will forestall
their
    repair hither and say 
you are not fit.
  Ham. Not a whit, we defy augury; there's a special providence
in
    the fall 
of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not to come; if it
be
    not to come, it will be now; if it be n
ot now, yet it will
come:
    the readiness is all. Since no man knows aught of what he
leaves,

    what is't to leave betimes? Let be.

    Enter King, Queen, Laertes, Osric, and Lords, with ot
her
              Attendants with foils and gauntlets.
               A table and flagons of wine 
on it.

  King. Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
                    [The King put
s Laertes' hand into Hamlet's.]
  Ham. Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong;
    But pa
rdon't, as you are a gentleman.
    This presence knows,
    And you must needs have heard, how I 
am punish'd
    With sore distraction. What I have done
    That might your nature, honour, and ex
ception
    Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
    Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Ha
mlet.
    If Hamlet from himself be taken away,
    And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,

    Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
    Who does it, then? His madness. If't be so,
  
  Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
    His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
    Sir, in th
is audience,
    Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd evil
    Free me so far in your most generous 
thoughts
    That I have shot my arrow o'er the house
    And hurt my brother.
  Laer. I am satis
fied in nature,
    Whose motive in this case should stir me most
    To my revenge. But in my ter
ms of honour
    I stand aloof, and will no reconcilement
    Till by some elder masters of known 
honour
    I have a voice and precedent of peace
    To keep my name ungor'd. But till that time

    I do receive your offer'd love like love,
    And will not wrong it.
  Ham. I embrace it freel
y,
    And will this brother's wager frankly play.
    Give us the foils. Come on.
  Laer. Come, 
one for me.
  Ham. I'll be your foil, Laertes. In mine ignorance
    Your skill shall, like a star
 i' th' darkest night,
    Stick fiery off indeed.
  Laer. You mock me, sir.
  Ham. No, by this h
and.
  King. Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
    You know the wager?
  Ham. Very
 well, my lord.
    Your Grace has laid the odds o' th' weaker side.
  King. I do not fear it, I h
ave seen you both;
    But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.
  Laer. This is too heavy
; let me see another.
  Ham. This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
                  
                              Prepare to play.
  Osr. Ay, my good lord.
  King. Set me the stoups 
of wine upon that table.
    If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
    Or quit in answer of the 
third exchange,
    Let all the battlements their ordnance fire;
    The King shall drink to Hamle
t's better breath,
    And in the cup an union shall he throw
    Richer than that which four succ
essive kings
    In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;
    And let the kettle to the tru
mpet speak,
    The trumpet to the cannoneer without,
    The cannons to the heavens, the heaven t
o earth,
    'Now the King drinks to Hamlet.' Come, begin.
    And you the judges, bear a wary eye
.
  Ham. Come on, sir.
  Laer. Come, my lord.                                They play.
  Ham. On
e.
  Laer. No.
  Ham. Judgment!
  Osr. A hit, a very palpable hit.
  Laer. Well, again!
  King.
 Stay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
    Here's to thy health.
               [Drum;
 trumpets sound; a piece goes off [within].
    Give him the cup.
  Ham. I'll play this bout first
; set it by awhile.
    Come. (They play.) Another hit. What say you?
  Laer. A touch, a touch; I 
do confess't.
  King. Our son shall win.
  Queen. He's fat, and scant of breath.
    Here, Hamlet
, take my napkin, rub thy brows.
    The Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
  Ham. Good madam!

  King. Gertrude, do not drink.
  Queen. I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.          Drinks.

  King. [aside] It is the poison'd cup; it is too late.
  Ham. I dare not drink yet, madam; by-and
-by.
  Queen. Come, let me wipe thy face.
  Laer. My lord, I'll hit him now.
  King. I do not thi
nk't.
  Laer. [aside] And yet it is almost against my conscience.
  Ham. Come for the third, Laert
es! You but dally.
    Pray you pass with your best violence;
    I am afeard you make a wanton of
 me.
  Laer. Say you so? Come on.                               Play.
  Osr. Nothing neither way.

  Laer. Have at you now!
                [Laertes wounds Hamlet; then] in scuffling, they
       
             change rapiers, [and Hamlet wounds Laertes].
  King. Part them! They are incens'd.
  
Ham. Nay come! again!                         The Queen falls.

  Osr. Look to the Queen there, ho
!
  Hor. They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?
  Osr. How is't, Laertes?
  Laer. Why, as 
a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric.
    I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.
  Ham. How 
does the Queen?
  King. She sounds to see them bleed.
  Queen. No, no! the drink, the drink! O my 
dear Hamlet!
    The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.                 [Dies.]
  Ham. O villany! Ho
! let the door be lock'd.
    Treachery! Seek it out.
                                            
    [Laertes falls.]
  Laer. It is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain;
    No medicine in the wo
rld can do thee good.
    In thee there is not half an hour of life.
    The treacherous instrumen
t is in thy hand,
    Unbated and envenom'd. The foul practice
    Hath turn'd itself on me. Lo, h
ere I lie,
    Never to rise again. Thy mother's poison'd.
    I can no more. The King, the King's
 to blame.
  Ham. The point envenom'd too?
    Then, venom, to thy work.                    Hurts 
the King.
  All. Treason! treason!
  King. O, yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt.
  Ham. Here,
 thou incestuous, murd'rous, damned Dane,
    Drink off this potion! Is thy union here?
    Follow
 my mother.                                 King dies.
  Laer. He is justly serv'd.
    It is a po
ison temper'd by himself.
    Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet.
    Mine and my father's
 death come not upon thee,
    Nor thine on me!                                       Dies.
  Ham.
 Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.
    I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!
    Yo
u that look pale and tremble at this chance,
    That are but mutes or audience to this act,
    H
ad I but time (as this fell sergeant, Death,
    Is strict in his arrest) O, I could tell you-
   
 But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;
    Thou liv'st; report me and my cause aright
    To the unsa
tisfied.
  Hor. Never believe it.
    I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.
    Here's yet some
 liquor left.
  Ham. As th'art a man,
    Give me the cup. Let go! By heaven, I'll ha't.
    O go
od Horatio, what a wounded name
    (Things standing thus unknown) shall live behind me!
    If th
ou didst ever hold me in thy heart,
    Absent thee from felicity awhile,
    And in this harsh wo
rld draw thy breath in pain,
    To tell my story.         [March afar off, and shot within.]
    
What warlike noise is this?
  Osr. Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
    To the am
bassadors of England gives
    This warlike volley.
  Ham. O, I die, Horatio!
    The potent pois
on quite o'ercrows my spirit.
    I cannot live to hear the news from England,
    But I do prophe
sy th' election lights
    On Fortinbras. He has my dying voice.
    So tell him, with th' occurre
nts, more and less,
    Which have solicited- the rest is silence.             Dies.
  Hor. Now cr
acks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince,
    And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
   
                                              [March within.]
    Why does the drum come hither?


    Enter Fortinbras and English Ambassadors, with Drum,
                  Colours, and Attendants
.

  Fort. Where is this sight?
  Hor. What is it you will see?
    If aught of woe or wonder, c
ease your search.
  Fort. This quarry cries on havoc. O proud Death,
    What feast is toward in t
hine eternal cell
    That thou so many princes at a shot
    So bloodily hast struck.
  Ambassad
or. The sight is dismal;
    And our affairs from England come too late.
    The ears are senseles
s that should give us hearing
    To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd
    That Rosencrantz an
d Guildenstern are dead.
    Where should we have our thanks?
  Hor. Not from his mouth,
    Had 
it th' ability of life to thank you.
    He never gave commandment for their death.
    But since,
 so jump upon this bloody question,
    You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
    Are he
re arriv'd, give order that these bodies
    High on a stage be placed to the view;
    And let me
 speak to the yet unknowing world
    How these things came about. So shall you hear
    Of carnal
, bloody and unnatural acts;
    Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters;
    Of deaths put on 
by cunning and forc'd cause;
    And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
    Fall'n on th' inventors
' heads. All this can I
    Truly deliver.
  Fort. Let us haste to hear it,
    And call the nobl
est to the audience.
    For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.
    I have some rights of memor
y in this kingdom
    Which now, to claim my vantage doth invite me.
  Hor. Of that I shall have a
lso cause to speak,
    And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more.
    But let this same be
 presently perform'd,
    Even while men's minds are wild, lest more mischance
    On plots and er
rors happen.
  Fort. Let four captains
    Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage;
    For he wa
s likely, had he been put on,
    To have prov'd most royally; and for his passage
    The soldier
s' music and the rites of war
    Speak loudly for him.
    Take up the bodies. Such a sight as th
is
    Becomes the field but here shows much amiss.
    Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
            E
xeunt marching; after the which a peal of ordnance
                                                
   are shot off.

ACT I. Scene I.
Elsinore.
 A platform before the Castle.

Enter two Sentinels-[first,] Francisco, [who paces up and down
at
 his post; then] Bernardo, [who approaches him].

  Ber. Who's there?
  Fran. Nay, answer me. Sta
nd and unfold yourself.
  Ber. Long live the King!
  Fran. Bernardo?
  Ber. He.
  Fran. You come
 most carefully upon your hour.
  Ber. 'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.
  Fran.
 For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold,
    And I am sick at heart.
  Ber. Have you had qu
iet guard?
  Fran. Not a mouse stirring.
  Ber. Well, good night.
    If you do meet Horatio and 
Marcellus,
    The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.

                    Enter Horatio an
d Marcellus.

  Fran. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?
  Hor. Friends to this ground
.
  Mar. And liegemen to the Dane.
  Fran. Give you good night.
  Mar. O, farewell, honest soldie
r.
    Who hath reliev'd you?
  Fran. Bernardo hath my place.
    Give you good night.           
                        Exit.
  Mar. Holla, Bernardo!
  Ber. Say-
    What, is Horatio there ?
 
 Hor. A piece of him.
  Ber. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.
  Mar. What, has this thin
g appear'd again to-night?
  Ber. I have seen nothing.
  Mar. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,

    And will not let belief take hold of him
    Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.
  
  Therefore I have entreated him along,
    With us to watch the minutes of this night,
    That, 
if again this apparition come,
    He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
  Hor. Tush, tush, 'tw
ill not appear.
  Ber. Sit down awhile,
    And let us once again assail your ears,
    That are 
so fortified against our story,
    What we two nights have seen.
  Hor. Well, sit we down,
    A
nd let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
  Ber. Last night of all,
    When yond same star that's we
stward from the pole
    Had made his course t' illume that part of heaven
    Where now it burns,
 Marcellus and myself,
    The bell then beating one-

                        Enter Ghost.

  
Mar. Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!
  Ber. In the same figure, like the King tha
t's dead.
  Mar. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
  Ber. Looks it not like the King? Mark
 it, Horatio.
  Hor. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.
  Ber. It would be spoke to.

  Mar. Question it, Horatio.
  Hor. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night
    Together wi
th that fair and warlike form
    In which the majesty of buried Denmark
    Did sometimes march? 
By heaven I charge thee speak!
  Mar. It is offended.
  Ber. See, it stalks away!
  Hor. Stay! Sp
eak, speak! I charge thee speak!
                                                     Exit Ghost.

  Mar. 'Tis gone and will not answer.
  Ber. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale.
    Is n
ot this something more than fantasy?
    What think you on't?
  Hor. Before my God, I might not th
is believe
    Without the sensible and true avouch
    Of mine own eyes.
  Mar. Is it not like t
he King?
  Hor. As thou art to thyself.
    Such was the very armour he had on
    When he th' am
bitious Norway combated.
    So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,
    He smote the sledded 
Polacks on the ice.
    'Tis strange.
  Mar. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
    W
ith martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
  Hor. In what particular thought to work I know not;

    But, in the gross and scope of my opinion,
    This bodes some strange eruption to our state.

  Mar. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows,
    Why this same strict and most observant 
watch
    So nightly toils the subject of the land,
    And why such daily cast of brazen cannon

    And foreign mart for implements of war;
    Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
 
   Does not divide the Sunday from the week.
    What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
    
Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day?
    Who is't that can inform me?
  Hor. That can 
I.
    At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
    Whose image even but now appear'd to us,

    Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
    Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
  
  Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet
    (For so this side of our known world esteem'
d him)
    Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,
    Well ratified by law and herald
ry,
    Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
    Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqu
eror;
    Against the which a moiety competent
    Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
    
To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
    Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant
    And car
riage of the article design'd,
    His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
    Of unimprov
ed mettle hot and full,
    Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,
    Shark'd up a list of
 lawless resolutes,
    For food and diet, to some enterprise
    That hath a stomach in't; which 
is no other,
    As it doth well appear unto our state,
    But to recover of us, by strong hand

    And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
    So by his father lost; and this, I take it,
 
   Is the main motive of our preparations,
    The source of this our watch, and the chief head
  
  Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
  Ber. I think it be no other but e'en so.
    Well m
ay it sort that this portentous figure
    Comes armed through our watch, so like the King
    Tha
t was and is the question of these wars.
  Hor. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
    In the
 most high and palmy state of Rome,
    A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
    The graves sto
od tenantless, and the sheeted dead
    Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;
    As stars w
ith trains of fire, and dews of blood,
    Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
    Upon whose
 influence Neptune's empire stands
    Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.
    And even the 
like precurse of fierce events,
    As harbingers preceding still the fates
    And prologue to th
e omen coming on,
    Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
    Unto our climature and count
rymen.

                      Enter Ghost again.

    But soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again
!
    I'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!
                                         
      Spreads his arms.
    If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
    Speak to me.
    If ther
e be any good thing to be done,
    That may to thee do ease, and, race to me,
    Speak to me.
 
   If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
    Which happily foreknowing may avoid,
    O, speak!

    Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
    Extorted treasure in the womb of earth
    (For wh
ich, they say, you spirits oft walk in death),
                                                 The
 cock crows.
    Speak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!
  Mar. Shall I strike at it wi
th my partisan?
  Hor. Do, if it will not stand.
  Ber. 'Tis here!
  Hor. 'Tis here!
  Mar. 'Tis
 gone!
                                                     Exit Ghost.
    We do it wrong, being 
so majestical,
    To offer it the show of violence;
    For it is as the air, invulnerable,
    
And our vain blows malicious mockery.
  Ber. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
  Hor. And
 then it started, like a guilty thing
    Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
    The cock, that 
is the trumpet to the morn,
    Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
    Awake the god o
f day; and at his warning,
    Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
    Th' extravagant and er
ring spirit hies
    To his confine; and of the truth herein
    This present object made probatio
n.
  Mar. It faded on the crowing of the cock.
    Some say that ever, 'gainst that season comes

    Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
    The bird of dawning singeth all night long;
   
 And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,
    The nights are wholesome, then no planets stri
ke,
    No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
    So hallow'd and so gracious is the time
.
  Hor. So have I heard and do in part believe it.
    But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,

    Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.
    Break we our watch up; and by my advice
  
  Let us impart what we have seen to-night
    Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
    This spir
it, dumb to us, will speak to him.
    Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
    As needfu
l in our loves, fitting our duty?
    Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
    Where we sha
ll find him most conveniently.           Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A room of state in th
e Castle.

Flourish. [Enter Claudius, King of Denmark, Gertrude the Queen,
Hamlet,
Polonius, Lae
rtes and his sister Ophelia, [Voltemand, Cornelius,]
Lords Attendant.

  King. Though yet of Haml
et our dear brother's death
    The memory be green, and that it us befitted
    To bear our heart
s in grief, and our whole kingdom
    To be contracted in one brow of woe,
    Yet so far hath dis
cretion fought with nature
    That we with wisest sorrow think on him
    Together with remembran
ce of ourselves.
    Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
    Th' imperial jointress to t
his warlike state,
    Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,
    With an auspicious, and a dropp
ing eye,
    With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,
    In equal scale weighing deligh
t and dole,
    Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd
    Your better wisdoms, which have freel
y gone
    With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
    Now follows, that you know, young Fort
inbras,
    Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
    Or thinking by our late dear brother's death

    Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
    Colleagued with this dream of his advantage,

    He hath not fail'd to pester us with message
    Importing the surrender of those lands
    Lo
st by his father, with all bands of law,
    To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
    Now
 for ourself and for this time of meeting.
    Thus much the business is: we have here writ
    To
 Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,
    Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears
    Of this his n
ephew's purpose, to suppress
    His further gait herein, in that the levies,
    The lists, and f
ull proportions are all made
    Out of his subject; and we here dispatch
    You, good Cornelius,
 and you, Voltemand,
    For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,
    Giving to you no further 
personal power
    To business with the King, more than the scope
    Of these dilated articles al
low.            [Gives a paper.]
    Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
  Cor., Volt.
 In that, and all things, will we show our duty.
  King. We doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell.
 
                                Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius.
    And now, Laertes, what's the ne
ws with you?
    You told us of some suit. What is't, Laertes?
    You cannot speak of reason to t
he Dane
    And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
    That shall not be my offer, n
ot thy asking?
    The head is not more native to the heart,
    The hand more instrumental to the
 mouth,
    Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
    What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
  L
aer. My dread lord,
    Your leave and favour to return to France;
    From whence though willingl
y I came to Denmark
    To show my duty in your coronation,
    Yet now I must confess, that duty 
done,
    My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
    And bow them to your gracious leave 
and pardon.
  King. Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
  Pol. He hath, my lord, wru
ng from me my slow leave
    By laboursome petition, and at last
    Upon his will I seal'd my har
d consent.
    I do beseech you give him leave to go.
  King. Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be
 thine,
    And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
    But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son-

  Ham. [aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind!
  King. How is it that the clouds still 
hang on you?
  Ham. Not so, my lord. I am too much i' th' sun.
  Queen. Good Hamlet, cast thy nigh
ted colour off,
    And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
    Do not for ever with thy 
vailed lids
    Seek for thy noble father in the dust.
    Thou know'st 'tis common. All that live
s must die,
    Passing through nature to eternity.
  Ham. Ay, madam, it is common.
  Queen. If i
t be,
    Why seems it so particular with thee?
  Ham. Seems, madam, Nay, it is. I know not 'seems
.'
    'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
    Nor customary suits of solemn black,
    No
r windy suspiration of forc'd breath,
    No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
    Nor the dejec
ted havior of the visage,
    Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
    'That can denot
e me truly. These indeed seem,
    For they are actions that a man might play;
    But I have that
 within which passeth show-
    These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
  King. 'Tis sweet a
nd commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
    To give these mourning duties to your father;
    But y
ou must know, your father lost a father;
    That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
  
  In filial obligation for some term
    To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever
    In obstinate
 condolement is a course
    Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief;
    It shows a will most
 incorrect to heaven,
    A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
    An understanding simple and u
nschool'd;
    For what we know must be, and is as common
    As any the most vulgar thing to sens
e,
    Why should we in our peevish opposition
    Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,

    A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
    To reason most absurd, whose common theme
  
  Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
    From the first corse till he that died to-day,

    'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth
    This unprevailing woe, and think of us
   
 As of a father; for let the world take note
    You are the most immediate to our throne,
    And
 with no less nobility of love
    Than that which dearest father bears his son
    Do I impart to
ward you. For your intent
    In going back to school in Wittenberg,
    It is most retrograde to 
our desire;
    And we beseech you, bend you to remain
    Here in the cheer and comfort of our ey
e,
    Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
  Queen. Let not thy mother lose her prayers, H
amlet.
    I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.
  Ham. I shall in all my best obey you,
 madam.
  King. Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.
    Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come.
 
   This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet
    Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,
    N
o jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day
    But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
    
And the King's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,
    Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.
    
                            Flourish. Exeunt all but Hamlet.
  Ham. O that this too too solid flesh
 would melt,
    Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!
    Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
 
   His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
    How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
    
Seem to me all the uses of this world!
    Fie on't! ah, fie! 'Tis an unweeded garden
    That gro
ws to seed; things rank and gross in nature
    Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
  
  But two months dead! Nay, not so much, not two.
    So excellent a king, that was to this
    Hy
perion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
    That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
    Vis
it her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
    Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him
    As 
if increase of appetite had grown
    By what it fed on; and yet, within a month-
    Let me not t
hink on't! Frailty, thy name is woman!-
    A little month, or ere those shoes were old
    With w
hich she followed my poor father's body
    Like Niobe, all tears- why she, even she
    (O God! a
 beast that wants discourse of reason
    Would have mourn'd longer) married with my uncle;
    My
 father's brother, but no more like my father
    Than I to Hercules. Within a month,
    Ere yet 
the salt of most unrighteous tears
    Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
    She married. 
O, most wicked speed, to post
    With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
    It is not, nor it 
cannot come to good.
    But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue!

          Enter Horatio,
 Marcellus, and Bernardo.

  Hor. Hail to your lordship!
  Ham. I am glad to see you well.
    H
oratio!- or I do forget myself.
  Hor. The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
  Ham. Sir, 
my good friend- I'll change that name with you.
    And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?
  
  Marcellus?
  Mar. My good lord!
  Ham. I am very glad to see you.- [To Bernardo] Good even, sir.
-

    But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
  Hor. A truant disposition, good my lord.

  Ham. I would not hear your enemy say so,
    Nor shall you do my ear that violence
    To make i
t truster of your own report
    Against yourself. I know you are no truant.
    But what is your 
affair in Elsinore?
    We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
  Hor. My lord, I came to se
e your father's funeral.
  Ham. I prithee do not mock me, fellow student.
    I think it was to se
e my mother's wedding.
  Hor. Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.
  Ham. Thrift, thrift, Horat
io! The funeral bak'd meats
    Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
    Would I had met 
my dearest foe in heaven
    Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
    My father- methinks I see m
y father.
  Hor. O, where, my lord?
  Ham. In my mind's eye, Horatio.
  Hor. I saw him once. He w
as a goodly king.
  Ham. He was a man, take him for all in all.
    I shall not look upon his like
 again.
  Hor. My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
  Ham. Saw? who?
  Hor. My lord, the King 
your father.
  Ham. The King my father?
  Hor. Season your admiration for a while
    With an att
ent ear, till I may deliver
    Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
    This marvel to you.
  Ha
m. For God's love let me hear!
  Hor. Two nights together had these gentlemen
    (Marcellus and B
ernardo) on their watch
    In the dead vast and middle of the night
    Been thus encount'red. A 
figure like your father,
    Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
    Appears before them and with so
lemn march
    Goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walk'd
    By their oppress'd and fear-sur
prised eyes,
    Within his truncheon's length; whilst they distill'd
    Almost to jelly with the
 act of fear,
    Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
    In dreadful secrecy impart they 
did,
    And I with them the third night kept the watch;
    Where, as they had deliver'd, both in
 time,
    Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
    The apparition comes. I knew your 
father.
    These hands are not more like.
  Ham. But where was this?
  Mar. My lord, upon the pl
atform where we watch'd.
  Ham. Did you not speak to it?
  Hor. My lord, I did;
    But answer ma
de it none. Yet once methought
    It lifted up it head and did address
    Itself to motion, like
 as it would speak;
    But even then the morning cock crew loud,
    And at the sound it shrunk i
n haste away
    And vanish'd from our sight.
  Ham. 'Tis very strange.
  Hor. As I do live, my h
onour'd lord, 'tis true;
    And we did think it writ down in our duty
    To let you know of it.

  Ham. Indeed, indeed, sirs. But this troubles me.
    Hold you the watch to-night?
  Both [Mar. 
and Ber.] We do, my lord.
  Ham. Arm'd, say you?
  Both. Arm'd, my lord.
  Ham. From top to toe?

  Both. My lord, from head to foot.
  Ham. Then saw you not his face?
  Hor. O, yes, my lord! He 
wore his beaver up.
  Ham. What, look'd he frowningly.
  Hor. A countenance more in sorrow than in
 anger.
  Ham. Pale or red?
  Hor. Nay, very pale.
  Ham. And fix'd his eyes upon you?
  Hor. Mo
st constantly.
  Ham. I would I had been there.
  Hor. It would have much amaz'd you.
  Ham. Very
 like, very like. Stay'd it long?
  Hor. While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
  Bot
h. Longer, longer.
  Hor. Not when I saw't.
  Ham. His beard was grizzled- no?
  Hor. It was, as 
I have seen it in his life,
    A sable silver'd.
  Ham. I will watch to-night.
    Perchance 'tw
ill walk again.
  Hor. I warr'nt it will.
  Ham. If it assume my noble father's person,
    I'll 
speak to it, though hell itself should gape
    And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
    If y
ou have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
    Let it be tenable in your silence still;
    And whatso
ever else shall hap to-night,
    Give it an understanding but no tongue.
    I will requite your 
loves. So, fare you well.
    Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
    I'll visit you.
  
All. Our duty to your honour.
  Ham. Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell.
                       
                 Exeunt [all but Hamlet].
    My father's spirit- in arms? All is not well.
    I 
doubt some foul play. Would the night were come!
    Till then sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will 
rise,
    Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
Exit.




Scene III.
Elsinore.
 A room in the house of Polonius.

Enter Laertes and Ophelia.

  Laer. My necessaries are embark
'd. Farewell.
    And, sister, as the winds give benefit
    And convoy is assistant, do not sleep
,
    But let me hear from you.
  Oph. Do you doubt that?
  Laer. For Hamlet, and the trifling of
 his favour,
    Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood;
    A violet in the youth of primy nature,

    Forward, not permanent- sweet, not lasting;
    The perfume and suppliance of a minute;
    
No more.
  Oph. No more but so?
  Laer. Think it no more.
    For nature crescent does not grow a
lone
    In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,
    The inward service of the mind and soul

    Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
    And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
   
 The virtue of his will; but you must fear,
    His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
  
  For he himself is subject to his birth.
    He may not, as unvalued persons do,
    Carve for hi
mself, for on his choice depends
    The safety and health of this whole state,
    And therefore 
must his choice be circumscrib'd
    Unto the voice and yielding of that body
    Whereof he is th
e head. Then if he says he loves you,
    It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
    As he in hi
s particular act and place
    May give his saying deed; which is no further
    Than the main voi
ce of Denmark goes withal.
    Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain
    If with too creden
t ear you list his songs,
    Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
    To his unmast'r
ed importunity.
    Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
    And keep you in the rear of you
r affection,
    Out of the shot and danger of desire.
    The chariest maid is prodigal enough
 
   If she unmask her beauty to the moon.
    Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes.
    The 
canker galls the infants of the spring
    Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd,
    And in t
he morn and liquid dew of youth
    Contagious blastments are most imminent.
    Be wary then; bes
t safety lies in fear.
    Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
  Oph. I shall th' effec
t of this good lesson keep
    As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
    Do not as some u
ngracious pastors do,
    Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven,
    Whiles, like a puff'd an
d reckless libertine,
    Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads
    And recks not his own 
rede.
  Laer. O, fear me not!

                       Enter Polonius.

    I stay too long. But
 here my father comes.
    A double blessing is a double grace;
    Occasion smiles upon a second 
leave.
  Pol. Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame!
    The wind sits in the shoulder of y
our sail,
    And you are stay'd for. There- my blessing with thee!
    And these few precepts in 
thy memory
    Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
    Nor any unproportion'd though
t his act.
    Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar:
    Those friends thou hast, and their ad
option tried,
    Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel;
    But do not dull thy palm wit
h entertainment
    Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware
    Of entrance to a quarrel; b
ut being in,
    Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee.
    Give every man thine ear, but few
 thy voice;
    Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
    Costly thy habit as thy pur
se can buy,
    But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
    For the apparel oft proclaims the
 man,
    And they in France of the best rank and station
    Are most select and generous, chief 
in that.
    Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
    For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
 
   And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
    This above all- to thine own self be true,
    A
nd it must follow, as the night the day,
    Thou canst not then be false to any man.
    Farewell
. My blessing season this in thee!
  Laer. Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
  Pol. The tim
e invites you. Go, your servants tend.
  Laer. Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well
    What I hav
e said to you.
  Oph. 'Tis in my memory lock'd,
    And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
  
Laer. Farewell.                                          Exit.
  Pol. What is't, Ophelia, he hath s
aid to you?
  Oph. So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
  Pol. Marry, well bethought
!
    'Tis told me he hath very oft of late
    Given private time to you, and you yourself
    H
ave of your audience been most free and bounteous.
    If it be so- as so 'tis put on me,
    And 
that in way of caution- I must tell you
    You do not understand yourself so clearly
    As it be
hooves my daughter and your honour.
    What is between you? Give me up the truth.
  Oph. He hath,
 my lord, of late made many tenders
    Of his affection to me.
  Pol. Affection? Pooh! You speak 
like a green girl,
    Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
    Do you believe his tenders, as 
you call them?
  Oph. I do not know, my lord, what I should think,
  Pol. Marry, I will teach you!
 Think yourself a baby
    That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
    Which are not sterl
ing. Tender yourself more dearly,
    Or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
    Running it
 thus) you'll tender me a fool.
  Oph. My lord, he hath importun'd me with love
    In honourable 
fashion.
  Pol. Ay, fashion you may call it. Go to, go to!
  Oph. And hath given countenance to hi
s speech, my lord,
    With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
  Pol. Ay, springes to catch woodc
ocks! I do know,
    When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
    Lends the tongue vows. These 
blazes, daughter,
    Giving more light than heat, extinct in both
    Even in their promise, as i
t is a-making,
    You must not take for fire. From this time
    Be something scanter of your mai
den presence.
    Set your entreatments at a higher rate
    Than a command to parley. For Lord Ha
mlet,
    Believe so much in him, that he is young,
    And with a larger tether may he walk
    
Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia,
    Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
    Not
 of that dye which their investments show,
    But mere implorators of unholy suits,
    Breathing
 like sanctified and pious bawds,
    The better to beguile. This is for all:
    I would not, in 
plain terms, from this time forth
    Have you so slander any moment leisure
    As to give words 
or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
    Look to't, I charge you. Come your ways.
  Oph. I shall obey, my
 lord.
                                                         Exeunt.




Scene IV.
Elsinor
e. The platform before the Castle.

Enter Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus.

  Ham. The air bites 
shrewdly; it is very cold.
  Hor. It is a nipping and an eager air.
  Ham. What hour now?
  Hor. 
I think it lacks of twelve.
  Mar. No, it is struck.
  Hor. Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws 
near the season
    Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
                   A flourish of tru
mpets, and two pieces go off.
    What does this mean, my lord?
  Ham. The King doth wake to-night
 and takes his rouse,
    Keeps wassail, and the swagg'ring upspring reels,
    And, as he drains 
his draughts of Rhenish down,
    The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out
    The triumph of his 
pledge.
  Hor. Is it a custom?
  Ham. Ay, marry, is't;
    But to my mind, though I am native her
e
    And to the manner born, it is a custom
    More honour'd in the breach than the observance.

    This heavy-headed revel east and west
    Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations;
    T
hey clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase
    Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
    From 
our achievements, though perform'd at height,
    The pith and marrow of our attribute.
    So oft
 it chances in particular men
    That, for some vicious mole of nature in them,
    As in their b
irth,- wherein they are not guilty,
    Since nature cannot choose his origin,-
    By the o'ergro
wth of some complexion,
    Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
    Or by some habit 
that too much o'erleavens
    The form of plausive manners, that these men
    Carrying, I say, th
e stamp of one defect,
    Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,
    Their virtues else- be th
ey as pure as grace,
    As infinite as man may undergo-
    Shall in the general censure take cor
ruption
    From that particular fault. The dram of e'il
    Doth all the noble substance often do
ut To his own scandal.

                         Enter Ghost.

  Hor. Look, my lord, it comes!

  Ham. Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
    Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
 
   Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
    Be thy intents wicked or charitable,

    Thou com'st in such a questionable shape
    That I will speak to thee. I'll call thee Hamlet,

    King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me?
    Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell
    Why t
hy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,
    Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre
    Wherei
n we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
    Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws
    To cast thee up aga
in. What may this mean
    That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,
    Revisits thus the g
limpses of the moon,
    Making night hideous, and we fools of nature
    So horridly to shake our
 disposition
    With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
    Say, why is this? wherefore? W
hat should we do?
                                           Ghost beckons Hamlet.
  Hor. It becko
ns you to go away with it,
    As if it some impartment did desire
    To you alone.
  Mar. Look 
with what courteous action
    It waves you to a more removed ground.
    But do not go with it!

  Hor. No, by no means!
  Ham. It will not speak. Then will I follow it.
  Hor. Do not, my lord!

  Ham. Why, what should be the fear?
    I do not set my life at a pin's fee;
    And for my soul,
 what can it do to that,
    Being a thing immortal as itself?
    It waves me forth again. I'll f
ollow it.
  Hor. What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
    Or to the dreadful summit of 
the cliff
    That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
    And there assume some other, horrible f
orm
    Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
    And draw you into madness? Think of it.

    The very place puts toys of desperation,
    Without more motive, into every brain
    That 
looks so many fadoms to the sea
    And hears it roar beneath.
  Ham. It waves me still.
    Go o
n. I'll follow thee.
  Mar. You shall not go, my lord.
  Ham. Hold off your hands!
  Hor. Be rul'
d. You shall not go.
  Ham. My fate cries out
    And makes each petty artire in this body
    As
 hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
                                                [Ghost beckons.]


    Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
    By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets 
me!-
    I say, away!- Go on. I'll follow thee.
                                        Exeunt Gho
st and Hamlet.
  Hor. He waxes desperate with imagination.
  Mar. Let's follow. 'Tis not fit thus 
to obey him.
  Hor. Have after. To what issue will this come?
  Mar. Something is rotten in the st
ate of Denmark.
  Hor. Heaven will direct it.
  Mar. Nay, let's follow him.
                     
                                    Exeunt.




Scene V.
Elsinore. The Castle. Another part of
 the fortifications.

Enter Ghost and Hamlet.

  Ham. Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak! I'll go 
no further.
  Ghost. Mark me.
  Ham. I will.
  Ghost. My hour is almost come,
    When I to sulp
h'rous and tormenting flames
    Must render up myself.
  Ham. Alas, poor ghost!
  Ghost. Pity me
 not, but lend thy serious hearing
    To what I shall unfold.
  Ham. Speak. I am bound to hear.

  Ghost. So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
  Ham. What?
  Ghost. I am thy father's spi
rit,
    Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
    And for the day confin'd to fast in fire
s,
    Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
    Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am
 forbid
    To tell the secrets of my prison house,
    I could a tale unfold whose lightest word

    Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
    Make thy two eyes, like stars, start fro
m their spheres,
    Thy knotted and combined locks to part,
    And each particular hair to stand
 on end
    Like quills upon the fretful porcupine.
    But this eternal blazon must not be
    T
o ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
    If thou didst ever thy dear father love-
  Ham
. O God!
  Ghost. Revenge his foul and most unnatural murther.
  Ham. Murther?
  Ghost. Murther m
ost foul, as in the best it is;
    But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.
  Ham. Haste me to
 know't, that I, with wings as swift
    As meditation or the thoughts of love,
    May sweep to m
y revenge.
  Ghost. I find thee apt;
    And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
    That r
ots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
    Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.
    'Tis 
given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
    A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark
    Is
 by a forged process of my death
    Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth,
    The serpent th
at did sting thy father's life
    Now wears his crown.
  Ham. O my prophetic soul!
    My uncle?

  Ghost. Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
    With witchcraft of his wit, with traitor
ous gifts-
    O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
    So to seduce!- won to his shameful 
lust
    The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.
    O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there,

    From me, whose love was of that dignity
    That it went hand in hand even with the vow
    I 
made to her in marriage, and to decline
    Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
    To tho
se of mine!
    But virtue, as it never will be mov'd,
    Though lewdness court it in a shape of 
heaven,
    So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
    Will sate itself in a celestial bed
  
  And prey on garbage.
    But soft! methinks I scent the morning air.
    Brief let me be. Sleepi
ng within my orchard,
    My custom always of the afternoon,
    Upon my secure hour thy uncle sto
le,
    With juice of cursed hebona in a vial,
    And in the porches of my ears did pour
    The
 leperous distilment; whose effect
    Holds such an enmity with blood of man
    That swift as qu
icksilver it courses through
    The natural gates and alleys of the body,
    And with a sudden v
igour it doth posset
    And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
    The thin and wholesome bloo
d. So did it mine;
    And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
    Most lazar-like, with vile and 
loathsome crust
    All my smooth body.
    Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
    Of life
, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd;
    Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
    Unhous'l
ed, disappointed, unanel'd,
    No reckoning made, but sent to my account
    With all my imperfec
tions on my head.
  Ham. O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
  Ghost. If thou hast nature in 
thee, bear it not.
    Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
    A couch for luxury and damned inces
t.
    But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
    Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
 
   Against thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven,
    And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge

    To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once.
    The glowworm shows the matin to be near
  
  And gins to pale his uneffectual fire.
    Adieu, adieu, adieu! Remember me.                     
 Exit.

  Ham. O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?
    And shall I couple hell? Hold, h
old, my heart!
    And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
    But bear me stiffly up. Remember 
thee?
    Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
    In this distracted globe. Remember th
ee?
    Yea, from the table of my memory
    I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
    All saw
s of books, all forms, all pressures past
    That youth and observation copied there,
    And thy
 commandment all alone shall live
    Within the book and volume of my brain,
    Unmix'd with bas
er matter. Yes, by heaven!
    O most pernicious woman!
    O villain, villain, smiling, damned vi
llain!
    My tables! Meet it is I set it down
    That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain
;
    At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark.        [Writes.]
    So, uncle, there you are. N
ow to my word:
    It is 'Adieu, adieu! Remember me.'
    I have sworn't.
  Hor. (within) My lord
, my lord!

                   Enter Horatio and Marcellus.

  Mar. Lord Hamlet!
  Hor. Heaven 
secure him!
  Ham. So be it!
  Mar. Illo, ho, ho, my lord!
  Ham. Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird,
 come.
  Mar. How is't, my noble lord?
  Hor. What news, my lord?
  Mar. O, wonderful!
  Hor. Go
od my lord, tell it.
  Ham. No, you will reveal it.
  Hor. Not I, my lord, by heaven!
  Mar. Nor 
I, my lord.
  Ham. How say you then? Would heart of man once think it?
    But you'll be secret?

  Both. Ay, by heaven, my lord.
  Ham. There's neer a villain dwelling in all Denmark
    But he's
 an arrant knave.
  Hor. There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
    To tell us this.

  Ham. Why, right! You are in the right!
    And so, without more circumstance at all,
    I hold 
it fit that we shake hands and part;
    You, as your business and desires shall point you,
    Fo
r every man hath business and desire,
    Such as it is; and for my own poor part,
    Look you, I
'll go pray.
  Hor. These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
  Ham. I am sorry they offend 
you, heartily;
    Yes, faith, heartily.
  Hor. There's no offence, my lord.
  Ham. Yes, by Saint
 Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
    And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
    It is an
 honest ghost, that let me tell you.
    For your desire to know what is between us,
    O'ermaste
r't as you may. And now, good friends,
    As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,
    Give me
 one poor request.
  Hor. What is't, my lord? We will.
  Ham. Never make known what you have seen 
to-night.
  Both. My lord, we will not.
  Ham. Nay, but swear't.
  Hor. In faith,
    My lord, n
ot I.
  Mar. Nor I, my lord- in faith.
  Ham. Upon my sword.
  Mar. We have sworn, my lord, alrea
dy.
  Ham. Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.

                 Ghost cries under the stage.

  Gho
st. Swear.
  Ham. Aha boy, say'st thou so? Art thou there, truepenny?
    Come on! You hear this f
ellow in the cellarage.
    Consent to swear.
  Hor. Propose the oath, my lord.
  Ham. Never to s
peak of this that you have seen.
    Swear by my sword.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
  Ham. Hic et u
bique? Then we'll shift our ground.
    Come hither, gentlemen,
    And lay your hands again upon 
my sword.
    Never to speak of this that you have heard:
    Swear by my sword.
  Ghost. [beneat
h] Swear by his sword.
  Ham. Well said, old mole! Canst work i' th' earth so fast?
    A worthy p
ioner! Once more remove, good friends."
  Hor. O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
  Ha
m. And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
    There are more things in heaven and earth, Hora
tio,
    Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
    But come!
    Here, as before, never, so help
 you mercy,
    How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself
    (As I perchance hereafter shall think 
meet
    To put an antic disposition on),
    That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
   
 With arms encumb'red thus, or this head-shake,
    Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
   
 As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'
    Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There b
e, an if they might,'
    Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
    That you know aught of me- thi
s is not to do,
    So grace and mercy at your most need help you,
    Swear.
  Ghost. [beneath] 
Swear.
                                                   [They swear.]
  Ham. Rest, rest, perturb
ed spirit! So, gentlemen,
    With all my love I do commend me to you;
    And what so poor a man 
as Hamlet is
    May do t' express his love and friending to you,
    God willing, shall not lack.
 Let us go in together;
    And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
    The time is out of jo
int. O cursed spite
    That ever I was born to set it right!
    Nay, come, let's go together.
 
                                                        Exeunt.

Act II. Scene I
.
Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius.

Enter Polonius and Reynaldo.

  Pol. Give him thi
s money and these notes, Reynaldo.
  Rey. I will, my lord.
  Pol. You shall do marvell's wisely, g
ood Reynaldo,
    Before You visit him, to make inquire
    Of his behaviour.
  Rey. My lord, I d
id intend it.
  Pol. Marry, well said, very well said. Look you, sir,
    Enquire me first what Da
nskers are in Paris;
    And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
    What company, at w
hat expense; and finding
    By this encompassment and drift of question
    That they do know my 
son, come you more nearer
    Than your particular demands will touch it.
    Take you, as 'twere,
 some distant knowledge of him;
    As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
    And in part h
im.' Do you mark this, Reynaldo?
  Rey. Ay, very well, my lord.
  Pol. 'And in part him, but,' you
 may say, 'not well.
    But if't be he I mean, he's very wild
    Addicted so and so'; and there 
put on him
    What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
    As may dishonour him- take heed 
of that;
    But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips
    As are companions noted and most kno
wn
    To youth and liberty.
  Rey. As gaming, my lord.
  Pol. Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing
, quarrelling,
    Drabbing. You may go so far.
  Rey. My lord, that would dishonour him.
  Pol. 
Faith, no, as you may season it in the charge.
    You must not put another scandal on him,
    Th
at he is open to incontinency.
    That's not my meaning. But breathe his faults so quaintly
    T
hat they may seem the taints of liberty,
    The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
    A savagen
ess in unreclaimed blood,
    Of general assault.
  Rey. But, my good lord-
  Pol. Wherefore shou
ld you do this?
  Rey. Ay, my lord,
    I would know that.
  Pol. Marry, sir, here's my drift,
 
   And I believe it is a fetch of warrant.
    You laying these slight sullies on my son
    As 't
were a thing a little soil'd i' th' working,
    Mark you,
    Your party in converse, him you wou
ld sound,
    Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
    The youth you breathe of guilty, be a
ssur'd
    He closes with you in this consequence:
    'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentlem
an'-
    According to the phrase or the addition
    Of man and country-
  Rey. Very good, my lor
d.
  Pol. And then, sir, does 'a this- 'a does- What was I about to
say?
    By the mass, I was a
bout to say something! Where did I leave?
  Rey. At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,'
 and
    gentleman.'
  Pol. At 'closes in the consequence'- Ay, marry!
    He closes thus: 'I kno
w the gentleman.
    I saw him yesterday, or t'other day,
    Or then, or then, with such or such;
 and, as you say,
    There was 'a gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
    There falling out at ten
nis'; or perchance,
    'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'
    Videlicet, a brothel, or so fo
rth.
    See you now-
    Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth;
    And thus do we of 
wisdom and of reach,
    With windlasses and with assays of bias,
    By indirections find directi
ons out.
    So, by my former lecture and advice,
    Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?

  Rey. My lord, I have.
  Pol. God b' wi' ye, fare ye well!
  Rey. Good my lord!                
                    [Going.]
  Pol. Observe his inclination in yourself.
  Rey. I shall, my lord.

  Pol. And let him ply his music.
  Rey. Well, my lord.
  Pol. Farewell!
                       
                           Exit Reynaldo.

                       Enter Ophelia.

    How now, O
phelia? What's the matter?
  Oph. O my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
  Pol. With what,
 i' th' name of God?
  Oph. My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
    Lord Hamlet, with his doubl
et all unbrac'd,
    No hat upon his head, his stockings foul'd,
    Ungart'red, and down-gyved to
 his ankle;
    Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,
    And with a look so piteous i
n purport
    As if he had been loosed out of hell
    To speak of horrors- he comes before me.
 
 Pol. Mad for thy love?
  Oph. My lord, I do not know,
    But truly I do fear it.
  Pol. What sa
id he?
  Oph. He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
    Then goes he to the length of all his 
arm,
    And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
    He falls to such perusal of my face
   
 As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so.
    At last, a little shaking of mine arm,
    And thrice
 his head thus waving up and down,
    He rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound
    As it did seem
 to shatter all his bulk
    And end his being. That done, he lets me go,
    And with his head ov
er his shoulder turn'd
    He seem'd to find his way without his eyes,
    For out o' doors he wen
t without their help
    And to the last bended their light on me.
  Pol. Come, go with me. I will
 go seek the King.
    This is the very ecstasy of love,
    Whose violent property fordoes itself

    And leads the will to desperate undertakings
    As oft as any passion under heaven
    That
 does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
    What, have you given him any hard words of late?
  Oph.
 No, my good lord; but, as you did command,
    I did repel his letters and denied
    His access 
to me.
  Pol. That hath made him mad.
    I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
    I had
 not quoted him. I fear'd he did but trifle
    And meant to wrack thee; but beshrew my jealousy!

    By heaven, it is as proper to our age
    To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
    As it i
s common for the younger sort
    To lack discretion. Come, go we to the King.
    This must be kn
own; which, being kept close, might move
    More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
    Come.

                                                         Exeunt.

Scene II.
Elsinore. A room in
 the Castle.

Flourish. [Enter King and Queen, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern,
cum aliis.

  King
. Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
    Moreover that we much did long to see you,
    T
he need we have to use you did provoke
    Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
    Of Haml
et's transformation. So I call it,
    Sith nor th' exterior nor the inward man
    Resembles that
 it was. What it should be,
    More than his father's death, that thus hath put him
    So much f
rom th' understanding of himself,
    I cannot dream of. I entreat you both
    That, being of so 
young days brought up with him,
    And since so neighbour'd to his youth and haviour,
    That yo
u vouchsafe your rest here in our court
    Some little time; so by your companies
    To draw him
 on to pleasures, and to gather
    So much as from occasion you may glean,
    Whether aught to u
s unknown afflicts him thus
    That, open'd, lies within our remedy.
  Queen. Good gentlemen, he 
hath much talk'd of you,
    And sure I am two men there are not living
    To whom he more adhere
s. If it will please you
    To show us so much gentry and good will
    As to expend your time wi
th us awhile
    For the supply and profit of our hope,
    Your visitation shall receive such tha
nks
    As fits a king's remembrance.
  Ros. Both your Majesties
    Might, by the sovereign powe
r you have of us,
    Put your dread pleasures more into command
    Than to entreaty.
  Guil. Bu
t we both obey,
    And here give up ourselves, in the full bent,
    To lay our service freely at
 your feet,
    To be commanded.
  King. Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
  Queen. Th
anks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz.
    And I beseech you instantly to visit
    My too muc
h changed son.- Go, some of you,
    And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
  Guil. Heavens ma
ke our presence and our practices
    Pleasant and helpful to him!
  Queen. Ay, amen!
           
      Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, [with some
                                             
       Attendants].

                         Enter Polonius.

  Pol. Th' ambassadors from Norwa
y, my good lord,
    Are joyfully return'd.
  King. Thou still hast been the father of good news.

  Pol. Have I, my lord? Assure you, my good liege,
    I hold my duty as I hold my soul,
    Both
 to my God and to my gracious king;
    And I do think- or else this brain of mine
    Hunts not t
he trail of policy so sure
    As it hath us'd to do- that I have found
    The very cause of Haml
et's lunacy.
  King. O, speak of that! That do I long to hear.
  Pol. Give first admittance to th'
 ambassadors.
    My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
  King. Thyself do grace to them
, and bring them in.
                                                [Exit Polonius.]
    He tells
 me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found
    The head and source of all your son's distemper.
  Queen.
 I doubt it is no other but the main,
    His father's death and our o'erhasty marriage.
  King. W
ell, we shall sift him.

              Enter Polonius, Voltemand, and Cornelius.

    Welcome, m
y good friends.
    Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?
  Volt. Most fair return of gree
tings and desires.
    Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
    His nephew's levies; which to h
im appear'd
    To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack,
    But better look'd into, he truly found

    It was against your Highness; whereat griev'd,
    That so his sickness, age, and impotence

    Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
    On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys,
   
 Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,
    Makes vow before his uncle never more
    To give 
th' assay of arms against your Majesty.
    Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
    Gives him t
hree thousand crowns in annual fee
    And his commission to employ those soldiers,
    So levied 
as before, against the Polack;
    With an entreaty, herein further shown,
                       
                         [Gives a paper.]
    That it might please you to give quiet pass
    Thro
ugh your dominions for this enterprise,
    On such regards of safety and allowance
    As therein
 are set down.
  King. It likes us well;
    And at our more consider'd time we'll read,
    Answ
er, and think upon this business.
    Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour.
    Go to y
our rest; at night we'll feast together.
    Most welcome home!                       Exeunt Ambass
adors.
  Pol. This business is well ended.
    My liege, and madam, to expostulate
    What majes
ty should be, what duty is,
    Why day is day, night is night, and time is time.
    Were nothing
 but to waste night, day, and time.
    Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
    And tedio
usness the limbs and outward flourishes,
    I will be brief. Your noble son is mad.
    Mad call 
I it; for, to define true madness,
    What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
    But let that 
go.
  Queen. More matter, with less art.
  Pol. Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
    That he i
s mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
    And pity 'tis 'tis true. A foolish figure!
    But fare
well it, for I will use no art.
    Mad let us grant him then. And now remains
    That we find ou
t the cause of this effect-
    Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
    For this effect defec
tive comes by cause.
    Thus it remains, and the remainder thus.
    Perpend.
    I have a daugh
ter (have while she is mine),
    Who in her duty and obedience, mark,
    Hath given me this. Now
 gather, and surmise.
                                             [Reads] the letter.
    'To the
 celestial, and my soul's idol, the most beautified
      Ophelia,'-

    That's an ill phrase, a
 vile phrase; 'beautified' is a vile
      phrase.
    But you shall hear. Thus:
                
                                        [Reads.]
    'In her excellent white bosom, these, &c.'
  
Queen. Came this from Hamlet to her?
  Pol. Good madam, stay awhile. I will be faithful.     [Reads
.]


          'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
            Doubt that the sun doth move;
      
    Doubt truth to be a liar;
            But never doubt I love.
      'O dear Ophelia, I am ill 
at these numbers; I have not art
to
    reckon my groans; but that I love thee best, O most best,

believe
    it. Adieu.
      'Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to
him,


HAMLET.'

    This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me;
    And more above, hath his solicit
ings,
    As they fell out by time, by means, and place,
    All given to mine ear.
  King. But h
ow hath she
    Receiv'd his love?
  Pol. What do you think of me?
  King. As of a man faithful a
nd honourable.
  Pol. I would fain prove so. But what might you think,
    When I had seen this ho
t love on the wing
    (As I perceiv'd it, I must tell you that,
    Before my daughter told me), 
what might you,
    Or my dear Majesty your queen here, think,
    If I had play'd the desk or tab
le book,
    Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
    Or look'd upon this love with idle si
ght?
    What might you think? No, I went round to work
    And my young mistress thus I did bespe
ak:
    'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star.
    This must not be.' And then I prescripts ga
ve her,
    That she should lock herself from his resort,
    Admit no messengers, receive no toke
ns.
    Which done, she took the fruits of my advice,
    And he, repulsed, a short tale to make,

    Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
    Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
    The
nce to a lightness, and, by this declension,
    Into the madness wherein now he raves,
    And al
l we mourn for.
  King. Do you think 'tis this?
  Queen. it may be, very like.
  Pol. Hath there 
been such a time- I would fain know that-
    That I have Positively said ''Tis so,'
    When it p
rov'd otherwise.?
  King. Not that I know.
  Pol. [points to his head and shoulder] Take this from
 this, if
this
      be otherwise.
    If circumstances lead me, I will find
    Where truth is 
hid, though it were hid indeed
    Within the centre.
  King. How may we try it further?
  Pol. Y
ou know sometimes he walks for hours together
    Here in the lobby.
  Queen. So he does indeed.

  Pol. At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him.
    Be you and I behind an arras then.
    Ma
rk the encounter. If he love her not,
    And he not from his reason fall'n thereon
    Let me be 
no assistant for a state,
    But keep a farm and carters.
  King. We will try it.

            
     Enter Hamlet, reading on a book.

  Queen. But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading
.
  Pol. Away, I do beseech you, both away
    I'll board him presently. O, give me leave.
      
                 Exeunt King and Queen, [with Attendants].
    How does my good Lord Hamlet?
  Ham
. Well, God-a-mercy.
  Pol. Do you know me, my lord?
  Ham. Excellent well. You are a fishmonger.

  Pol. Not I, my lord.
  Ham. Then I would you were so honest a man.
  Pol. Honest, my lord?
  H
am. Ay, sir. To be honest, as this world goes, is to be one
man
    pick'd out of ten thousand.
 
 Pol. That's very true, my lord.
  Ham. For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god
  
  kissing carrion- Have you a daughter?
  Pol. I have, my lord.
  Ham. Let her not walk i' th' sun
. Conception is a blessing, but
not
    as your daughter may conceive. Friend, look to't.
  Pol. 
[aside] How say you by that? Still harping on my daughter.
Yet
    he knew me not at first. He sai
d I was a fishmonger. He is
far
    gone, far gone! And truly in my youth I suff'red much
extremi
ty
    for love- very near this. I'll speak to him again.- What do
you
    read, my lord?
  Ham.
 Words, words, words.
  Pol. What is the matter, my lord?
  Ham. Between who?
  Pol. I mean, the 
matter that you read, my lord.
  Ham. Slanders, sir; for the satirical rogue says here that old
me
n
    have grey beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes
    purging thick amber and plum
-tree gum; and that they have a
    plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams. All
which
,
    sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I
hold it
    not honesty to have i
t thus set down; for you yourself, sir,
    should be old as I am if, like a crab, you could go bac
kward.

  Pol. [aside] Though this be madness, yet there is a method
in't.-
   Will You walk out
 of the air, my lord?
  Ham. Into my grave?
  Pol. Indeed, that is out o' th' air. [Aside] How pre
gnant
sometimes
    his replies are! a happiness that often madness hits on,
which
    reason an
d sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of.
I
    will leave him and suddenly contrive the
 means of meeting
between
    him and my daughter.- My honourable lord, I will most humbly
take

    my leave of you.
  Ham. You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more
    willingly 
part withal- except my life, except my life, except
my
    life,

                    Enter Rose
ncrantz and Guildenstern.

  Pol. Fare you well, my lord.
  Ham. These tedious old fools!
  Pol.
 You go to seek the Lord Hamlet. There he is.
  Ros. [to Polonius] God save you, sir!
            
                                    Exit [Polonius].

  Guil. My honour'd lord!
  Ros. My most de
ar lord!
  Ham. My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern?
Ah,
    Rosencrantz! Good
 lads, how do ye both?
  Ros. As the indifferent children of the earth.
  Guil. Happy in that we a
re not over-happy.
    On Fortune's cap we are not the very button.
  Ham. Nor the soles of her sh
oe?
  Ros. Neither, my lord.
  Ham. Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her
    fa
vours?
  Guil. Faith, her privates we.
  Ham. In the secret parts of Fortune? O! most true! she is
 a
    strumpet. What news ?
  Ros. None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
  Ham. Then
 is doomsday near! But your news is not true. Let me
    question more in particular. What have you
, my good friends,
    deserved at the hands of Fortune that she sends you to prison
    hither?

  Guil. Prison, my lord?
  Ham. Denmark's a prison.
  Ros. Then is the world one.
  Ham. A goodly
 one; in which there are many confines, wards, and
    dungeons, Denmark being one o' th' worst.
 
 Ros. We think not so, my lord.
  Ham. Why, then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either
goo
d
    or bad but thinking makes it so. To me it is a prison.
  Ros. Why, then your ambition makes 
it one. 'Tis too narrow for
your
    mind.
  Ham. O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and cou
nt myself a
    king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.
  Guil. Which dreams i
ndeed are ambition; for the very substance
of
    the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.

  Ham. A dream itself is but a shadow.
  Ros. Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a qua
lity
that
    it is but a shadow's shadow.
  Ham. Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs a
nd
outstretch'd
    heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we to th' court? for, by
my
    fay, I ca
nnot reason.
  Both. We'll wait upon you.
  Ham. No such matter! I will not sort you with the rest
 of my
    servants; for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most
    dreadfully attended. B
ut in the beaten way of friendship,
what
    make you at Elsinore?
  Ros. To visit you, my lord; 
no other occasion.
  Ham. Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank
you;
    and su
re, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny.
Were
    you not sent for? Is it your own in
clining? Is it a free
    visitation? Come, deal justly with me. Come, come! Nay,
speak.
  Guil. 
What should we say, my lord?
  Ham. Why, anything- but to th' purpose. You were sent for; and
    
there is a kind of confession in your looks, which your
modesties
    have not craft enough to col
our. I know the good King and
Queen
    have sent for you.
  Ros. To what end, my lord?
  Ham. T
hat you must teach me. But let me conjure you by the
rights
    of our fellowship, by the consonan
cy of our youth, by the
    obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear
a
    be
tter proposer could charge you withal, be even and direct
with
    me, whether you were sent for o
r no.
  Ros. [aside to Guildenstern] What say you?
  Ham. [aside] Nay then, I have an eye of you.-
 If you love me,
hold
    not off.
  Guil. My lord, we were sent for.
  Ham. I will tell you why
. So shall my anticipation prevent your
    discovery, and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult
 no
    feather. I have of late- but wherefore I know not- lost all
my
    mirth, forgone all cus
tom of exercises; and indeed, it goes
so
    heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, t
he
earth,
    seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy,
the
    air, look yo
u, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this
majestical
    roof fretted with golden fire- why, it ap
peareth no other
thing
    to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What
a
    p
iece of work is a man! how noble in reason! how infinite in
    faculties! in form and moving how e
xpress and admirable! in
    action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the
    bea
uty of the world, the paragon of animals! And yet to me
what
    is this quintessence of dust? Man
 delights not me- no, nor
woman
    neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.
  Ros. My
 lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.
  Ham. Why did you laugh then, when I said 'Man deli
ghts not me'?
  Ros. To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten
    entertainment t
he players shall receive from you. We coted
them
    on the way, and hither are they coming to off
er you service.
  Ham. He that plays the king shall be welcome- his Majesty shall
    have tribute
 of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil
and
    target; the lover shall not sigh gratis;
 the humorous man
shall
    end his part in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose
    lun
gs are tickle o' th' sere; and the lady shall say her mind
    freely, or the blank verse shall hal
t for't. What players are
    they?
  Ros. Even those you were wont to take such delight in, the

    tragedians of the city.
  Ham. How chances it they travel? Their residence, both in
    reputa
tion and profit, was better both ways.
  Ros. I think their inhibition comes by the means of the la
te
    innovation.
  Ham. Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in
the
    city? 
Are they so follow'd?
  Ros. No indeed are they not.
  Ham. How comes it? Do they grow rusty?
  R
os. Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there
is,
    sir, an eyrie of children, li
ttle eyases, that cry out on the
top
    of question and are most tyrannically clapp'd for't. Thes
e
are now
    the fashion, and so berattle the common stages (so they call
    them) that many we
aring rapiers are afraid of goosequills and
    dare scarce come thither.
  Ham. What, are they ch
ildren? Who maintains 'em? How are they
    escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than th
ey can
    sing? Will they not say afterwards, if they should grow
    themselves to common player
s (as it is most like, if their
means
    are no better), their writers do them wrong to make them

exclaim
    against their own succession.
  Ros. Faith, there has been much to do on both sides;
 and the
nation
    holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy. There was, for
a
    while, no
 money bid for argument unless the poet and the
player
    went to cuffs in the question.
  Ham. 
Is't possible?
  Guil. O, there has been much throwing about of brains.
  Ham. Do the boys carry i
t away?
  Ros. Ay, that they do, my lord- Hercules and his load too.
  Ham. It is not very strange
; for my uncle is King of Denmark,
and
    those that would make mows at him while my father lived
 give
    twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his picture
in
    little. 'Sblood, t
here is something in this more than
natural, if
    philosophy could find it out.

             
        Flourish for the Players.

  Guil. There are the players.
  Ham. Gentlemen, you are welco
me to Elsinore. Your hands, come!
Th'
    appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me

comply
    with you in this garb, lest my extent to the players (which I
    tell you must show f
airly outwards) should more appear like
    entertainment than yours. You are welcome. But my
uncl
e-father
    and aunt-mother are deceiv'd.
  Guil. In what, my dear lord?
  Ham. I am but mad nor
th-north-west. When the wind is southerly
I
    know a hawk from a handsaw.

                   
         Enter Polonius.

  Pol. Well be with you, gentlemen!
  Ham. Hark you, Guildenstern- and 
you too- at each ear a hearer!
    That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling
 
   clouts.
  Ros. Happily he's the second time come to them; for they say an
old
    man is twice
 a child.
  Ham. I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players. Mark
it.-
   You say right, 
sir; a Monday morning; twas so indeed.
  Pol. My lord, I have news to tell you.
  Ham. My lord, I 
have news to tell you. When Roscius was an
actor in
    Rome-
  Pol. The actors are come hither, 
my lord.
  Ham. Buzz, buzz!
  Pol. Upon my honour-
  Ham. Then came each actor on his ass-
  Pol
. The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy,
    history, pastoral, pastoral-comical
, historical-pastoral,
    tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral;
scene
    i
ndividable, or poem unlimited. Seneca cannot be too heavy,
nor
    Plautus too light. For the law 
of writ and the liberty, these
are
    the only men.
  Ham. O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a t
reasure hadst thou!
  Pol. What treasure had he, my lord?
  Ham. Why,

         'One fair daught
er, and no more,
           The which he loved passing well.'

  Pol. [aside] Still on my daughte
r.
  Ham. Am I not i' th' right, old Jephthah?
  Pol. If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a d
aughter that I
    love passing well.
  Ham. Nay, that follows not.
  Pol. What follows then, my 
lord?
  Ham. Why,

           'As by lot, God wot,'

 and then, you know,

           'It cam
e to pass, as most like it was.'

    The first row of the pious chanson will show you more; for

look
    where my abridgment comes.

                     Enter four or five Players.

    You 
are welcome, masters; welcome, all.- I am glad to see
thee
    well.- Welcome, good friends.- O, m
y old friend? Why, thy
face is
    valanc'd since I saw thee last. Com'st' thou to' beard me in
 
   Denmark?- What, my young lady and mistress? By'r Lady, your
    ladyship is nearer to heaven tha
n when I saw you last by the
    altitude of a chopine. Pray God your voice, like a piece of
    u
ncurrent gold, be not crack'd within the ring.- Masters, you
are
    all welcome. We'll e'en to't 
like French falconers, fly at
    anything we see. We'll have a speech straight. Come, give us
a

    taste of your quality. Come, a passionate speech.
  1. Play. What speech, my good lord?
  Ham.
 I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never
acted;
    or if it was, not above once; fo
r the play, I remember,
pleas'd
    not the million, 'twas caviary to the general; but it was (as

I
    receiv'd it, and others, whose judgments in such matters
cried in
    the top of mine) an 
excellent play, well digested in the
scenes,
    set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remem
ber one said
    there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter
savoury,
    nor no matter
 in the phrase that might indict the author of
    affectation; but call'd it an honest method, as 
wholesome as
    sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech
in't
    I chiefly l
ov'd. 'Twas AEneas' tale to Dido, and thereabout
of it
    especially where he speaks of Priam's s
laughter. If it live
in
    your memory, begin at this line- let me see, let me see:

         '
The rugged Pyrrhus, like th' Hyrcanian beast-'

    'Tis not so; it begins with Pyrrhus:

      
   'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
         Black as his purpose, did the night resemble

         When he lay couched in the ominous horse,
         Hath now this dread and black complexi
on smear'd
         With heraldry more dismal. Head to foot
         Now is be total gules, horrid
ly trick'd
         With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
         Bak'd and impasted w
ith the parching streets,
         That lend a tyrannous and a damned light
         To their lord
's murther. Roasted in wrath and fire,
         And thus o'ersized with coagulate gore,
         W
ith eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
         Old grandsire Priam seeks.'

    So, proce
ed you.
  Pol. Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good
     discretion.

  1. 
Play. 'Anon he finds him,
      Striking too short at Greeks. His antique sword,
      Rebellious 
to his arm, lies where it falls,
      Repugnant to command. Unequal match'd,
      Pyrrhus at Pri
am drives, in rage strikes wide;
      But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
      Th' unn
erved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
      Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
      
Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
      Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear. For lo! his sword,

      Which was declining on the milky head
      Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' th' air to stick.

      So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
      And, like a neutral to his will and matter,
  
    Did nothing.
      But, as we often see, against some storm,
      A silence in the heavens, t
he rack stand still,
      The bold winds speechless, and the orb below
      As hush as death- an
on the dreadful thunder
      Doth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
      Aroused vengea
nce sets him new awork;
      And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
      On Mars's armour, forg
'd for proof eterne,
      With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
      Now falls on Priam
.
      Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods,
      In general synod take away her power;

      Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
      And bowl the round nave down the hil
l of heaven,
      As low as to the fiends!

  Pol. This is too long.
  Ham. It shall to the bar
ber's, with your beard.- Prithee say
on.
    He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps. Say
 on;
come to
    Hecuba.

  1. Play. 'But who, O who, had seen the mobled queen-'

  Ham. 'The
 mobled queen'?
  Pol. That's good! 'Mobled queen' is good.

  1. Play. 'Run barefoot up and down
, threat'ning the flames
      With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head
      Where late the diad
em stood, and for a robe,
      About her lank and all o'erteemed loins,
      A blanket, in the a
larm of fear caught up-
      Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd
      'Gainst Fortun
e's state would treason have pronounc'd.
      But if the gods themselves did see her then,
      
When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
      In Mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,
   
   The instant burst of clamour that she made
      (Unless things mortal move them not at all)
  
    Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven
      And passion in the gods.'

  Pol. Look
, whe'r he has not turn'd his colour, and has tears
in's
    eyes. Prithee no more!
  Ham. 'Tis w
ell. I'll have thee speak out the rest of this
soon.-
    Good my lord, will you see the players w
ell bestow'd? Do you
    hear? Let them be well us'd; for they are the abstract and
brief
    chr
onicles of the time. After your death you were better have
a
    bad epitaph than their ill report
 while you live.
  Pol. My lord, I will use them according to their desert.
  Ham. God's bodykins,
 man, much better! Use every man after his
    desert, and who should scape whipping? Use them afte
r your
own
    honour and dignity. The less they deserve, the more merit is
in
    your bounty. 
Take them in.
  Pol. Come, sirs.
  Ham. Follow him, friends. We'll hear a play to-morrow.
       
          Exeunt Polonius and Players [except the First].
    Dost thou hear me, old friend? Can yo
u play 'The Murther of
    Gonzago'?
  1. Play. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. We'll ha't to-morrow night. Y
ou could, for a need, study a
    speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which I would set down
and

    insert in't, could you not?
  1. Play. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Very well. Follow that lord- and 
look you mock him not.
                                            [Exit First Player.]
    My goo
d friends, I'll leave you till night. You are welcome
to
    Elsinore.
  Ros. Good my lord!
  Ha
m. Ay, so, God b' wi' ye!
                            [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
    Now
 I am alone.
    O what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
    Is it not monstrous that this player h
ere,
    But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
    Could force his soul so to his own conceit

    That, from her working, all his visage wann'd,
    Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,

    A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
    With forms to his conceit? And all for noth
ing!
    For Hecuba!
    What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
    That he should weep for her? 
What would he do,
    Had he the motive and the cue for passion
    That I have? He would drown th
e stage with tears
    And cleave the general ear with horrid speech;
    Make mad the guilty and 
appal the free,
    Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed
    The very faculties of eyes and ear
s.
    Yet I,
    A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak
    Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my 
cause,
    And can say nothing! No, not for a king,
    Upon whose property and most dear life
  
  A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
    Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
    Pl
ucks off my beard and blows it in my face?
    Tweaks me by th' nose? gives me the lie i' th' throa
t
    As deep as to the lungs? Who does me this, ha?
    'Swounds, I should take it! for it cannot
 be
    But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall
    To make oppression bitter, or ere this
    I sh
ould have fatted all the region kites
    With this slave's offal. Bloody bawdy villain!
    Remor
seless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
    O, vengeance!
    Why, what an ass am I! Thi
s is most brave,
    That I, the son of a dear father murther'd,
    Prompted to my revenge by hea
ven and hell,
    Must (like a whore) unpack my heart with words
    And fall a-cursing like a ver
y drab,
    A scullion!
    Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! Hum, I have heard
    That guilty c
reatures, sitting at a play,
    Have by the very cunning of the scene
    Been struck so to the s
oul that presently
    They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
    For murther, though it have no
 tongue, will speak
    With most miraculous organ, I'll have these Players
    Play something lik
e the murther of my father
    Before mine uncle. I'll observe his looks;
    I'll tent him to the
 quick. If he but blench,
    I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
    May be a devil; an
d the devil hath power
    T' assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
    Out of my weakness and
 my melancholy,
    As he is very potent with such spirits,
    Abuses me to damn me. I'll have gr
ounds
    More relative than this. The play's the thing
    Wherein I'll catch the conscience of t
he King.         Exit.

ACT III. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

En
ter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern,
and Lords.

  King. And can you by
 no drift of circumstance
    Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
    Grating so harshly a
ll his days of quiet
    With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
  Ros. He does confess he feels hims
elf distracted,
    But from what cause he will by no means speak.
  Guil. Nor do we find him forw
ard to be sounded,
    But with a crafty madness keeps aloof
    When we would bring him on to som
e confession
    Of his true state.
  Queen. Did he receive you well?
  Ros. Most like a gentlema
n.
  Guil. But with much forcing of his disposition.
  Ros. Niggard of question, but of our demand
s
    Most free in his reply.
  Queen. Did you assay him
    To any pastime?
  Ros. Madam, it so
 fell out that certain players
    We o'erraught on the way. Of these we told him,
    And there d
id seem in him a kind of joy
    To hear of it. They are here about the court,
    And, as I think
, they have already order
    This night to play before him.
  Pol. 'Tis most true;
    And he be
seech'd me to entreat your Majesties
    To hear and see the matter.
  King. With all my heart, an
d it doth much content me
    To hear him so inclin'd.
    Good gentlemen, give him a further edge

    And drive his purpose on to these delights.
  Ros. We shall, my lord.
                      
      Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
  King. Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
    For we have c
losely sent for Hamlet hither,
    That he, as 'twere by accident, may here
    Affront Ophelia.

    Her father and myself (lawful espials)
    Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing unseen,
    W
e may of their encounter frankly judge
    And gather by him, as he is behav'd,
    If't be th' af
fliction of his love, or no,
    That thus he suffers for.
  Queen. I shall obey you;
    And for
 your part, Ophelia, I do wish
    That your good beauties be the happy cause
    Of Hamlet's wild
ness. So shall I hope your virtues
    Will bring him to his wonted way again,
    To both your ho
nours.
  Oph. Madam, I wish it may.
                                                   [Exit Queen
.]
  Pol. Ophelia, walk you here.- Gracious, so please you,
    We will bestow ourselves.- [To Oph
elia] Read on this book,
    That show of such an exercise may colour
    Your loneliness.- We are
 oft to blame in this,
    'Tis too much prov'd, that with devotion's visage
    And pious action 
we do sugar o'er
    The Devil himself.
  King. [aside] O, 'tis too true!
    How smart a lash th
at speech doth give my conscience!
    The harlot's cheek, beautied with plast'ring art,
    Is no
t more ugly to the thing that helps it
    Than is my deed to my most painted word.
    O heavy bu
rthen!
  Pol. I hear him coming. Let's withdraw, my lord.
                                      Ex
eunt King and Polonius].

                           Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. To be, or not to be- 
that is the question:
    Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
    The slings and arrows of o
utrageous fortune
    Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
    And by opposing end them. To 
die- to sleep-
    No more; and by a sleep to say we end
    The heartache, and the thousand natur
al shocks
    That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation
    Devoutly to be wish'd. To die- to sle
ep.
    To sleep- perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub!
    For in that sleep of death what dre
ams may come
    When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
    Must give us pause. There's the r
espect
    That makes calamity of so long life.
    For who would bear the whips and scorns of tim
e,
    Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
    The pangs of despis'd love, the law's
 delay,
    The insolence of office, and the spurns
    That patient merit of th' unworthy takes,

    When he himself might his quietus make
    With a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear,

    To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
    But that the dread of something after death-
    Th
e undiscover'd country, from whose bourn
    No traveller returns- puzzles the will,
    And makes
 us rather bear those ills we have
    Than fly to others that we know not of?
    Thus conscience
 does make cowards of us all,
    And thus the native hue of resolution
    Is sicklied o'er with 
the pale cast of thought,
    And enterprises of great pith and moment
    With this regard their 
currents turn awry
    And lose the name of action.- Soft you now!
    The fair Ophelia!- Nymph, i
n thy orisons
    Be all my sins rememb'red.
  Oph. Good my lord,
    How does your honour for th
is many a day?
  Ham. I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
  Oph. My lord, I have remembrances of
 yours
    That I have longed long to re-deliver.
    I pray you, now receive them.
  Ham. No, no
t I!
    I never gave you aught.
  Oph. My honour'd lord, you know right well you did,
    And wi
th them words of so sweet breath compos'd
    As made the things more rich. Their perfume lost,
  
  Take these again; for to the noble mind
    Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
    Th
ere, my lord.
  Ham. Ha, ha! Are you honest?
  Oph. My lord?
  Ham. Are you fair?
  Oph. What me
ans your lordship?
  Ham. That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit
no
    discou
rse to your beauty.
  Oph. Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with
honesty?
  Ham. 
Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform
    honesty from what it is to a bawd than
 the force of honesty
can
    translate beauty into his likeness. This was sometime a
paradox,
 
   but now the time gives it proof. I did love you once.
  Oph. Indeed, my lord, you made me believ
e so.
  Ham. You should not have believ'd me; for virtue cannot so
    inoculate our old stock but
 we shall relish of it. I loved
you
    not.
  Oph. I was the more deceived.
  Ham. Get thee to 
a nunnery! Why wouldst thou be a breeder of
    sinners? I am myself indifferent honest, but yet I 
could
accuse
    me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne
me.
    I am very
 proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more offences at
my
    beck than I have thoughts to put them 
in, imagination to give
    them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows
as I
   
 do, crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves
all;
    believe none of us. Go thy w
ays to a nunnery. Where's your
    father?
  Oph. At home, my lord.
  Ham. Let the doors be shut 
upon him, that he may play the fool
    nowhere but in's own house. Farewell.
  Oph. O, help him, 
you sweet heavens!
  Ham. If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy
dowry:
    be th
ou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not
escape
    calumny. Get thee to a nunnery. Go
, farewell. Or if thou wilt
    needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what
    
monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go; and quickly too.
    Farewell.
  Oph. O heavenly powe
rs, restore him!
  Ham. I have heard of your paintings too, well enough. God hath
    given you on
e face, and you make yourselves another. You jig,
you
    amble, and you lisp; you nickname God's 
creatures and make
your
    wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't! it hath
made
  
  me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages. Those that are
    married already- all but one- s
hall live; the rest shall keep
as
    they are. To a nunnery, go.                            Exit.

  Oph. O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
    The courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, to
ngue, sword,
    Th' expectancy and rose of the fair state,
    The glass of fashion and the mould
 of form,
    Th' observ'd of all observers- quite, quite down!
    And I, of ladies most deject a
nd wretched,
    That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
    Now see that noble and most sovereig
n reason,
    Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
    That unmatch'd form and feature
 of blown youth
    Blasted with ecstasy. O, woe is me
    T' have seen what I have seen, see what
 I see!

                   Enter King and Polonius.

  King. Love? his affections do not that w
ay tend;
    Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,
    Was not like madness. There's 
something in his soul
    O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
    And I do doubt the hatch an
d the disclose
    Will be some danger; which for to prevent,
    I have in quick determination
 
   Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England
    For the demand of our neglected tribute.
 
   Haply the seas, and countries different,
    With variable objects, shall expel
    This someth
ing-settled matter in his heart,
    Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
    From fashi
on of himself. What think you on't?
  Pol. It shall do well. But yet do I believe
    The origin a
nd commencement of his grief
    Sprung from neglected love.- How now, Ophelia?
    You need not t
ell us what Lord Hamlet said.
    We heard it all.- My lord, do as you please;
    But if you hold
 it fit, after the play
    Let his queen mother all alone entreat him
    To show his grief. Let 
her be round with him;
    And I'll be plac'd so please you, in the ear
    Of all their conferenc
e. If she find him not,
    To England send him; or confine him where
    Your wisdom best shall t
hink.
  King. It shall be so.
    Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.         Exeunt.





Scene II.
Elsinore. hall in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet and three of the Players.

  Ham. S
peak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounc'd it to you,
    trippingly on the tongue. But if you mo
uth it, as many of our
    players do, I had as live the town crier spoke my lines. Nor
do
    no
t saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all
    gently; for in the very torrent, tempe
st, and (as I may say)
    whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and beget a
    temperance 
that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to
the
    soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated f
ellow tear a passion
to
    tatters, to very rags, to split the cars of the groundlings,
who
   
 (for the most part) are capable of nothing but inexplicable
dumb
    shows and noise. I would hav
e such a fellow whipp'd for
o'erdoing
    Termagant. It out-herods Herod. Pray you avoid it.
  Pl
ayer. I warrant your honour.
  Ham. Be not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be
your

    tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the action;
with
    this special observance, 
that you o'erstep not the modesty of
    nature: for anything so overdone is from the purpose of
p
laying,
    whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as
    'twere, the mirror u
p to nature; to show Virtue her own
feature,
    scorn her own image, and the very age and body of
 the time
his
    form and pressure. Now this overdone, or come tardy off,
though
    it make th
e unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious
    grieve; the censure of the which one must in y
our allowance
    o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that
I
    have seen p
lay, and heard others praise, and that highly (not
to
    speak it profanely), that, neither havin
g the accent of
    Christians, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have
so
    strutted a
nd bellowed that I have thought some of Nature's
    journeymen had made men, and not made them wel
l, they
imitated
    humanity so abominably.
  Player. I hope we have reform'd that indifferently
 with us,
sir.
  Ham. O, reform it altogether! And let those that play your
clowns
    speak no 
more than is set down for them. For there be of them
    that will themselves laugh, to set on some
 quantity of barren
    spectators to laugh too, though in the mean time some
necessary
    quest
ion of the play be then to be considered. That's
villanous
    and shows a most pitiful ambition i
n the fool that uses it.
Go
    make you ready.
                                                 
Exeunt Players.

            Enter Polonius, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.

    How now, my lor
d? Will the King hear this piece of work?
  Pol. And the Queen too, and that presently.
  Ham. Bid
 the players make haste, [Exit Polonius.] Will you two
    help to hasten them?
  Both. We will, m
y lord.                       Exeunt they two.
  Ham. What, ho, Horatio!

                      E
nter Horatio.

  Hor. Here, sweet lord, at your service.
  Ham. Horatio, thou art e'en as just a 
man
    As e'er my conversation cop'd withal.
  Hor. O, my dear lord!
  Ham. Nay, do not think I 
flatter;
    For what advancement may I hope from thee,
    That no revenue hast but thy good spir
its
    To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
    No, let the candied tongue 
lick absurd pomp,
    And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
    Where thrift may follow fawnin
g. Dost thou hear?
    Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
    And could of men distingu
ish, her election
    Hath seal'd thee for herself. For thou hast been
    As one, in suff'ring al
l, that suffers nothing;
    A man that Fortune's buffets and rewards
    Hast ta'en with equal th
anks; and blest are those
    Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled
    That they are no
t a pipe for Fortune's finger
    To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
    That is not 
passion's slave, and I will wear him
    In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
    As I do
 thee. Something too much of this I
    There is a play to-night before the King.
    One scene of
 it comes near the circumstance,
    Which I have told thee, of my father's death.
    I prithee, 
when thou seest that act afoot,
    Even with the very comment of thy soul
    Observe my uncle. I
f his occulted guilt
    Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
    It is a damned ghost that we ha
ve seen,
    And my imaginations are as foul
    As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
    F
or I mine eyes will rivet to his face,
    And after we will both our judgments join
    In censur
e of his seeming.
  Hor. Well, my lord.
    If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
  
  And scape detecting, I will pay the theft.

    Sound a flourish. [Enter Trumpets and Kettledrum
s. Danish
    march. [Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz,
      Guildenstern, and o
ther Lords attendant, with the Guard
                       carrying torches.

  Ham. They are co
ming to the play. I must be idle.
    Get you a place.
  King. How fares our cousin Hamlet?
  Ham
. Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish. I eat the
air,
    promise-cramm'd. You cannot fee
d capons so.
  King. I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet. These words are
not
    mine.
  Ha
m. No, nor mine now. [To Polonius] My lord, you play'd once
    i' th' university, you say?
  Pol.
 That did I, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.
  Ham. What did you enact?
  Pol. I did enac
t Julius Caesar; I was kill'd i' th' Capitol;
Brutus
    kill'd me.
  Ham. It was a brute part of
 him to kill so capital a calf
there. Be
    the players ready.
  Ros. Ay, my lord. They stay upo
n your patience.
  Queen. Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
  Ham. No, good mother. Here's m
etal more attractive.
  Pol. [to the King] O, ho! do you mark that?
  Ham. Lady, shall I lie in yo
ur lap?
                                  [Sits down at Ophelia's feet.]

  Oph. No, my lord.
  
Ham. I mean, my head upon your lap?
  Oph. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Do you think I meant country matter
s?
  Oph. I think nothing, my lord.
  Ham. That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
  Op
h. What is, my lord?
  Ham. Nothing.
  Oph. You are merry, my lord.
  Ham. Who, I?
  Oph. Ay, my
 lord.
  Ham. O God, your only jig-maker! What should a man do but be
merry?
    For look you how
 cheerfully my mother looks, and my father
died
    within 's two hours.
  Oph. Nay 'tis twice tw
o months, my lord.
  Ham. So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I'll have
a
    suit o
f sables. O heavens! die two months ago, and not
forgotten
    yet? Then there's hope a great man'
s memory may outlive his
life
    half a year. But, by'r Lady, he must build churches then; or
el
se
    shall he suffer not thinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose

    epitaph is 'For O, for O
, the hobby-horse is forgot!'

               Hautboys play. The dumb show enters.

    Enter a 
King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing
    him and he her. She kneels, and makes show 
of protestation
    unto him. He takes her up, and declines his head upon her
    neck. He lays hi
m down upon a bank of flowers. She, seeing
    him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, take
s off his
    crown, kisses it, pours poison in the sleeper's ears, and
    leaves him. The Queen 
returns, finds the King dead, and makes
    passionate action. The Poisoner with some three or four

Mutes,
    comes in again, seem to condole with her. The dead body is
    carried away. The Pois
oner wooes the Queen with gifts; she
    seems harsh and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts

    his love.
                                                         Exeunt.

  Oph. What means
 this, my lord?
  Ham. Marry, this is miching malhecho; it means mischief.
  Oph. Belike this show
 imports the argument of the play.

                      Enter Prologue.

  Ham. We shall know 
by this fellow. The players cannot keep
counsel;
    they'll tell all.
  Oph. Will he tell us wha
t this show meant?
  Ham. Ay, or any show that you'll show him. Be not you asham'd
to
    show, h
e'll not shame to tell you what it means.
  Oph. You are naught, you are naught! I'll mark the play
.

    Pro. For us, and for our tragedy,
      Here stooping to your clemency,
      We beg your
 hearing patiently.                     [Exit.]

  Ham. Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?

  Oph. 'Tis brief, my lord.
  Ham. As woman's love.

              Enter [two Players as] King 
and Queen.

    King. Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round
      Neptune's salt wash a
nd Tellus' orbed ground,
      And thirty dozen moons with borrowed sheen
      About the world ha
ve times twelve thirties been,
      Since love our hearts, and Hymen did our hands,
      Unite c
omutual in most sacred bands.
    Queen. So many journeys may the sun and moon
      Make us again
 count o'er ere love be done!
      But woe is me! you are so sick of late,
      So far from chee
r and from your former state.
      That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
      Discomfort 
you, my lord, it nothing must;
      For women's fear and love holds quantity,
      In neither au
ght, or in extremity.
      Now what my love is, proof hath made you know;
      And as my love is
 siz'd, my fear is so.
      Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
      Where little
 fears grow great, great love grows there.
    King. Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly to
o;
      My operant powers their functions leave to do.
      And thou shalt live in this fair wor
ld behind,
      Honour'd, belov'd, and haply one as kind
      For husband shalt thou-
    Queen
. O, confound the rest!
      Such love must needs be treason in my breast.
      When second husb
and let me be accurst!
      None wed the second but who killed the first.

  Ham. [aside] Wormwo
od, wormwood!

    Queen. The instances that second marriage move
      Are base respects of thri
ft, but none of love.
      A second time I kill my husband dead
      When second husband kisses 
me in bed.
    King. I do believe you think what now you speak;
      But what we do determine oft
 we break.
      Purpose is but the slave to memory,
      Of violent birth, but poor validity;
 
     Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree,
      But fall unshaken when they mellow be.

      Most necessary 'tis that we forget
      To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt.
     
 What to ourselves in passion we propose,
      The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
      T
he violence of either grief or joy
      Their own enactures with themselves destroy.
      Where 
joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
      Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
     
 This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
      That even our loves should with our fortunes
 change;
      For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
      Whether love lead fortune, or else 
fortune love.
      The great man down, you mark his favourite flies,
      The poor advanc'd make
s friends of enemies;
      And hitherto doth love on fortune tend,
      For who not needs shall 
never lack a friend,
      And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
      Directly seasons him hi
s enemy.
      But, orderly to end where I begun,
      Our wills and fates do so contrary run
  
    That our devices still are overthrown;
      Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own.

      So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
      But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is
 dead.
    Queen. Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light,
      Sport and repose lock from me
 day and night,
      To desperation turn my trust and hope,
      An anchor's cheer in prison be 
my scope,
      Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
      Meet what I would have well, and i
t destroy,
      Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
      If, once a widow, ever I be w
ife!

  Ham. If she should break it now!

    King. 'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhi
le.
      My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile
      The tedious day with sleep.
    Qu
een. Sleep rock thy brain,
                                                    [He] sleeps.
      
And never come mischance between us twain!
Exit.

  Ham. Madam, how like you this play?
  Queen.
 The lady doth protest too much, methinks.
  Ham. O, but she'll keep her word.
  King. Have you he
ard the argument? Is there no offence in't?
  Ham. No, no! They do but jest, poison in jest; no off
ence i'
th'
    world.
  King. What do you call the play?
  Ham. 'The Mousetrap.' Marry, how? Tr
opically. This play is the
    image of a murther done in Vienna. Gonzago is the duke's
name;
   
 his wife, Baptista. You shall see anon. 'Tis a knavish piece
of
    work; but what o' that? Your 
Majesty, and we that have free
    souls, it touches us not. Let the gall'd jade winch; our
wither
s
    are unwrung.

                         Enter Lucianus.

    This is one Lucianus, nephew 
to the King.
  Oph. You are as good as a chorus, my lord.
  Ham. I could interpret between you and
 your love, if I could
see
    the puppets dallying.
  Oph. You are keen, my lord, you are keen.

  Ham. It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
  Oph. Still better, and worse.
  Ham. S
o you must take your husbands.- Begin, murtherer. Pox,
leave
    thy damnable faces, and begin! Co
me, the croaking raven doth
    bellow for revenge.

    Luc. Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fi
t, and time agreeing;
      Confederate season, else no creature seeing;
      Thou mixture rank, 
of midnight weeds collected,
      With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,
      Thy na
tural magic and dire property
      On wholesome life usurp immediately.
                         
          Pours the poison in his ears.

  Ham. He poisons him i' th' garden for's estate. His nam
e's
Gonzago.
    The story is extant, and written in very choice Italian. You
    shall see anon 
how the murtherer gets the love of Gonzago's
wife.
  Oph. The King rises.
  Ham. What, frighted w
ith false fire?
  Queen. How fares my lord?
  Pol. Give o'er the play.
  King. Give me some light
! Away!
  All. Lights, lights, lights!
                              Exeunt all but Hamlet and Hor
atio.
  Ham.   Why, let the strucken deer go weep,
          The hart ungalled play;
         For
 some must watch, while some must sleep:
          Thus runs the world away.
    Would not this, s
ir, and a forest of feathers- if the rest of
my
    fortunes turn Turk with me-with two Provincial
 roses on my
raz'd
    shoes, get me a fellowship in a cry of players, sir?
  Hor. Half a share.

  Ham.   A whole one I!
         For thou dost know, O Damon dear,
           This realm dismantl
ed was
         Of Jove himself; and now reigns here
           A very, very- pajock.
  Hor. You 
might have rhym'd.
  Ham. O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand
    pound! Did
st perceive?
  Hor. Very well, my lord.
  Ham. Upon the talk of the poisoning?
  Hor. I did very 
well note him.
  Ham.   Aha! Come, some music! Come, the recorders!
         For if the King like 
not the comedy,
         Why then, belike he likes it not, perdy.
    Come, some music!

       
         Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Guil. Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.

  Ham. Sir, a whole history.
  Guil. The King, sir-
  Ham. Ay, sir, what of him?
  Guil. Is in h
is retirement, marvellous distemper'd.
  Ham. With drink, sir?
  Guil. No, my lord; rather with ch
oler.
  Ham. Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this
to
    the doctor; for me
 to put him to his purgation would perhaps
    plunge him into far more choler.
  Guil. Good my lo
rd, put your discourse into some frame, and
start
    not so wildly from my affair.
  Ham. I am t
ame, sir; pronounce.
  Guil. The Queen, your mother, in most great affliction of
spirit
    hath 
sent me to you.
  Ham. You are welcome.
  Guil. Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the rig
ht
breed.
    If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, I will
do
    your mother's 
commandment; if not, your pardon and my return
    shall be the end of my business.
  Ham. Sir, I 
cannot.
  Guil. What, my lord?
  Ham. Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseas'd. But, sir,
s
uch
    answer as I can make, you shall command; or rather, as you
say,
    my mother. Therefore 
no more, but to the matter! My mother,
you
    say-
  Ros. Then thus she says: your behaviour hat
h struck her into
    amazement and admiration.
  Ham. O wonderful son, that can so stonish a moth
er! But is
there no
    sequel at the heels of this mother's admiration? Impart.
  Ros. She desir
es to speak with you in her closet ere you go to
bed.
  Ham. We shall obey, were she ten times our
 mother. Have you any
    further trade with us?
  Ros. My lord, you once did love me.
  Ham. And
 do still, by these pickers and stealers!
  Ros. Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? You
 do
surely
    bar the door upon your own liberty, if you deny your griefs
to
    your friend.

  Ham. Sir, I lack advancement.
  Ros. How can that be, when you have the voice of the King
himsel
f
    for your succession in Denmark?
  Ham. Ay, sir, but 'while the grass grows'- the proverb is

something
    musty.

                     Enter the Players with recorders.

    O, the recor
ders! Let me see one. To withdraw with you- why
do
    you go about to recover the wind of me, as 
if you would drive
me
    into a toil?
  Guil. O my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too

unmannerly.
  Ham. I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this
pipe?
  Guil. My lord,
 I cannot.
  Ham. I pray you.
  Guil. Believe me, I cannot.
  Ham. I do beseech you.
  Guil. I k
now, no touch of it, my lord.
  Ham. It is as easy as lying. Govern these ventages with your
    f
ingers and thumbs, give it breath with your mouth, and it
will
    discourse most eloquent music. 
Look you, these are the stops.
  Guil. But these cannot I command to any utt'rance of harmony. I
 
   have not the skill.
  Ham. Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me!
You
    wou
ld play upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you
would
    pluck out the heart of my mystery;
 you would sound me from my
    lowest note to the top of my compass; and there is much
music,
  
  excellent voice, in this little organ, yet cannot you make it
    speak. 'Sblood, do you think I 
am easier to be play'd on than
a
    pipe? Call me what instrument you will, though you can fret

me,
    you cannot play upon me.

                        Enter Polonius.

    God bless you, s
ir!
  Pol. My lord, the Queen would speak with you, and presently.
  Ham. Do you see yonder cloud 
that's almost in shape of a camel?
  Pol. By th' mass, and 'tis like a camel indeed.
  Ham. Methin
ks it is like a weasel.
  Pol. It is back'd like a weasel.
  Ham. Or like a whale.
  Pol. Very li
ke a whale.
  Ham. Then will I come to my mother by-and-by.- They fool me to
the
    top of my be
nt.- I will come by-and-by.
  Pol. I will say so.                                      Exit.
  Ham
. 'By-and-by' is easily said.- Leave me, friends.
                                        [Exeunt a
ll but Hamlet.]

    'Tis now the very witching time of night,
    When churchyards yawn, and hel
l itself breathes out
    Contagion to this world. Now could I drink hot blood
    And do such bit
ter business as the day
    Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother!
    O heart, lose not 
thy nature; let not ever
    The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom.
    Let me be cruel, not unna
tural;
    I will speak daggers to her, but use none.
    My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites
-
    How in my words somever she be shent,
    To give them seals never, my soul, consent!       
      Exit.




Scene III.
A room in the Castle.

Enter King, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.


  King. I like him not, nor stands it safe with us
    To let his madness range. Therefore prep
are you;
    I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
    And he to England shall along with you
.
    The terms of our estate may not endure
    Hazard so near us as doth hourly grow
    Out of
 his lunacies.
  Guil. We will ourselves provide.
    Most holy and religious fear it is
    To k
eep those many many bodies safe
    That live and feed upon your Majesty.
  Ros. The single and pe
culiar life is bound
    With all the strength and armour of the mind
    To keep itself from noya
nce; but much more
    That spirit upon whose weal depends and rests
    The lives of many. The ce
sse of majesty
    Dies not alone, but like a gulf doth draw
    What's near it with it. It is a m
assy wheel,
    Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,
    To whose huge spokes ten thousand le
sser things
    Are mortis'd and adjoin'd; which when it falls,
    Each small annexment, petty co
nsequence,
    Attends the boist'rous ruin. Never alone
    Did the king sigh, but with a general 
groan.
  King. Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;
    For we will fetters put upon this f
ear,
    Which now goes too free-footed.
  Both. We will haste us.
                              
                 Exeunt Gentlemen.

                   Enter Polonius.

  Pol. My lord, he's goi
ng to his mother's closet.
    Behind the arras I'll convey myself
    To hear the process. I'll w
arrant she'll tax him home;
    And, as you said, and wisely was it said,
    'Tis meet that some 
more audience than a mother,
    Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear
    The speech, 
of vantage. Fare you well, my liege.
    I'll call upon you ere you go to bed
    And tell you wha
t I know.
  King. Thanks, dear my lord.
                                                Exit [Polo
nius].
    O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven;
    It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,

    A brother's murther! Pray can I not,
    Though inclination be as sharp as will.
    My stro
nger guilt defeats my strong intent,
    And, like a man to double business bound,
    I stand in 
pause where I shall first begin,
    And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
    Were thicker t
han itself with brother's blood,
    Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
    To wash it 
white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
    But to confront the visage of offence?
    And what's in p
rayer but this twofold force,
    To be forestalled ere we come to fall,
    Or pardon'd being dow
n? Then I'll look up;
    My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer
    Can serve my turn? 'Fo
rgive me my foul murther'?
    That cannot be; since I am still possess'd
    Of those effects for
 which I did the murther-
    My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.
    May one be pardon'd a
nd retain th' offence?
    In the corrupted currents of this world
    Offence's gilded hand may s
hove by justice,
    And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
    Buys out the law; but 'tis not 
so above.
    There is no shuffling; there the action lies
    In his true nature, and we ourselve
s compell'd,
    Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
    To give in evidence. What then?
 What rests?
    Try what repentance can. What can it not?
    Yet what can it when one cannot rep
ent?
    O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
    O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,

    Art more engag'd! Help, angels! Make assay.
    Bow, stubborn knees; and heart with strings of
 steel,
    Be soft as sinews of the new-born babe!
    All may be well.                          
        He kneels.

                         Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Now might I do it pat, now he
 is praying;
    And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven,
    And so am I reveng'd. That would
 be scann'd.
    A villain kills my father; and for that,
    I, his sole son, do this same villai
n send
    To heaven.
    Why, this is hire and salary, not revenge!
    He took my father grossl
y, full of bread,
    With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
    And how his audit stan
ds, who knows save heaven?
    But in our circumstance and course of thought,
    'Tis heavy with 
him; and am I then reveng'd,
    To take him in the purging of his soul,
    When he is fit and se
asoned for his passage?
    No.
    Up, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent.
    When he is d
runk asleep; or in his rage;
    Or in th' incestuous pleasure of his bed;
    At gaming, swearing
, or about some act
    That has no relish of salvation in't-
    Then trip him, that his heels ma
y kick at heaven,
    And that his soul may be as damn'd and black
    As hell, whereto it goes. M
y mother stays.
    This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.              Exit.
  King. [rises] M
y words fly up, my thoughts remain below.
    Words without thoughts never to heaven go.           
  Exit.




Scene IV.
The Queen's closet.

Enter Queen and Polonius.

  Pol. He will come 
straight. Look you lay home to him.
    Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,
    
And that your Grace hath screen'd and stood between
    Much heat and him. I'll silence me even her
e.
    Pray you be round with him.
  Ham. (within) Mother, mother, mother!
  Queen. I'll warrant 
you; fear me not. Withdraw; I hear him
coming.
                              [Polonius hides behin
d the arras.]

                          Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Now, mother, what's the matter?

  Queen. Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
  Ham. Mother, you have my father much offende
d.
  Queen. Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
  Ham. Go, go, you question with a wicked 
tongue.
  Queen. Why, how now, Hamlet?
  Ham. What's the matter now?
  Queen. Have you forgot me?

  Ham. No, by the rood, not so!
    You are the Queen, your husband's brother's wife,
    And (w
ould it were not so!) you are my mother.
  Queen. Nay, then I'll set those to you that can speak.

  Ham. Come, come, and sit you down. You shall not budge;
    You go not till I set you up a glass

    Where you may see the inmost part of you.
  Queen. What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murther me
?
    Help, help, ho!
  Pol. [behind] What, ho! help, help, help!
  Ham. [draws] How now? a rat? 
Dead for a ducat, dead!
            [Makes a pass through the arras and] kills Polonius.
  Pol. [b
ehind] O, I am slain!
  Queen. O me, what hast thou done?
  Ham. Nay, I know not. Is it the King?

  Queen. O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
  Ham. A bloody deed- almost as bad, good mother,

    As kill a king, and marry with his brother.
  Queen. As kill a king?
  Ham. Ay, lady, it was
 my word.
                         [Lifts up the arras and sees Polonius.]
    Thou wretched, rash
, intruding fool, farewell!
    I took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune.
    Thou find'st to 
be too busy is some danger.
    Leave wringing of your hands. Peace! sit you down
    And let me w
ring your heart; for so I shall
    If it be made of penetrable stuff;
    If damned custom have n
ot braz'd it so
    That it is proof and bulwark against sense.
  Queen. What have I done that tho
u dar'st wag thy tongue
    In noise so rude against me?
  Ham. Such an act
    That blurs the gr
ace and blush of modesty;
    Calls virtue hypocrite; takes off the rose
    From the fair forehea
d of an innocent love,
    And sets a blister there; makes marriage vows
    As false as dicers' o
aths. O, such a deed
    As from the body of contraction plucks
    The very soul, and sweet relig
ion makes
    A rhapsody of words! Heaven's face doth glow;
    Yea, this solidity and compound ma
ss,
    With tristful visage, as against the doom,
    Is thought-sick at the act.
  Queen. Ah me
, what act,
    That roars so loud and thunders in the index?
  Ham. Look here upon th's picture, 
and on this,
    The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
    See what a grace was seated on t
his brow;
    Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
    An eye like Mars, to threaten and c
ommand;
    A station like the herald Mercury
    New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill:
    A com
bination and a form indeed
    Where every god did seem to set his seal
    To give the world assu
rance of a man.
    This was your husband. Look you now what follows.
    Here is your husband, li
ke a mildew'd ear
    Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
    Could you on this fair mo
untain leave to feed,
    And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes
    You cannot call it love; 
for at your age
    The heyday in the blood is tame, it's humble,
    And waits upon the judgment;
 and what judgment
    Would step from this to this? Sense sure you have,
    Else could you not h
ave motion; but sure that sense
    Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,
    Nor sense to ecst
acy was ne'er so thrall'd
    But it reserv'd some quantity of choice
    To serve in such a diffe
rence. What devil was't
    That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
    Eyes without feeling,
 feeling without sight,
    Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
    Or but a sickly par
t of one true sense
    Could not so mope.
    O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
    
If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
    To flaming youth let virtue be as wax
    And melt i
n her own fire. Proclaim no shame
    When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
    Since frost
 itself as actively doth burn,
    And reason panders will.
  Queen. O Hamlet, speak no more!
   
 Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul,
    And there I see such black and grained spots
    As
 will not leave their tinct.
  Ham. Nay, but to live
    In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
  
  Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love
    Over the nasty sty!
  Queen. O, speak to me n
o more!
    These words like daggers enter in mine ears.
    No more, sweet Hamlet!
  Ham. A murt
herer and a villain!
    A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
    Of your precedent lord; 
a vice of kings;
    A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
    That from a shelf the precious dia
dem stole
    And put it in his pocket!
  Queen. No more!

                Enter the Ghost in hi
s nightgown.

  Ham. A king of shreds and patches!-
    Save me and hover o'er me with your wings
,
    You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?
  Queen. Alas, he's mad!
  Ham. Do yo
u not come your tardy son to chide,
    That, laps'd in time and passion, lets go by
    Th' impor
tant acting of your dread command?
    O, say!
  Ghost. Do not forget. This visitation
    Is but
 to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
    But look, amazement on thy mother sits.
    O, step betwe
en her and her fighting soul
    Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works.
    Speak to her, Haml
et.
  Ham. How is it with you, lady?
  Queen. Alas, how is't with you,
    That you do bend your 
eye on vacancy,
    And with th' encorporal air do hold discourse?
    Forth at your eyes your spi
rits wildly peep;
    And, as the sleeping soldiers in th' alarm,
    Your bedded hairs, like life
 in excrements,
    Start up and stand an end. O gentle son,
    Upon the heat and flame of thy di
stemper
    Sprinkle cool patience! Whereon do you look?
  Ham. On him, on him! Look you how pale 
he glares!
    His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
    Would make them capable.- Do
 not look upon me,
    Lest with this piteous action you convert
    My stern effects. Then what I
 have to do
    Will want true colour- tears perchance for blood.
  Queen. To whom do you speak th
is?
  Ham. Do you see nothing there?
  Queen. Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
  Ham. Nor d
id you nothing hear?
  Queen. No, nothing but ourselves.
  Ham. Why, look you there! Look how it s
teals away!
    My father, in his habit as he liv'd!
    Look where he goes even now out at the po
rtal!
                                                     Exit Ghost.
  Queen. This is the very c
oinage of your brain.
    This bodiless creation ecstasy
    Is very cunning in.
  Ham. Ecstasy?

    My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time
    And makes as healthful music. It is not madne
ss
    That I have utt'red. Bring me to the test,
    And I the matter will reword; which madness

    Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
    Lay not that flattering unction to your soul

    That not your trespass but my madness speaks.
    It will but skin and film the ulcerous plac
e,
    Whiles rank corruption, mining all within,
    Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;

    Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
    And do not spread the compost on the weeds
   
 To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;
    For in the fatness of these pursy times
    V
irtue itself of vice must pardon beg-
    Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.
  Queen. O H
amlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
  Ham. O, throw away the worser part of it,
    And live
 the purer with the other half,
    Good night- but go not to my uncle's bed.
    Assume a virtue,
 if you have it not.
    That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat
    Of habits evil, is angel
 yet in this,
    That to the use of actions fair and good
    He likewise gives a frock or livery
,
    That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,
    And that shall lend a kind of easiness
    To t
he next abstinence; the next more easy;
    For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
    And
 either [master] the devil, or throw him out
    With wondrous potency. Once more, good night;
   
 And when you are desirous to be blest,
    I'll blessing beg of you.- For this same lord,
    I d
o repent; but heaven hath pleas'd it so,
    To punish me with this, and this with me,
    That I 
must be their scourge and minister.
    I will bestow him, and will answer well
    The death I ga
ve him. So again, good night.
    I must be cruel, only to be kind;
    Thus bad begins, and worse
 remains behind.
    One word more, good lady.
  Queen. What shall I do?
  Ham. Not this, by no m
eans, that I bid you do:
    Let the bloat King tempt you again to bed;
    Pinch wanton on your c
heek; call you his mouse;
    And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
    Or paddling in your ne
ck with his damn'd fingers,
    Make you to ravel all this matter out,
    That I essentially am n
ot in madness,
    But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;
    For who that's but a queen,
 fair, sober, wise,
    Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib
    Such dear concernings hide? Wh
o would do so?
    No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
    Unpeg the basket on the house's top,

    Let the birds fly, and like the famous ape,
    To try conclusions, in the basket creep
    An
d break your own neck down.
  Queen. Be thou assur'd, if words be made of breath,
    And breath o
f life, I have no life to breathe
    What thou hast said to me.
  Ham. I must to England; you kno
w that?
  Queen. Alack,
    I had forgot! 'Tis so concluded on.
  Ham. There's letters seal'd; an
d my two schoolfellows,
    Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,
    They bear the mandate; 
they must sweep my way
    And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
    For 'tis the sport to have 
the enginer
    Hoist with his own petar; and 't shall go hard
    But I will delve one yard below
 their mines
    And blow them at the moon. O, 'tis most sweet
    When in one line two crafts dir
ectly meet.
    This man shall set me packing.
    I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.-
  
  Mother, good night.- Indeed, this counsellor
    Is now most still, most secret, and most grave,

    Who was in life a foolish peating knave.
    Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.
    G
ood night, mother.
                  [Exit the Queen. Then] Exit Hamlet, tugging in
              
                                         Polonius.

ACT IV. Scene I.
Elsinore. 
A room in the Castle.

Enter King and Queen, with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  King. There's
 matter in these sighs. These profound heaves
    You must translate; 'tis fit we understand them.

    Where is your son?
  Queen. Bestow this place on us a little while.
                         
 [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
    Ah, mine own lord, what have I seen to-night!
  King. 
What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
  Queen. Mad as the sea and wind when both contend
    Which is t
he mightier. In his lawless fit
    Behind the arras hearing something stir,
    Whips out his rap
ier, cries 'A rat, a rat!'
    And in this brainish apprehension kills
    The unseen good old man
.
  King. O heavy deed!
    It had been so with us, had we been there.
    His liberty is full of
 threats to all-
    To you yourself, to us, to every one.
    Alas, how shall this bloody deed be
 answer'd?
    It will be laid to us, whose providence
    Should have kept short, restrain'd, and
 out of haunt
    This mad young man. But so much was our love
    We would not understand what wa
s most fit,
    But, like the owner of a foul disease,
    To keep it from divulging, let it feed

    Even on the pith of life. Where is he gone?
  Queen. To draw apart the body he hath kill'd;
 
   O'er whom his very madness, like some ore
    Among a mineral of metals base,
    Shows itself 
pure. He weeps for what is done.
  King. O Gertrude, come away!
    The sun no sooner shall the mo
untains touch
    But we will ship him hence; and this vile deed
    We must with all our majesty 
and skill
    Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!

             Enter Rosencrantz and 
Guildenstern.

    Friends both, go join you with some further aid.
    Hamlet in madness hath Po
lonius slain,
    And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him.
    Go seek him out; speak fai
r, and bring the body
    Into the chapel. I pray you haste in this.
                          Exe
unt [Rosencrantz and Guildenstern].
    Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends
    And l
et them know both what we mean to do
    And what's untimely done. [So haply slander-]
    Whose w
hisper o'er the world's diameter,
    As level as the cannon to his blank,
    Transports his pois
oned shot- may miss our name
    And hit the woundless air.- O, come away!
    My soul is full of 
discord and dismay.
                                                         Exeunt.




Scene
 II.
Elsinore. A passage in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Safely stow'd.
  Gentlemen. (wi
thin) Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!
  Ham. But soft! What noise? Who calls on Hamlet? O, here they
come.


               Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Ros. What have you done, my lord, with the 
dead body?
  Ham. Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
  Ros. Tell us where 'tis, that we ma
y take it thence
    And bear it to the chapel.
  Ham. Do not believe it.
  Ros. Believe what?
 
 Ham. That I can keep your counsel, and not mine own. Besides,
to be
    demanded of a sponge, wha
t replication should be made by the
son
    of a king?
  Ros. Take you me for a sponge, my lord?

  Ham. Ay, sir; that soaks up the King's countenance, his
rewards,
    his authorities. But such 
officers do the King best service
in
    the end. He keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his

jaw;
    first mouth'd, to be last swallowed. When he needs what you
have
    glean'd, it is bu
t squeezing you and, sponge, you shall be
dry
    again.
  Ros. I understand you not, my lord.
 
 Ham. I am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.
  Ros. My lord, you must tell us w
here the body is and go with us
to
    the King.
  Ham. The body is with the King, but the King i
s not with the
body.
    The King is a thing-
  Guil. A thing, my lord?
  Ham. Of nothing. Bring
 me to him. Hide fox, and all after.
                                                         Exeun
t.




Scene III.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King.

  King. I have sent to see
k him and to find the body.
    How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
    Yet must not we 
put the strong law on him.
    He's lov'd of the distracted multitude,
    Who like not in their j
udgment, but their eyes;
    And where 'tis so, th' offender's scourge is weigh'd,
    But never t
he offence. To bear all smooth and even,
    This sudden sending him away must seem
    Deliberate
 pause. Diseases desperate grown
    By desperate appliance are reliev'd,
    Or not at all.

  
                  Enter Rosencrantz.

    How now O What hath befall'n?
  Ros. Where the dead bod
y is bestow'd, my lord,
    We cannot get from him.
  King. But where is he?
  Ros. Without, my l
ord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
  King. Bring him before us.
  Ros. Ho, Guildenstern! Bring i
n my lord.

        Enter Hamlet and Guildenstern [with Attendants].

  King. Now, Hamlet, where
's Polonius?
  Ham. At supper.
  King. At supper? Where?
  Ham. Not where he eats, but where he i
s eaten. A certain
    convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your worm is
your
    only e
mperor for diet. We fat all creatures else to fat us,
and
    we fat ourselves for maggots. Your f
at king and your lean
beggar
    is but variable service- two dishes, but to one table. That's
th
e
    end.
  King. Alas, alas!
  Ham. A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and

eat
    of the fish that hath fed of that worm.
  King. What dost thou mean by this?
  Ham. Nothi
ng but to show you how a king may go a progress
through
    the guts of a beggar.
  King. Where i
s Polonius?
  Ham. In heaven. Send thither to see. If your messenger find him
not
    there, seek
 him i' th' other place yourself. But indeed, if
you
    find him not within this month, you shall
 nose him as you go
up
    the stair, into the lobby.
  King. Go seek him there. [To Attendants.]

  Ham. He will stay till you come.
                                            [Exeunt Attendants
.]
  King. Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,-
    Which we do tender as we dearly grie
ve
    For that which thou hast done,- must send thee hence
    With fiery quickness. Therefore pr
epare thyself.
    The bark is ready and the wind at help,
    Th' associates tend, and everything
 is bent
    For England.
  Ham. For England?
  King. Ay, Hamlet.
  Ham. Good.
  King. So is it
, if thou knew'st our purposes.
  Ham. I see a cherub that sees them. But come, for England!
    F
arewell, dear mother.
  King. Thy loving father, Hamlet.
  Ham. My mother! Father and mother is ma
n and wife; man and wife
is
    one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England!
Exit.
  King. F
ollow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard.
    Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night.
  
  Away! for everything is seal'd and done
    That else leans on th' affair. Pray you make haste.

                            Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]
    And, England, if my love thou 
hold'st at aught,-
    As my great power thereof may give thee sense,
    Since yet thy cicatrice 
looks raw and red
    After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
    Pays homage to us,- thou mayst 
not coldly set
    Our sovereign process, which imports at full,
    By letters congruing to that 
effect,
    The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;
    For like the hectic in my blood he ra
ges,
    And thou must cure me. Till I know 'tis done,
    Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er beg
un.             Exit.

Scene IV.
Near Elsinore.

Enter Fortinbras with his Ar
my over the stage.

  For. Go, Captain, from me greet the Danish king.
    Tell him that by his l
icense Fortinbras
    Craves the conveyance of a promis'd march
    Over his kingdom. You know the
 rendezvous.
    If that his Majesty would aught with us,
    We shall express our duty in his eye
;
    And let him know so.
  Capt. I will do't, my lord.
  For. Go softly on.
                  
                 Exeunt [all but the Captain].

       Enter Hamlet, Rosencrantz, [Guildenstern,] 
and others.

  Ham. Good sir, whose powers are these?
  Capt. They are of Norway, sir.
  Ham. Ho
w purpos'd, sir, I pray you?
  Capt. Against some part of Poland.
  Ham. Who commands them, sir?

  Capt. The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.
  Ham. Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
    
Or for some frontier?
  Capt. Truly to speak, and with no addition,
    We go to gain a little pat
ch of ground
    That hath in it no profit but the name.
    To pay five ducats, five, I would not
 farm it;
    Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
    A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.

  Ham. Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
  Capt. Yes, it is already garrison'd.
  Ham. 
Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
    Will not debate the question of this straw.
    
This is th' imposthume of much wealth and peace,
    That inward breaks, and shows no cause without

    Why the man dies.- I humbly thank you, sir.
  Capt. God b' wi' you, sir.                     
        [Exit.]
  Ros. Will't please you go, my lord?
  Ham. I'll be with you straight. Go a littl
e before.
                                        [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]
    How all occasions d
o inform against me
    And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
    If his chief good and market 
of his time
    Be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.
    Sure he that made us with such lar
ge discourse,
    Looking before and after, gave us not
    That capability and godlike reason
  
  To fust in us unus'd. Now, whether it be
    Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple
    Of thi
nking too precisely on th' event,-
    A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
    An
d ever three parts coward,- I do not know
    Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do,'
    Sith
 I have cause, and will, and strength, and means
    To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me.
 
   Witness this army of such mass and charge,
    Led by a delicate and tender prince,
    Whose s
pirit, with divine ambition puff'd,
    Makes mouths at the invisible event,
    Exposing what is 
mortal and unsure
    To all that fortune, death, and danger dare,
    Even for an eggshell. Right
ly to be great
    Is not to stir without great argument,
    But greatly to find quarrel in a str
aw
    When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,
    That have a father kill'd, a mother stain
'd,
    Excitements of my reason and my blood,
    And let all sleep, while to my shame I see
   
 The imminent death of twenty thousand men
    That for a fantasy and trick of fame
    Go to thei
r graves like beds, fight for a plot
    Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
    Which is no
t tomb enough and continent
    To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,
    My thoughts be blo
ody, or be nothing worth!            Exit.

Scene V.
Elsinore. A room in the Ca
stle.

Enter Horatio, Queen, and a Gentleman.

  Queen. I will not speak with her.
  Gent. She 
is importunate, indeed distract.
    Her mood will needs be pitied.
  Queen. What would she have?

  Gent. She speaks much of her father; says she hears
    There's tricks i' th' world, and hems, a
nd beats her heart;
    Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,
    That carry but hal
f sense. Her speech is nothing,
    Yet the unshaped use of it doth move
    The hearers to collec
tion; they aim at it,
    And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;
    Which, as her wink
s and nods and gestures yield them,
    Indeed would make one think there might be thought,
    Th
ough nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
  Hor. 'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew

    Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.
  Queen. Let her come in.
                       
                        [Exit Gentleman.]
    [Aside] To my sick soul (as sin's true nature is)
  
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
    So full of artless jealousy is guilt
    It spi
lls itself in fearing to be spilt.

                 Enter Ophelia distracted.

  Oph. Where is 
the beauteous Majesty of Denmark?
  Queen. How now, Ophelia?
  Oph. (sings)
         How should I
 your true-love know
           From another one?
         By his cockle bat and' staff
         
  And his sandal shoon.

  Queen. Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
  Oph. Say you? Nay, 
pray You mark.

    (Sings) He is dead and gone, lady,
              He is dead and gone;
      
      At his head a grass-green turf,
              At his heels a stone.

    O, ho!
  Queen. N
ay, but Ophelia-
  Oph. Pray you mark.

    (Sings) White his shroud as the mountain snow-

   
                 Enter King.

  Queen. Alas, look here, my lord!
  Oph. (Sings)
           Larde
d all with sweet flowers;
         Which bewept to the grave did not go
           With true-love 
showers.

  King. How do you, pretty lady?
  Oph. Well, God dild you! They say the owl was a bake
r's
daughter.
    Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be. God
be at
    your tab
le!
  King. Conceit upon her father.
  Oph. Pray let's have no words of this; but when they ask, y
ou
what
    it means, say you this:

    (Sings) To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,
          
    All in the morning bedtime,
            And I a maid at your window,
              To be your 
Valentine.

            Then up he rose and donn'd his clo'es
              And dupp'd the chambe
r door,
            Let in the maid, that out a maid
              Never departed more.

  King.
 Pretty Ophelia!
  Oph. Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't!

    [Sings] By Gis a
nd by Saint Charity,
              Alack, and fie for shame!
            Young men will do't if th
ey come to't
              By Cock, they are to blame.

            Quoth she, 'Before you tumble
d me,
              You promis'd me to wed.'

    He answers:

            'So would I 'a' done
, by yonder sun,
              An thou hadst not come to my bed.'

  King. How long hath she been
 thus?
  Oph. I hope all will be well. We must be patient; but I cannot
    choose but weep to thi
nk they would lay him i' th' cold
ground.
    My brother shall know of it; and so I thank you for 
your good
    counsel. Come, my coach! Good night, ladies. Good night,
sweet
    ladies. Good nig
ht, good night.                         Exit
  King. Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray 
you.
                                                 [Exit Horatio.]

    O, this is the poison 
of deep grief; it springs
    All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
    When sorrows 
come, they come not single spies.
    But in battalions! First, her father slain;
    Next, your s
on gone, and he most violent author
    Of his own just remove; the people muddied,
    Thick and 
and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers
    For good Polonius' death, and we have done but g
reenly
    In hugger-mugger to inter him; poor Ophelia
    Divided from herself and her fair judgm
ent,
    Without the which we are pictures or mere beasts;
    Last, and as much containing as all
 these,
    Her brother is in secret come from France;
    And wants not buzzers to infect his ear

    Feeds on his wonder, keep, himself in clouds,
    With pestilent speeches of his father's dea
th,
    Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
    Will nothing stick our person to arraign
    I
n ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
    Like to a murd'ring piece, in many places
    Give me
 superfluous death.                  A noise within.
  Queen. Alack, what noise is this?
  King. W
here are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.

                     Enter a Messenger.

    Wha
t is the matter?
  Mess. Save Yourself, my lord:
    The ocean, overpeering of his list,
    Eats
 not the flats with more impetuous haste
    Than Young Laertes, in a riotous head,
    O'erbears 
Your offices. The rabble call him lord;
    And, as the world were now but to begin,
    Antiquity
 forgot, custom not known,
    The ratifiers and props of every word,
    They cry 'Choose we! Lae
rtes shall be king!'
    Caps, hands, and tongues applaud it to the clouds,
    'Laertes shall be 
king! Laertes king!'
                                                 A noise within.
  Queen. How
 cheerfully on the false trail they cry!
    O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!
  King. Th
e doors are broke.

                    Enter Laertes with others.

  Laer. Where is this king?-
 Sirs, staid you all without.
  All. No, let's come in!
  Laer. I pray you give me leave.
  All. 
We will, we will!
  Laer. I thank you. Keep the door.      [Exeunt his Followers.]
    O thou vile
 king,
    Give me my father!
  Queen. Calmly, good Laertes.
  Laer. That drop of blood that's ca
lm proclaims me bastard;
    Cries cuckold to my father; brands the harlot
    Even here between t
he chaste unsmirched brows
    Of my true mother.
  King. What is the cause, Laertes,
    That th
y rebellion looks so giantlike?
    Let him go, Gertrude. Do not fear our person.
    There's such
 divinity doth hedge a king
    That treason can but peep to what it would,
    Acts little of his
 will. Tell me, Laertes,
    Why thou art thus incens'd. Let him go, Gertrude.
    Speak, man.
  
Laer. Where is my father?
  King. Dead.
  Queen. But not by him!
  King. Let him demand his fill.

  Laer. How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
    To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackes
t devil
    Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
    I dare damnation. To this point I st
and,
    That both the world, I give to negligence,
    Let come what comes; only I'll be reveng'd

    Most throughly for my father.
  King. Who shall stay you?
  Laer. My will, not all the world
!
    And for my means, I'll husband them so well
    They shall go far with little.
  King. Good
 Laertes,
    If you desire to know the certainty
    Of your dear father's death, is't writ in yo
ur revenge
    That sweepstake you will draw both friend and foe,
    Winner and loser?
  Laer. N
one but his enemies.
  King. Will you know them then?
  Laer. To his good friends thus wide I'll o
pe my arms
    And, like the kind life-rend'ring pelican,
    Repast them with my blood.
  King. 
Why, now You speak
    Like a good child and a true gentleman.
    That I am guiltless of your fat
her's death,
    And am most sensibly in grief for it,
    It shall as level to your judgment pier
ce
    As day does to your eye.
                              A noise within: 'Let her come in.'

  Laer. How now? What noise is that?

                      Enter Ophelia.

    O heat, dry up m
y brains! Tears seven times salt
    Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!
    By heaven, thy
 madness shall be paid by weight
    Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!
    Dear maid, k
ind sister, sweet Ophelia!
    O heavens! is't possible a young maid's wits
    Should be as morta
l as an old man's life?
    Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,
    It sends some preciou
s instance of itself
    After the thing it loves.

  Oph. (sings)
         They bore him barefa
c'd on the bier
           (Hey non nony, nony, hey nony)
         And in his grave rain'd many a 
tear.

    Fare you well, my dove!
  Laer. Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
    
It could not move thus.
  Oph. You must sing 'A-down a-down, and you call him a-down-a.'
O,
    h
ow the wheel becomes it! It is the false steward, that stole
his
    master's daughter.
  Laer. T
his nothing's more than matter.
  Oph. There's rosemary, that's for remembrance. Pray you, love,
 
   remember. And there is pansies, that's for thoughts.
  Laer. A document in madness! Thoughts and
 remembrance fitted.
  Oph. There's fennel for you, and columbines. There's rue for
you,
    and 
here's some for me. We may call it herb of grace o'
Sundays.
    O, you must wear your rue with a 
difference! There's a daisy.
I
    would give you some violets, but they wither'd all when my
fat
her
    died. They say he made a good end.

    [Sings] For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.

 
 Laer. Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,
    She turns to favour and to prettiness.
  
Oph. (sings)
         And will he not come again?
         And will he not come again?
          
 No, no, he is dead;
           Go to thy deathbed;
         He never will come again.

        
 His beard was as white as snow,
         All flaxen was his poll.
           He is gone, he is go
ne,
           And we cast away moan.
         God 'a'mercy on his soul!

    And of all Christi
an souls, I pray God. God b' wi' you.
Exit.
  Laer. Do you see this, O God?
  King. Laertes, I mu
st commune with your grief,
    Or you deny me right. Go but apart,
    Make choice of whom your w
isest friends you will,
    And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me.
    If by direct or b
y collateral hand
    They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,
    Our crown, our life, and
 all that we call ours,
    To you in satisfaction; but if not,
    Be you content to lend your pa
tience to us,
    And we shall jointly labour with your soul
    To give it due content.
  Laer. 
Let this be so.
    His means of death, his obscure funeral-
    No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o
'er his bones,
    No noble rite nor formal ostentation,-
    Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heav
en to earth,
    That I must call't in question.
  King. So you shall;
    And where th' offence 
is let the great axe fall.
    I pray you go with me.
                                            
              Exeunt

Scene VI.
Elsinore. Another room in the Castle.

Enter 
Horatio with an Attendant.

  Hor. What are they that would speak with me?
  Servant. Seafaring m
en, sir. They say they have letters for
you.
  Hor. Let them come in.
                           
                    [Exit Attendant.]
    I do not know from what part of the world
    I should b
e greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.

                          Enter Sailors.

  Sailor. God ble
ss you, sir.
  Hor. Let him bless thee too.
  Sailor. 'A shall, sir, an't please him. There's a le
tter for
you,
    sir,- it comes from th' ambassador that was bound for
England- if
    your nam
e be Horatio, as I am let to know it is.
  Hor. (reads the letter) 'Horatio, when thou shalt have

overlook'd
    this, give these fellows some means to the King. They have
    letters for him. Ere
 we were two days old at sea, a pirate of

    very warlike appointment gave us chase. Finding our
selves too
    slow of sail, we put on a compelled valour, and in the
grapple I
    boarded them.
 On the instant they got clear of our ship; so I
    alone became their prisoner. They have dealt w
ith me like
thieves
    of mercy; but they knew what they did: I am to do a good turn
for
    th
em. Let the King have the letters I have sent, and repair
thou
    to me with as much speed as tho
u wouldst fly death. I have
words
    to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb; yet are they much

too
    light for the bore of the matter. These good fellows will
bring
    thee where I am. Ro

course

    Come, I will give 
you way for these your letters,

Scene VII.
Elsinore. Another r
oom in the Castle.

Enter King and Laertes.

  King. Now must your conscience my acquittance sea
l,
    And You must put me in your heart for friend,
    Sith you have heard, and with a knowing e
ar,
    That he which hath your noble father slain
    Pursued my life.
  Laer. It well appears. 
But tell me
    Why you proceeded not against these feats
    So crimeful and so capital in nature
,
    As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
    You mainly were stirr'd up.
  King. O, for 
two special reasons,
    Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,
    But yet to me they ar
e strong. The Queen his mother
    Lives almost by his looks; and for myself,-
    My virtue or my
 plague, be it either which,-
    She's so conjunctive to my life and soul
    That, as the star m
oves not but in his sphere,
    I could not but by her. The other motive
    Why to a public count
 I might not go
    Is the great love the general gender bear him,
    Who, dipping all his faults
 in their affection,
    Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
    Convert his gives 
to graces; so that my arrows,
    Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,
    Would have reverte
d to my bow again,
    And not where I had aim'd them.
  Laer. And so have I a noble father lost;

    A sister driven into desp'rate terms,
    Whose worth, if praises may go back again,
    Stoo
d challenger on mount of all the age
    For her perfections. But my revenge will come.
  King. Br
eak not your sleeps for that. You must not think
    That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
  
  That we can let our beard be shook with danger,
    And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear 
more.
    I lov'd your father, and we love ourself,
    And that, I hope, will teach you to imagin
e-

                 Enter a Messenger with letters.

    How now? What news?
  Mess. Letters, 
my lord, from Hamlet:
    This to your Majesty; this to the Queen.
  King. From Hamlet? Who brough
t them?
  Mess. Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not.
    They were given me by Claudio; he 
receiv'd them
    Of him that brought them.
  King. Laertes, you shall hear them.
    Leave us.

                                                 Exit Messenger.
    [Reads]'High and Mighty,-You s
hall know I am set naked on
your
    kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes;

    when I shall (first asking your pardon thereunto) recount the
    occasion of my sudden and m
ore strange return.
                                                     'HAMLET.'
    What should
 this mean? Are all the rest come back?
    Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?
  Laer. Know y
ou the hand?
  King. 'Tis Hamlet's character. 'Naked!'
    And in a postscript here, he says 'alon
e.'
    Can you advise me?
  Laer. I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come!
    It warms the v
ery sickness in my heart
    That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,
    'Thus didest thou.'

  King. If it be so, Laertes
    (As how should it be so? how otherwise?),
    Will you be rul'd 
by me?
  Laer. Ay my lord,
    So you will not o'errule me to a peace.
  King. To thine own peace
. If he be now return'd
    As checking at his voyage, and that he means
    No more to undertake 
it, I will work him
    To exploit now ripe in my device,
    Under the which he shall not choose 
but fall;
    And for his death no wind shall breathe
    But even his mother shall uncharge the p
ractice
    And call it accident.
  Laer. My lord, I will be rul'd;
    The rather, if you could 
devise it so
    That I might be the organ.
  King. It falls right.
    You have been talk'd of s
ince your travel much,
    And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality
    Wherein they say you sh
ine, Your sum of parts
    Did not together pluck such envy from him
    As did that one; and that
, in my regard,
    Of the unworthiest siege.
  Laer. What part is that, my lord?
  King. A very 
riband in the cap of youth-
    Yet needfull too; for youth no less becomes
    The light and care
less livery that it wears
    Than settled age his sables and his weeds,
    Importing health and 
graveness. Two months since
    Here was a gentleman of Normandy.
    I have seen myself, and serv
'd against, the French,
    And they can well on horseback; but this gallant
    Had witchcraft in
't. He grew unto his seat,
    And to such wondrous doing brought his horse
    As had he been inc
orps'd and demi-natur'd
    With the brave beast. So far he topp'd my thought
    That I, in forge
ry of shapes and tricks,
    Come short of what he did.
  Laer. A Norman was't?
  King. A Norman.

  Laer. Upon my life, Lamound.
  King. The very same.
  Laer. I know him well. He is the broach 
indeed
    And gem of all the nation.
  King. He made confession of you;
    And gave you such a 
masterly report
    For art and exercise in your defence,
    And for your rapier most especially,

    That he cried out 'twould be a sight indeed
    If one could match you. The scrimers of their
 nation
    He swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
    If you oppos'd them. Sir, this report
 of his
    Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
    That he could nothing do but wish and beg
   
 Your sudden coming o'er to play with you.
    Now, out of this-
  Laer. What out of this, my lord
?
  King. Laertes, was your father dear to you?
    Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
   
 A face without a heart,'
  Laer. Why ask you this?
  King. Not that I think you did not love your
 father;
    But that I know love is begun by time,
    And that I see, in passages of proof,
   
 Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
    There lives within the very flame of love
    A kind
 of wick or snuff that will abate it;
    And nothing is at a like goodness still;
    For goodnes
s, growing to a plurisy,
    Dies in his own too-much. That we would do,
    We should do when we 
would; for this 'would' changes,
    And hath abatements and delays as many
    As there are tongu
es, are hands, are accidents;
    And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
    That hurt
s by easing. But to the quick o' th' ulcer!
    Hamlet comes back. What would you undertake
    To
 show yourself your father's son in deed
    More than in words?
  Laer. To cut his throat i' th' 
church!
  King. No place indeed should murther sanctuarize;
    Revenge should have no bounds. But
, good Laertes,
    Will you do this? Keep close within your chamber.
    Hamlet return'd shall kn
ow you are come home.
    We'll put on those shall praise your excellence
    And set a double var
nish on the fame
    The Frenchman gave you; bring you in fine together
    And wager on your head
s. He, being remiss,
    Most generous, and free from all contriving,
    Will not peruse the foil
s; so that with ease,
    Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
    A sword unbated, and, in 
a pass of practice,
    Requite him for your father.
  Laer. I will do't!
    And for that purpos
e I'll anoint my sword.
    I bought an unction of a mountebank,
    So mortal that, but dip a kni
fe in it,
    Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
    Collected from all simples that have 
virtue
    Under the moon, can save the thing from death
    This is but scratch'd withal. I'll to
uch my point
    With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
    It may be death.
  King. 
Let's further think of this,
    Weigh what convenience both of time and means
    May fit us to o
ur shape. If this should fall,
    And that our drift look through our bad performance.
    'Twere
 better not assay'd. Therefore this project
    Should have a back or second, that might hold
    
If this did blast in proof. Soft! let me see.
    We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings-
    
I ha't!
    When in your motion you are hot and dry-
    As make your bouts more violent to that e
nd-
    And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepar'd him
    A chalice for the nonce; whereon b
ut sipping,
    If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
    Our purpose may hold there.- But st
ay, what noise,

                           Enter Queen.

    How now, sweet queen?
  Queen. On
e woe doth tread upon another's heel,
    So fast they follow. Your sister's drown'd, Laertes.
  L
aer. Drown'd! O, where?
  Queen. There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
    That shows his hoar l
eaves in the glassy stream.
    There with fantastic garlands did she come
    Of crowflowers, net
tles, daisies, and long purples,
    That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
    But our cold 
maids do dead men's fingers call them.
    There on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds
    Clamb
'ring to hang, an envious sliver broke,
    When down her weedy trophies and herself
    Fell in t
he weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide
    And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up;
    Whic
h time she chaunted snatches of old tunes,
    As one incapable of her own distress,
    Or like a
 creature native and indued
    Unto that element; but long it could not be
    Till that her garm
ents, heavy with their drink,
    Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay
    To muddy death
.
  Laer. Alas, then she is drown'd?
  Queen. Drown'd, drown'd.
  Laer. Too much of water hast th
ou, poor Ophelia,
    And therefore I forbid my tears; but yet
    It is our trick; nature her cus
tom holds,
    Let shame say what it will. When these are gone,
    The woman will be out. Adieu, 
my lord.
    I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze
    But that this folly douts it.     
                     Exit.
  King. Let's follow, Gertrude.
    How much I had to do to calm his ra
ge I
    Now fear I this will give it start again;
    Therefore let's follow.
                  
                                       Exeunt.

ACT V. Scene I.
Elsinore. A chu
rchyard.

Enter two Clowns, [with spades and pickaxes].

  Clown. Is she to be buried in Christi
an burial when she
wilfully
    seeks her own salvation?
  Other. I tell thee she is; therefore m
ake her grave straight.
    The crowner hath sate on her, and finds it Christian burial.
  Clown. 
How can that be, unless she drown'd herself in her own
    defence?
  Other. Why, 'tis found so.

  Clown. It must be se offendendo; it cannot be else. For here
lies
    the point: if I drown myse
lf wittingly, it argues an act; and
an
    act hath three branches-it is to act, to do, and to per
form;
    argal, she drown'd herself wittingly.
  Other. Nay, but hear you, Goodman Delver!
  Clo
wn. Give me leave. Here lies the water; good. Here stands
the
    man; good. If the man go to this
 water and drown himself, it
is,
    will he nill he, he goes- mark you that. But if the water
co
me to
    him and drown him, he drowns not himself. Argal, he that is
not
    guilty of his own d
eath shortens not his own life.
  Other. But is this law?
  Clown. Ay, marry, is't- crowner's ques
t law.
  Other. Will you ha' the truth an't? If this had not been a
    gentlewoman, she should ha
ve been buried out o' Christian
burial.
  Clown. Why, there thou say'st! And the more pity that gr
eat
folk
    should have count'nance in this world to drown or hang
themselves
    more than the
ir even-Christian. Come, my spade! There is no
    ancient gentlemen but gard'ners, ditchers, and g
rave-makers.
They
    hold up Adam's profession.
  Other. Was he a gentleman?
  Clown. 'A was th
e first that ever bore arms.
  Other. Why, he had none.
  Clown. What, art a heathen? How dost tho
u understand the
Scripture?
    The Scripture says Adam digg'd. Could he dig without arms?
I'll

    put another question to thee. If thou answerest me not to the
    purpose, confess thyself-
  
Other. Go to!
  Clown. What is he that builds stronger than either the mason,
the
    shipwright,
 or the carpenter?
  Other. The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand
    tenants.
  
Clown. I like thy wit well, in good faith. The gallows does
well.
    But how does it well? It doe
s well to those that do ill. Now,
    thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the

    church. Argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To't again,
come!
  Other. Who builds stronger
 than a mason, a shipwright, or a
    carpenter?
  Clown. Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
  Other. 
Marry, now I can tell!
  Clown. To't.
  Other. Mass, I cannot tell.

                 Enter Haml
et and Horatio afar off.

  Clown. Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull ass
will
  
  not mend his pace with beating; and when you are ask'd this
    question next, say 'a grave-maker
.' The houses he makes lasts
    till doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan; fetch me a stoup of
    l
iquor.
                                            [Exit Second Clown.]


                      
 [Clown digs and] sings.

       In youth when I did love, did love,
         Methought it was ve
ry sweet;
       To contract- O- the time for- a- my behove,
         O, methought there- a- was n
othing- a- meet.

  Ham. Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings
at
    grave-
making?
  Hor. Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.
  Ham. 'Tis e'en so. The hand of
 little employment hath the
daintier
    sense.
  Clown. (sings)
         But age with his steal
ing steps
           Hath clawed me in his clutch,
         And hath shipped me intil the land,
 
          As if I had never been such.
                                            [Throws up a sku
ll.]

  Ham. That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once. How
the
    knave jowls it to t
he ground,as if 'twere Cain's jawbone,
that
    did the first murther! This might be the pate of a

Politician,
    which this ass now o'erreaches; one that would circumvent
God,
    might it not
?
  Hor. It might, my lord.
  Ham. Or of a courtier, which could say 'Good morrow, sweet
lord!
 
   How dost thou, good lord?' This might be my Lord Such-a-one,
that
    prais'd my Lord Such-a-on
e's horse when he meant to beg it-
might
    it not?
  Hor. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Why, e'en so! an
d now my Lady Worm's, chapless, and
knock'd
    about the mazzard with a sexton's spade. Here's fi
ne
revolution,
    and we had the trick to see't. Did these bones cost no more
the
    breeding 
but to play at loggets with 'em? Mine ache to think
    on't.
  Clown. (Sings)
         A pickaxe
 and a spade, a spade,
           For and a shrouding sheet;
         O, a Pit of clay for to be m
ade
           For such a guest is meet.
                                      Throws up [another 
skull].

  Ham. There's another. Why may not that be the skull of a
lawyer?
    Where be his qui
ddits now, his quillets, his cases, his
tenures,
    and his tricks? Why does he suffer this rude 
knave now to
knock
    him about the sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell
him
    of hi
s action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be in's time
a
    great buyer of land, with his statu
tes, his recognizances,
his
    fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries. Is this the fine
of

    his fines, and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his
fine
    pate full of fine dirt? Wi
ll his vouchers vouch him no more
of
    his purchases, and double ones too, than the length and

breadth
    of a pair of indentures? The very conveyances of his lands
will
    scarcely lie in t
his box; and must th' inheritor himself have
no
    more, ha?
  Hor. Not a jot more, my lord.
  
Ham. Is not parchment made of sheepskins?
  Hor. Ay, my lord, And of calveskins too.
  Ham. They a
re sheep and calves which seek out assurance in
that. I
    will speak to this fellow. Whose grave
's this, sirrah?
  Clown. Mine, sir.

    [Sings] O, a pit of clay for to be made
              
For such a guest is meet.

  Ham. I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in't.
  Clown. You l
ie out on't, sir, and therefore 'tis not yours.
    For my part, I do not lie in't, yet it is mine.

  Ham. Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine. 'Tis
for
    the dead, not for the qu
ick; therefore thou liest.
  Clown. 'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away again from me to you.
  Ham
. What man dost thou dig it for?
  Clown. For no man, sir.
  Ham. What woman then?
  Clown. For n
one neither.
  Ham. Who is to be buried in't?
  Clown. One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her so
ul, she's
dead.
  Ham. How absolute the knave is! We must speak by the card, or
    equivocation 
will undo us. By the Lord, Horatio, this three
years
    I have taken note of it, the age is grown
 so picked that the
toe
    of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he
galls
    h
is kibe.- How long hast thou been a grave-maker?
  Clown. Of all the days i' th' year, I came to't 
that day that
our
    last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.
  Ham. How long is that since?
  Clo
wn. Cannot you tell that? Every fool can tell that. It was
the
    very day that young Hamlet was 
born- he that is mad, and sent
    into England.
  Ham. Ay, marry, why was be sent into England?

  Clown. Why, because 'a was mad. 'A shall recover his wits
there;
    or, if 'a do not, 'tis no g
reat matter there.
  Ham. Why?
  Clown. 'Twill not he seen in him there. There the men are as
mad
 as
    he.
  Ham. How came he mad?
  Clown. Very strangely, they say.
  Ham. How strangely?
  
Clown. Faith, e'en with losing his wits.
  Ham. Upon what ground?
  Clown. Why, here in Denmark. I
 have been sexton here, man and
boy
    thirty years.
  Ham. How long will a man lie i' th' earth
 ere he rot?
  Clown. Faith, if 'a be not rotten before 'a die (as we have
many
    pocky corses 
now-a-days that will scarce hold the laying in,
I
    will last you some eight year or nine year. 
A tanner will
last
    you nine year.
  Ham. Why he more than another?
  Clown. Why, sir, his hi
de is so tann'd with his trade that 'a
will
    keep out water a great while; and your water is a 
sore
decayer of
    your whoreson dead body. Here's a skull now. This skull hath
lien
    you i'
 th' earth three-and-twenty years.
  Ham. Whose was it?
  Clown. A whoreson, mad fellow's it was. 
Whose do you think it
was?
  Ham. Nay, I know not.
  Clown. A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! 
'A pour'd a flagon
of
    Rhenish on my head once. This same skull, sir, was Yorick's
    skull, 
the King's jester.
  Ham. This?
  Clown. E'en that.
  Ham. Let me see. [Takes the skull.] Alas, p
oor Yorick! I knew
him,
    Horatio. A fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy.
He
    
hath borne me on his back a thousand times. And now how
abhorred
    in my imagination it is! My g
orge rises at it. Here hung
those
    lips that I have kiss'd I know not how oft. Where be your
g
ibes
    now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment that
    were wont to set the ta
ble on a roar? Not one now, to mock
your
    own grinning? Quite chap- fall'n? Now get you to my l
ady's
    chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this
    favour she must come. Ma
ke her laugh at that. Prithee,
Horatio,
    tell me one thing.
  Hor. What's that, my lord?
  Ha
m. Dost thou think Alexander look'd o' this fashion i' th'
earth?
  Hor. E'en so.
  Ham. And smel
t so? Pah!
                                          [Puts down the skull.]
  Hor. E'en so, my lor
d.
  Ham. To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not
    imagination trace the noble du
st of Alexander till he find it
    stopping a bunghole?
  Hor. 'Twere to consider too curiously, 
to consider so.
  Ham. No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with
modesty
    enough, a
nd likelihood to lead it; as thus: Alexander died,
    Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth in
to dust; the dust
is
    earth; of earth we make loam; and why of that loam (whereto
he
    was 
converted) might they not stop a beer barrel?
    Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
    M
ight stop a hole to keep the wind away.
    O, that that earth which kept the world in awe
    Sho
uld patch a wall t' expel the winter's flaw!
    But soft! but soft! aside! Here comes the King-


    Enter [priests with] a coffin [in funeral procession], King,
             Queen, Laertes, with
 Lords attendant.]

    The Queen, the courtiers. Who is this they follow?
    And with such maim
ed rites? This doth betoken
    The corse they follow did with desp'rate hand
    Fordo it own lif
e. 'Twas of some estate.
    Couch we awhile, and mark.
                                         [
Retires with Horatio.]

  Laer. What ceremony else?
  Ham. That is Laertes,
    A very noble you
th. Mark.
  Laer. What ceremony else?
  Priest. Her obsequies have been as far enlarg'd
    As we
 have warranty. Her death was doubtful;
    And, but that great command o'ersways the order,
    S
he should in ground unsanctified have lodg'd
    Till the last trumpet. For charitable prayers,
  
  Shards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on her.
    Yet here she is allow'd her virgin rites
,
    Her maiden strewments, and the bringing home
    Of bell and burial.
  Laer. Must there no 
more be done?
  Priest. No more be done.
    We should profane the service of the dead
    To sin
g a requiem and such rest to her
    As to peace-parted souls.
  Laer. Lay her i' th' earth;
    
And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
    May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,
    A
 minist'ring angel shall my sister be
    When thou liest howling.
  Ham. What, the fair Ophelia?

  Queen. Sweets to the sweet! Farewell.
                                             [Scatters flo
wers.]
    I hop'd thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
    I thought thy bride-bed to have d
eck'd, sweet maid,
    And not have strew'd thy grave.
  Laer. O, treble woe
    Fall ten times t
reble on that cursed head
    Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
    Depriv'd thee of! Hol
d off the earth awhile,
    Till I have caught her once more in mine arms.
                       
                      Leaps in the grave.
    Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead
    Till 
of this flat a mountain you have made
    T' o'ertop old Pelion or the skyish head
    Of blue Oly
mpus.
  Ham. [comes forward] What is he whose grief
    Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of so
rrow
    Conjures the wand'ring stars, and makes them stand
    Like wonder-wounded hearers? This 
is I,
    Hamlet the Dane.                    [Leaps in after Laertes.
  Laer. The devil take thy 
soul!
                                            [Grapples with him].
  Ham. Thou pray'st not wel
l.
    I prithee take thy fingers from my throat;
    For, though I am not splenitive and rash,
 
   Yet have I in me something dangerous,
    Which let thy wisdom fear. Hold off thy hand!
  King.
 Pluck them asunder.
  Queen. Hamlet, Hamlet!
  All. Gentlemen!
  Hor. Good my lord, be quiet.
 
            [The Attendants part them, and they come out of the
                                   
                      grave.]
  Ham. Why, I will fight with him upon this theme
    Until my eyeli
ds will no longer wag.
  Queen. O my son, what theme?
  Ham. I lov'd Ophelia. Forty thousand broth
ers
    Could not (with all their quantity of love)
    Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?

  King. O, he is mad, Laertes.
  Queen. For love of God, forbear him!
  Ham. 'Swounds, show me w
hat thou't do.
    Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?
    Woo't drink up esi
ll? eat a crocodile?
    I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?
    To outface me with leaping i
n her grave?
    Be buried quick with her, and so will I.
    And if thou prate of mountains, let 
them throw
    Millions of acres on us, till our ground,
    Singeing his pate against the burning
 zone,
    Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
    I'll rant as well as thou.
  Queen. 
This is mere madness;
    And thus a while the fit will work on him.
    Anon, as patient as the f
emale dove
    When that her golden couplets are disclos'd,
    His silence will sit drooping.
  
Ham. Hear you, sir!
    What is the reason that you use me thus?
    I lov'd you ever. But it is n
o matter.
    Let Hercules himself do what he may,
    The cat will mew, and dog will have his day
.
Exit.
  King. I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.
                                       
            Exit Horatio.
    [To Laertes] Strengthen your patience in our last night's
speech.
 
   We'll put the matter to the present push.-
    Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.-
  
  This grave shall have a living monument.
    An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
    Till the
n in patience our proceeding be.
                                                         Exeunt.





Scene II.
Elsinore. A hall in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet and Horatio.

  Ham. So much fo
r this, sir; now shall you see the other.
    You do remember all the circumstance?
  Hor. Remembe
r it, my lord!
  Ham. Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting
    That would not let me slee
p. Methought I lay
    Worse than the mutinies in the bilboes. Rashly-
    And prais'd be rashness
 for it; let us know,
    Our indiscretion sometime serves us well
    When our deep plots do pall
; and that should learn us
    There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
    Rough-hew them how we 
will-
  Hor. That is most certain.
  Ham. Up from my cabin,
    My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in 
the dark
    Grop'd I to find out them; had my desire,
    Finger'd their packet, and in fine with
drew
    To mine own room again; making so bold
    (My fears forgetting manners) to unseal
    T
heir grand commission; where I found, Horatio
    (O royal knavery!), an exact command,
    Larded
 with many several sorts of reasons,
    Importing Denmark's health, and England's too,
    With, 
hoo! such bugs and goblins in my life-
    That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
    No, not t
o stay the finding of the axe,
    My head should be struck off.
  Hor. Is't possible?
  Ham. Her
e's the commission; read it at more leisure.
    But wilt thou bear me how I did proceed?
  Hor. I
 beseech you.
  Ham. Being thus benetted round with villanies,
    Or I could make a prologue to m
y brains,
    They had begun the play. I sat me down;
    Devis'd a new commission; wrote it fair.

    I once did hold it, as our statists do,
    A baseness to write fair, and labour'd much
    
How to forget that learning; but, sir, now
    It did me yeoman's service. Wilt thou know
    Th' 
effect of what I wrote?
  Hor. Ay, good my lord.
  Ham. An earnest conjuration from the King,
   
 As England was his faithful tributary,
    As love between them like the palm might flourish,
   
 As peace should still her wheaten garland wear
    And stand a comma 'tween their amities,
    An
d many such-like as's of great charge,
    That, on the view and knowing of these contents,
    Wi
thout debatement further, more or less,
    He should the bearers put to sudden death,
    Not shr
iving time allow'd.
  Hor. How was this seal'd?
  Ham. Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
   
 I had my father's signet in my purse,
    Which was the model of that Danish seal;
    Folded the
 writ up in the form of th' other,
    Subscrib'd it, gave't th' impression, plac'd it safely,
   
 The changeling never known. Now, the next day
    Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent

    Thou know'st already.
  Hor. So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.
  Ham. Why, man, they d
id make love to this employment!
    They are not near my conscience; their defeat
    Does by the
ir own insinuation grow.
    'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
    Between the pass and f
ell incensed points
    Of mighty opposites.
  Hor. Why, what a king is this!
  Ham. Does it not,
 thinks't thee, stand me now upon-
    He that hath kill'd my king, and whor'd my mother;
    Popp
'd in between th' election and my hopes;
    Thrown out his angle for my proper life,
    And with
 such coz'nage- is't not perfect conscience
    To quit him with this arm? And is't not to be damn'
d
    To let this canker of our nature come
    In further evil?
  Hor. It must be shortly known 
to him from England
    What is the issue of the business there.
  Ham. It will be short; the inte
rim is mine,
    And a man's life is no more than to say 'one.'
    But I am very sorry, good Hora
tio,
    That to Laertes I forgot myself,
    For by the image of my cause I see
    The portrait
ure of his. I'll court his favours.
    But sure the bravery of his grief did put me
    Into a to
w'ring passion.
  Hor. Peace! Who comes here?

                 Enter young Osric, a courtier.


  Osr. Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
  Ham. I humbly thank you, sir. [Aside to H
oratio] Dost know this
    waterfly?
  Hor. [aside to Hamlet] No, my good lord.
  Ham. [aside to 
Horatio] Thy state is the more gracious; for
'tis a
    vice to know him. He hath much land, and f
ertile. Let a beast
be
    lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at the king's mess.
'Tis
   
 a chough; but, as I say, spacious in the possession of dirt.

  Osr. Sweet lord, if your lordship
 were at leisure, I should
impart
    a thing to you from his Majesty.
  Ham. I will receive it, 
sir, with all diligence of spirit. Put
your
    bonnet to his right use. 'Tis for the head.
  Osr
. I thank your lordship, it is very hot.
  Ham. No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is norther
ly.
  Osr. It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
  Ham. But yet methinks it is very sultry and 
hot for my
complexion.
  Osr. Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry, as 'twere- I
cannot
    t
ell how. But, my lord, his Majesty bade me signify to you
that
    he has laid a great wager on yo
ur head. Sir, this is the
matter-
  Ham. I beseech you remember.
                           [Haml
et moves him to put on his hat.]
  Osr. Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here

is
    newly come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute
gentleman,
    full of most excellen
t differences, of very soft society and
    great showing. Indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is
 the
card
    or calendar of gentry; for you shall find in him the
continent of
    what part a 
gentleman would see.
  Ham. Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you; though, I

    know,
 to divide him inventorially would dozy th' arithmetic
of
    memory, and yet but yaw neither in r
espect of his quick sail.
    But, in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of
great
 
   article, and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as, to
make
    true diction of him, his 
semblable is his mirror, and who
else
    would trace him, his umbrage, nothing more.
  Osr. Your
 lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
  Ham. The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman 
in our
more
    rawer breath?
  Osr. Sir?
  Hor [aside to Hamlet] Is't not possible to understan
d in
another
    tongue? You will do't, sir, really.
  Ham. What imports the nomination of this g
entleman?
  Osr. Of Laertes?
  Hor. [aside] His purse is empty already. All's golden words are
  
  spent.
  Ham. Of him, sir.
  Osr. I know you are not ignorant-
  Ham. I would you did, sir; yet
, in faith, if you did, it would
not
    much approve me. Well, sir?
  Osr. You are not ignorant 
of what excellence Laertes is-
  Ham. I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in
 
   excellence; but to know a man well were to know himself.
  Osr. I mean, sir, for his weapon; but
 in the imputation laid on
him
    by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.
  Ham. What's his weapon
?
  Osr. Rapier and dagger.
  Ham. That's two of his weapons- but well.
  Osr. The King, sir, hat
h wager'd with him six Barbary horses;
    against the which he has impon'd, as I take it, six Fren
ch
    rapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers,
and
    so. Three of the car
riages, in faith, are very dear to fancy,
    very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages
, and of
    very liberal conceit.
  Ham. What call you the carriages?
  Hor. [aside to Hamlet] I
 knew you must be edified by the
margent
    ere you had done.
  Osr. The carriages, sir, are the
 hangers.
  Ham. The phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could
    carry cannon by ou
r sides. I would it might be hangers till
then.
    But on! Six Barbary horses against six French 
swords, their
    assigns, and three liberal-conceited carriages: that's the
French
    bet again
st the Danish. Why is this all impon'd, as you call
it?
  Osr. The King, sir, hath laid that, in a
 dozen passes between
    yourself and him, he shall not exceed you three hits; he hath
    laid o
n twelve for nine, and it would come to immediate trial
    if your lordship would vouchsafe the an
swer.
  Ham. How if I answer no?
  Osr. I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.

  Ham. Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please his
Majesty,
    it is the breathing time o
f day with me. Let the foils be
    brought, the gentleman willing, and the King hold his
purpose,

    I will win for him if I can; if not, I will gain nothing but
my
    shame and the odd hits.

  Osr. Shall I redeliver you e'en so?
  Ham. To this effect, sir, after what flourish your nature 
will.
  Osr. I commend my duty to your lordship.
  Ham. Yours, yours. [Exit Osric.] He does well t
o commend it
    himself; there are no tongues else for's turn.
  Hor. This lapwing runs away with
 the shell on his head.
  Ham. He did comply with his dug before he suck'd it. Thus has
he,
    a
nd many more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age
dotes
    on, only got the tune of the ti
me and outward habit of
encounter-
    a kind of yesty collection, which carries them through and

    through the most fann'd and winnowed opinions; and do but
blow
    them to their trial-the bu
bbles are out,

                            Enter a Lord.

  Lord. My lord, his Majesty commende
d him to you by young Osric,
who
    brings back to him, that you attend him in the hall. He sends

to
    know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you
will
    take longer time.

  Ham. I am constant to my purposes; they follow the King's
pleasure.
    If his fitness speaks, 
mine is ready; now or whensoever,
provided
    I be so able as now.
  Lord. The King and Queen an
d all are coming down.
  Ham. In happy time.
  Lord. The Queen desires you to use some gentle ente
rtainment to
    Laertes before you fall to play.
  Ham. She well instructs me.
                 
                                   [Exit Lord.]
  Hor. You will lose this wager, my lord.
  Ham. I
 do not think so. Since he went into France I have been
in
    continual practice. I shall win at 
the odds. But thou wouldst
not
    think how ill all's here about my heart. But it is no matter.

  Hor. Nay, good my lord -
  Ham. It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gaingiving as
    wo
uld perhaps trouble a woman.
  Hor. If your mind dislike anything, obey it. I will forestall
their

    repair hither and say you are not fit.
  Ham. Not a whit, we defy augury; there's a special p
rovidence
in
    the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not to come; if it
be
    not to come
, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will
come:
    the readiness is all. Since no man knows
 aught of what he
leaves,
    what is't to leave betimes? Let be.

    Enter King, Queen, Laerte
s, Osric, and Lords, with other
              Attendants with foils and gauntlets.
               
A table and flagons of wine on it.

  King. Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
     
               [The King puts Laertes' hand into Hamlet's.]
  Ham. Give me your pardon, sir. I have
 done you wrong;
    But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.
    This presence knows,
    And you m
ust needs have heard, how I am punish'd
    With sore distraction. What I have done
    That might
 your nature, honour, and exception
    Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
    Was't Haml
et wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet.
    If Hamlet from himself be taken away,
    And when he's not 
himself does wrong Laertes,
    Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
    Who does it, then? 
His madness. If't be so,
    Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
    His madness is poor Ham
let's enemy.
    Sir, in this audience,
    Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd evil
    Free me s
o far in your most generous thoughts
    That I have shot my arrow o'er the house
    And hurt my 
brother.
  Laer. I am satisfied in nature,
    Whose motive in this case should stir me most
    
To my revenge. But in my terms of honour
    I stand aloof, and will no reconcilement
    Till by 
some elder masters of known honour
    I have a voice and precedent of peace
    To keep my name u
ngor'd. But till that time
    I do receive your offer'd love like love,
    And will not wrong it
.
  Ham. I embrace it freely,
    And will this brother's wager frankly play.
    Give us the foi
ls. Come on.
  Laer. Come, one for me.
  Ham. I'll be your foil, Laertes. In mine ignorance
    Y
our skill shall, like a star i' th' darkest night,
    Stick fiery off indeed.
  Laer. You mock me
, sir.
  Ham. No, by this hand.
  King. Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
    You 
know the wager?
  Ham. Very well, my lord.
    Your Grace has laid the odds o' th' weaker side.
 
 King. I do not fear it, I have seen you both;
    But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds
.
  Laer. This is too heavy; let me see another.
  Ham. This likes me well. These foils have all a
 length?
                                                Prepare to play.
  Osr. Ay, my good lord.

  King. Set me the stoups of wine upon that table.
    If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
 
   Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
    Let all the battlements their ordnance fire;
    T
he King shall drink to Hamlet's better breath,
    And in the cup an union shall he throw
    Rich
er than that which four successive kings
    In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;
    A
nd let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
    The trumpet to the cannoneer without,
    The cannons 
to the heavens, the heaven to earth,
    'Now the King drinks to Hamlet.' Come, begin.
    And you
 the judges, bear a wary eye.
  Ham. Come on, sir.
  Laer. Come, my lord.                         
       They play.
  Ham. One.
  Laer. No.
  Ham. Judgment!
  Osr. A hit, a very palpable hit.
 
 Laer. Well, again!
  King. Stay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
    Here's to thy he
alth.
               [Drum; trumpets sound; a piece goes off [within].
    Give him the cup.
  Ha
m. I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile.
    Come. (They play.) Another hit. What say you?

  Laer. A touch, a touch; I do confess't.
  King. Our son shall win.
  Queen. He's fat, and scant 
of breath.
    Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows.
    The Queen carouses to thy fortune,
 Hamlet.
  Ham. Good madam!
  King. Gertrude, do not drink.
  Queen. I will, my lord; I pray you 
pardon me.          Drinks.
  King. [aside] It is the poison'd cup; it is too late.
  Ham. I dare 
not drink yet, madam; by-and-by.
  Queen. Come, let me wipe thy face.
  Laer. My lord, I'll hit hi
m now.
  King. I do not think't.
  Laer. [aside] And yet it is almost against my conscience.
  Ha
m. Come for the third, Laertes! You but dally.
    Pray you pass with your best violence;
    I am
 afeard you make a wanton of me.
  Laer. Say you so? Come on.                               Play.

  Osr. Nothing neither way.
  Laer. Have at you now!
                [Laertes wounds Hamlet; then]
 in scuffling, they
                    change rapiers, [and Hamlet wounds Laertes].
  King. Part 
them! They are incens'd.
  Ham. Nay come! again!                         The Queen falls.

  Osr.
 Look to the Queen there, ho!
  Hor. They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?
  Osr. How is't
, Laertes?
  Laer. Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric.
    I am justly kill'd with mine
 own treachery.
  Ham. How does the Queen?
  King. She sounds to see them bleed.
  Queen. No, no!
 the drink, the drink! O my dear Hamlet!
    The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.                 [
Dies.]
  Ham. O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd.
    Treachery! Seek it out.
                
                                [Laertes falls.]
  Laer. It is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain
;
    No medicine in the world can do thee good.
    In thee there is not half an hour of life.
 
   The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
    Unbated and envenom'd. The foul practice
    Hat
h turn'd itself on me. Lo, here I lie,
    Never to rise again. Thy mother's poison'd.
    I can n
o more. The King, the King's to blame.
  Ham. The point envenom'd too?
    Then, venom, to thy wor
k.                    Hurts the King.
  All. Treason! treason!
  King. O, yet defend me, friends! 
I am but hurt.
  Ham. Here, thou incestuous, murd'rous, damned Dane,
    Drink off this potion! Is
 thy union here?
    Follow my mother.                                 King dies.
  Laer. He is ju
stly serv'd.
    It is a poison temper'd by himself.
    Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamle
t.
    Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
    Nor thine on me!                        
               Dies.
  Ham. Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.
    I am dead, Horatio. Wr
etched queen, adieu!
    You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
    That are but mutes or 
audience to this act,
    Had I but time (as this fell sergeant, Death,
    Is strict in his arres
t) O, I could tell you-
    But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;
    Thou liv'st; report me and my c
ause aright
    To the unsatisfied.
  Hor. Never believe it.
    I am more an antique Roman than 
a Dane.
    Here's yet some liquor left.
  Ham. As th'art a man,
    Give me the cup. Let go! By 
heaven, I'll ha't.
    O good Horatio, what a wounded name
    (Things standing thus unknown) shal
l live behind me!
    If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,
    Absent thee from felicity awhil
e,
    And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
    To tell my story.         [March afar 
off, and shot within.]
    What warlike noise is this?
  Osr. Young Fortinbras, with conquest come
 from Poland,
    To the ambassadors of England gives
    This warlike volley.
  Ham. O, I die, H
oratio!
    The potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit.
    I cannot live to hear the news from E
ngland,
    But I do prophesy th' election lights
    On Fortinbras. He has my dying voice.
    S
o tell him, with th' occurrents, more and less,
    Which have solicited- the rest is silence.     
        Dies.
  Hor. Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince,
    And flights of angels
 sing thee to thy rest!
                                                 [March within.]
    Why d
oes the drum come hither?

    Enter Fortinbras and English Ambassadors, with Drum,
             
     Colours, and Attendants.

  Fort. Where is this sight?
  Hor. What is it you will see?
    
If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
  Fort. This quarry cries on havoc. O proud Death,
 
   What feast is toward in thine eternal cell
    That thou so many princes at a shot
    So blood
ily hast struck.
  Ambassador. The sight is dismal;
    And our affairs from England come too late
.
    The ears are senseless that should give us hearing
    To tell him his commandment is fulfil
l'd
    That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.
    Where should we have our thanks?
  Hor. N
ot from his mouth,
    Had it th' ability of life to thank you.
    He never gave commandment for 
their death.
    But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
    You from the Polack wars, and y
ou from England,
    Are here arriv'd, give order that these bodies
    High on a stage be placed 
to the view;
    And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
    How these things came about. So s
hall you hear
    Of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts;
    Of accidental judgments, casual slaugh
ters;
    Of deaths put on by cunning and forc'd cause;
    And, in this upshot, purposes mistook

    Fall'n on th' inventors' heads. All this can I
    Truly deliver.
  Fort. Let us haste to hea
r it,
    And call the noblest to the audience.
    For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.
   
 I have some rights of memory in this kingdom
    Which now, to claim my vantage doth invite me.
 
 Hor. Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
    And from his mouth whose voice will draw on mor
e.
    But let this same be presently perform'd,
    Even while men's minds are wild, lest more mi
schance
    On plots and errors happen.
  Fort. Let four captains
    Bear Hamlet like a soldier 
to the stage;
    For he was likely, had he been put on,
    To have prov'd most royally; and for 
his passage
    The soldiers' music and the rites of war
    Speak loudly for him.
    Take up th
e bodies. Such a sight as this
    Becomes the field but here shows much amiss.
    Go, bid the so
ldiers shoot.
            Exeunt marching; after the which a peal of ordnance
                    
                               are shot off.

Hamlet, Prince of Denmark





ACT I. Scene I.
Elsinore. A platform before the Castle.

Enter two Sentinels-[first,] Francisco
, [who paces up and down
at his post; then] Bernardo, [who approaches him].

  Ber. Who's there?

  Fran. Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.
  Ber. Long live the King!
  Fran. Bernardo?

  Ber. He.
  Fran. You come most carefully upon your hour.
  Ber. 'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee
 to bed, Francisco.
  Fran. For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold,
    And I am sick at he
art.
  Ber. Have you had quiet guard?
  Fran. Not a mouse stirring.
  Ber. Well, good night.
   
 If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
    The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.

        
            Enter Horatio and Marcellus.

  Fran. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?
 
 Hor. Friends to this ground.
  Mar. And liegemen to the Dane.
  Fran. Give you good night.
  Mar
. O, farewell, honest soldier.
    Who hath reliev'd you?
  Fran. Bernardo hath my place.
    Giv
e you good night.                                   Exit.
  Mar. Holla, Bernardo!
  Ber. Say-
   
 What, is Horatio there ?
  Hor. A piece of him.
  Ber. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.

  Mar. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
  Ber. I have seen nothing.
  Mar. Horatio 
says 'tis but our fantasy,
    And will not let belief take hold of him
    Touching this dreaded 
sight, twice seen of us.
    Therefore I have entreated him along,
    With us to watch the minute
s of this night,
    That, if again this apparition come,
    He may approve our eyes and speak to
 it.
  Hor. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
  Ber. Sit down awhile,
    And let us once again assa
il your ears,
    That are so fortified against our story,
    What we two nights have seen.
  Ho
r. Well, sit we down,
    And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
  Ber. Last night of all,
    W
hen yond same star that's westward from the pole
    Had made his course t' illume that part of hea
ven
    Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
    The bell then beating one-

              
          Enter Ghost.

  Mar. Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!
  Ber. In the sa
me figure, like the King that's dead.
  Mar. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
  Ber. Look
s it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.
  Hor. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.
  
Ber. It would be spoke to.
  Mar. Question it, Horatio.
  Hor. What art thou that usurp'st this ti
me of night
    Together with that fair and warlike form
    In which the majesty of buried Denmar
k
    Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!
  Mar. It is offended.
  Ber. See, it s
talks away!
  Hor. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!
                                      
               Exit Ghost.
  Mar. 'Tis gone and will not answer.
  Ber. How now, Horatio? You trem
ble and look pale.
    Is not this something more than fantasy?
    What think you on't?
  Hor. B
efore my God, I might not this believe
    Without the sensible and true avouch
    Of mine own ey
es.
  Mar. Is it not like the King?
  Hor. As thou art to thyself.
    Such was the very armour h
e had on
    When he th' ambitious Norway combated.
    So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle
,
    He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
    'Tis strange.
  Mar. Thus twice before, and ju
mp at this dead hour,
    With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
  Hor. In what particular 
thought to work I know not;
    But, in the gross and scope of my opinion,
    This bodes some str
ange eruption to our state.
  Mar. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows,
    Why this sam
e strict and most observant watch
    So nightly toils the subject of the land,
    And why such d
aily cast of brazen cannon
    And foreign mart for implements of war;
    Why such impress of shi
pwrights, whose sore task
    Does not divide the Sunday from the week.
    What might be toward, 
that this sweaty haste
    Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day?
    Who is't that can 
inform me?
  Hor. That can I.
    At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
    Whose image e
ven but now appear'd to us,
    Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
    Thereto prick'd on 
by a most emulate pride,
    Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet
    (For so this sid
e of our known world esteem'd him)
    Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,
    Wel
l ratified by law and heraldry,
    Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
    Which he s
tood seiz'd of, to the conqueror;
    Against the which a moiety competent
    Was gaged by our ki
ng; which had return'd
    To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
    Had he been vanquisher, as, by th
e same cov'nant
    And carriage of the article design'd,
    His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young 
Fortinbras,
    Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
    Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and ther
e,
    Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
    For food and diet, to some enterprise
    That
 hath a stomach in't; which is no other,
    As it doth well appear unto our state,
    But to rec
over of us, by strong hand
    And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
    So by his father l
ost; and this, I take it,
    Is the main motive of our preparations,
    The source of this our w
atch, and the chief head
    Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
  Ber. I think it be no ot
her but e'en so.
    Well may it sort that this portentous figure
    Comes armed through our watc
h, so like the King
    That was and is the question of these wars.
  Hor. A mote it is to trouble
 the mind's eye.
    In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
    A little ere the mightiest Juli
us fell,
    The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead
    Did squeak and gibber in the Ro
man streets;
    As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood,
    Disasters in the sun; and th
e moist star
    Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
    Was sick almost to doomsday with
 eclipse.
    And even the like precurse of fierce events,
    As harbingers preceding still the f
ates
    And prologue to the omen coming on,
    Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
    
Unto our climature and countrymen.

                      Enter Ghost again.

    But soft! beho
ld! Lo, where it comes again!
    I'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!
             
                                  Spreads his arms.
    If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
 
   Speak to me.
    If there be any good thing to be done,
    That may to thee do ease, and, race
 to me,
    Speak to me.
    If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
    Which happily foreknowi
ng may avoid,
    O, speak!
    Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
    Extorted treasure in th
e womb of earth
    (For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death),
                        
                         The cock crows.
    Speak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!
  
Mar. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
  Hor. Do, if it will not stand.
  Ber. 'Tis here!
  
Hor. 'Tis here!
  Mar. 'Tis gone!
                                                     Exit Ghost.

    We do it wrong, being so majestical,
    To offer it the show of violence;
    For it is as 
the air, invulnerable,
    And our vain blows malicious mockery.
  Ber. It was about to speak, whe
n the cock crew.
  Hor. And then it started, like a guilty thing
    Upon a fearful summons. I hav
e heard
    The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
    Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding
 throat
    Awake the god of day; and at his warning,
    Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,

    Th' extravagant and erring spirit hies
    To his confine; and of the truth herein
    This 
present object made probation.
  Mar. It faded on the crowing of the cock.
    Some say that ever,
 'gainst that season comes
    Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
    The bird of dawning 
singeth all night long;
    And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,
    The nights are who
lesome, then no planets strike,
    No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
    So hallow'd
 and so gracious is the time.
  Hor. So have I heard and do in part believe it.
    But look, the 
morn, in russet mantle clad,
    Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.
    Break we our wa
tch up; and by my advice
    Let us impart what we have seen to-night
    Unto young Hamlet; for, 
upon my life,
    This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
    Do you consent we shall acquaint
 him with it,
    As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
    Let's do't, I pray; and I this mo
rning know
    Where we shall find him most conveniently.           Exeunt.




Scene II.
Els
inore. A room of state in the Castle.

Flourish. [Enter Claudius, King of Denmark, Gertrude the Qu
een,
Hamlet,
Polonius, Laertes and his sister Ophelia, [Voltemand, Cornelius,]
Lords Attendant.


  King. Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
    The memory be green, and that it us bef
itted
    To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom
    To be contracted in one brow of w
oe,
    Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
    That we with wisest sorrow think on him

    Together with remembrance of ourselves.
    Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
   
 Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,
    Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,
    Wit
h an auspicious, and a dropping eye,
    With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,
    In
 equal scale weighing delight and dole,
    Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd
    Your bett
er wisdoms, which have freely gone
    With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
    Now follow
s, that you know, young Fortinbras,
    Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
    Or thinking by o
ur late dear brother's death
    Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
    Colleagued with th
is dream of his advantage,
    He hath not fail'd to pester us with message
    Importing the surr
ender of those lands
    Lost by his father, with all bands of law,
    To our most valiant brothe
r. So much for him.
    Now for ourself and for this time of meeting.
    Thus much the business i
s: we have here writ
    To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,
    Who, impotent and bedrid, scarc
ely hears
    Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress
    His further gait herein, in that the l
evies,
    The lists, and full proportions are all made
    Out of his subject; and we here dispat
ch
    You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,
    For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,
 
   Giving to you no further personal power
    To business with the King, more than the scope
    
Of these dilated articles allow.            [Gives a paper.]
    Farewell, and let your haste comme
nd your duty.
  Cor., Volt. In that, and all things, will we show our duty.
  King. We doubt it no
thing. Heartily farewell.
                                 Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius.
    And
 now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
    You told us of some suit. What is't, Laertes?
    You
 cannot speak of reason to the Dane
    And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
    T
hat shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
    The head is not more native to the heart,
    The h
and more instrumental to the mouth,
    Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
    What woul
dst thou have, Laertes?
  Laer. My dread lord,
    Your leave and favour to return to France;
   
 From whence though willingly I came to Denmark
    To show my duty in your coronation,
    Yet no
w I must confess, that duty done,
    My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
    And bow 
them to your gracious leave and pardon.
  King. Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?

  Pol. He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
    By laboursome petition, and at last
    U
pon his will I seal'd my hard consent.
    I do beseech you give him leave to go.
  King. Take thy
 fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,
    And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
    But now, my 
cousin Hamlet, and my son-
  Ham. [aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind!
  King. How 
is it that the clouds still hang on you?
  Ham. Not so, my lord. I am too much i' th' sun.
  Queen
. Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
    And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
 
   Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
    Seek for thy noble father in the dust.
    Thou know's
t 'tis common. All that lives must die,
    Passing through nature to eternity.
  Ham. Ay, madam, 
it is common.
  Queen. If it be,
    Why seems it so particular with thee?
  Ham. Seems, madam, N
ay, it is. I know not 'seems.'
    'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
    Nor customary su
its of solemn black,
    Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,
    No, nor the fruitful river in
 the eye,
    Nor the dejected havior of the visage,
    Together with all forms, moods, shapes of
 grief,
    'That can denote me truly. These indeed seem,
    For they are actions that a man migh
t play;
    But I have that within which passeth show-
    These but the trappings and the suits o
f woe.
  King. 'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
    To give these mourning dutie
s to your father;
    But you must know, your father lost a father;
    That father lost, lost his
, and the survivor bound
    In filial obligation for some term
    To do obsequious sorrow. But t
o persever
    In obstinate condolement is a course
    Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grie
f;
    It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
    A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
    A
n understanding simple and unschool'd;
    For what we know must be, and is as common
    As any t
he most vulgar thing to sense,
    Why should we in our peevish opposition
    Take it to heart? F
ie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
    A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
    To reason most ab
surd, whose common theme
    Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
    From the first cor
se till he that died to-day,
    'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth
    This unprevaili
ng woe, and think of us
    As of a father; for let the world take note
    You are the most immed
iate to our throne,
    And with no less nobility of love
    Than that which dearest father bears
 his son
    Do I impart toward you. For your intent
    In going back to school in Wittenberg,
 
   It is most retrograde to our desire;
    And we beseech you, bend you to remain
    Here in the
 cheer and comfort of our eye,
    Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
  Queen. Let not th
y mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.
    I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.
  Ham. I sh
all in all my best obey you, madam.
  King. Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.
    Be as ourself
 in Denmark. Madam, come.
    This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet
    Sits smiling to my hea
rt; in grace whereof,
    No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day
    But the great cannon to 
the clouds shall tell,
    And the King's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,
    Respeaking earth
ly thunder. Come away.
                                Flourish. Exeunt all but Hamlet.
  Ham. O t
hat this too too solid flesh would melt,
    Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!
    Or that the 
Everlasting had not fix'd
    His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
    How weary, stale, 
flat, and unprofitable
    Seem to me all the uses of this world!
    Fie on't! ah, fie! 'Tis an u
nweeded garden
    That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
    Possess it merely. That
 it should come to this!
    But two months dead! Nay, not so much, not two.
    So excellent a ki
ng, that was to this
    Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
    That he might not beteem 
the winds of heaven
    Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
    Must I remember? Why, sh
e would hang on him
    As if increase of appetite had grown
    By what it fed on; and yet, withi
n a month-
    Let me not think on't! Frailty, thy name is woman!-
    A little month, or ere thos
e shoes were old
    With which she followed my poor father's body
    Like Niobe, all tears- why 
she, even she
    (O God! a beast that wants discourse of reason
    Would have mourn'd longer) ma
rried with my uncle;
    My father's brother, but no more like my father
    Than I to Hercules. W
ithin a month,
    Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
    Had left the flushing in her gal
led eyes,
    She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
    With such dexterity to incestuous she
ets!
    It is not, nor it cannot come to good.
    But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue!


          Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo.

  Hor. Hail to your lordship!
  Ham. I am 
glad to see you well.
    Horatio!- or I do forget myself.
  Hor. The same, my lord, and your poor
 servant ever.
  Ham. Sir, my good friend- I'll change that name with you.
    And what make you f
rom Wittenberg, Horatio?
    Marcellus?
  Mar. My good lord!
  Ham. I am very glad to see you.- [
To Bernardo] Good even, sir.-

    But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
  Hor. A truant 
disposition, good my lord.
  Ham. I would not hear your enemy say so,
    Nor shall you do my ear 
that violence
    To make it truster of your own report
    Against yourself. I know you are no tr
uant.
    But what is your affair in Elsinore?
    We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.

  Hor. My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
  Ham. I prithee do not mock me, fellow studen
t.
    I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
  Hor. Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.

  Ham. Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats
    Did coldly furnish forth the marriage t
ables.
    Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
    Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
   
 My father- methinks I see my father.
  Hor. O, where, my lord?
  Ham. In my mind's eye, Horatio.

  Hor. I saw him once. He was a goodly king.
  Ham. He was a man, take him for all in all.
    I 
shall not look upon his like again.
  Hor. My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
  Ham. Saw? who
?
  Hor. My lord, the King your father.
  Ham. The King my father?
  Hor. Season your admiration 
for a while
    With an attent ear, till I may deliver
    Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
 
   This marvel to you.
  Ham. For God's love let me hear!
  Hor. Two nights together had these gen
tlemen
    (Marcellus and Bernardo) on their watch
    In the dead vast and middle of the night
 
   Been thus encount'red. A figure like your father,
    Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
    App
ears before them and with solemn march
    Goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walk'd
    By 
their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
    Within his truncheon's length; whilst they distill'd

    Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
    Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
    In d
readful secrecy impart they did,
    And I with them the third night kept the watch;
    Where, as
 they had deliver'd, both in time,
    Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
    The ap
parition comes. I knew your father.
    These hands are not more like.
  Ham. But where was this?

  Mar. My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
  Ham. Did you not speak to it?
  Hor. My lor
d, I did;
    But answer made it none. Yet once methought
    It lifted up it head and did address

    Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
    But even then the morning cock crew loud,
    
And at the sound it shrunk in haste away
    And vanish'd from our sight.
  Ham. 'Tis very strange
.
  Hor. As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
    And we did think it writ down in our duty

    To let you know of it.
  Ham. Indeed, indeed, sirs. But this troubles me.
    Hold you the wa
tch to-night?
  Both [Mar. and Ber.] We do, my lord.
  Ham. Arm'd, say you?
  Both. Arm'd, my lor
d.
  Ham. From top to toe?
  Both. My lord, from head to foot.
  Ham. Then saw you not his face?

  Hor. O, yes, my lord! He wore his beaver up.
  Ham. What, look'd he frowningly.
  Hor. A counte
nance more in sorrow than in anger.
  Ham. Pale or red?
  Hor. Nay, very pale.
  Ham. And fix'd h
is eyes upon you?
  Hor. Most constantly.
  Ham. I would I had been there.
  Hor. It would have m
uch amaz'd you.
  Ham. Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
  Hor. While one with moderate haste 
might tell a hundred.
  Both. Longer, longer.
  Hor. Not when I saw't.
  Ham. His beard was grizz
led- no?
  Hor. It was, as I have seen it in his life,
    A sable silver'd.
  Ham. I will watch 
to-night.
    Perchance 'twill walk again.
  Hor. I warr'nt it will.
  Ham. If it assume my noble
 father's person,
    I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
    And bid me hold my peac
e. I pray you all,
    If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
    Let it be tenable in your si
lence still;
    And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
    Give it an understanding but no tongu
e.
    I will requite your loves. So, fare you well.
    Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twel
ve,
    I'll visit you.
  All. Our duty to your honour.
  Ham. Your loves, as mine to you. Farewe
ll.
                                        Exeunt [all but Hamlet].
    My father's spirit- in ar
ms? All is not well.
    I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come!
    Till then sit stil
l, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,
    Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
Exit.





Scene III.
Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius.

Enter Laertes and Ophelia.

  Lae
r. My necessaries are embark'd. Farewell.
    And, sister, as the winds give benefit
    And convo
y is assistant, do not sleep,
    But let me hear from you.
  Oph. Do you doubt that?
  Laer. For
 Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,
    Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood;
    A violet i
n the youth of primy nature,
    Forward, not permanent- sweet, not lasting;
    The perfume and s
uppliance of a minute;
    No more.
  Oph. No more but so?
  Laer. Think it no more.
    For nat
ure crescent does not grow alone
    In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,
    The inward s
ervice of the mind and soul
    Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
    And now no soil n
or cautel doth besmirch
    The virtue of his will; but you must fear,
    His greatness weigh'd, 
his will is not his own;
    For he himself is subject to his birth.
    He may not, as unvalued p
ersons do,
    Carve for himself, for on his choice depends
    The safety and health of this whol
e state,
    And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd
    Unto the voice and yielding of tha
t body
    Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
    It fits your wisdom so far to
 believe it
    As he in his particular act and place
    May give his saying deed; which is no fu
rther
    Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
    Then weigh what loss your honour may sus
tain
    If with too credent ear you list his songs,
    Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasu
re open
    To his unmast'red importunity.
    Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
    And
 keep you in the rear of your affection,
    Out of the shot and danger of desire.
    The charies
t maid is prodigal enough
    If she unmask her beauty to the moon.
    Virtue itself scopes not c
alumnious strokes.
    The canker galls the infants of the spring
    Too oft before their buttons
 be disclos'd,
    And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
    Contagious blastments are most immi
nent.
    Be wary then; best safety lies in fear.
    Youth to itself rebels, though none else nea
r.
  Oph. I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep
    As watchman to my heart. But, good my br
other,
    Do not as some ungracious pastors do,
    Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven,

    Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
    Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads

    And recks not his own rede.
  Laer. O, fear me not!

                       Enter Polonius.


    I stay too long. But here my father comes.
    A double blessing is a double grace;
    Oc
casion smiles upon a second leave.
  Pol. Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame!
    The wi
nd sits in the shoulder of your sail,
    And you are stay'd for. There- my blessing with thee!
  
  And these few precepts in thy memory
    Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
    N
or any unproportion'd thought his act.
    Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar:
    Those fri
ends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
    Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel;
    
But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
    Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware
   
 Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,
    Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee.
    Give 
every man thine ear, but few thy voice;
    Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
   
 Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
    But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
    For t
he apparel oft proclaims the man,
    And they in France of the best rank and station
    Are most
 select and generous, chief in that.
    Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
    For loan oft lose
s both itself and friend,
    And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
    This above all- to th
ine own self be true,
    And it must follow, as the night the day,
    Thou canst not then be fal
se to any man.
    Farewell. My blessing season this in thee!
  Laer. Most humbly do I take my lea
ve, my lord.
  Pol. The time invites you. Go, your servants tend.
  Laer. Farewell, Ophelia, and r
emember well
    What I have said to you.
  Oph. 'Tis in my memory lock'd,
    And you yourself s
hall keep the key of it.
  Laer. Farewell.                                          Exit.
  Pol. W
hat is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?
  Oph. So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.

  Pol. Marry, well bethought!
    'Tis told me he hath very oft of late
    Given private time to 
you, and you yourself
    Have of your audience been most free and bounteous.
    If it be so- as 
so 'tis put on me,
    And that in way of caution- I must tell you
    You do not understand yours
elf so clearly
    As it behooves my daughter and your honour.
    What is between you? Give me up
 the truth.
  Oph. He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
    Of his affection to me.
  Pol.
 Affection? Pooh! You speak like a green girl,
    Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
    Do 
you believe his tenders, as you call them?
  Oph. I do not know, my lord, what I should think,
  P
ol. Marry, I will teach you! Think yourself a baby
    That you have ta'en these tenders for true p
ay,
    Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,
    Or (not to crack the wind of the 
poor phrase,
    Running it thus) you'll tender me a fool.
  Oph. My lord, he hath importun'd me w
ith love
    In honourable fashion.
  Pol. Ay, fashion you may call it. Go to, go to!
  Oph. And 
hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
    With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
  Pol.
 Ay, springes to catch woodcocks! I do know,
    When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
    L
ends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter,
    Giving more light than heat, extinct in both
   
 Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
    You must not take for fire. From this time
    Be s
omething scanter of your maiden presence.
    Set your entreatments at a higher rate
    Than a co
mmand to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
    Believe so much in him, that he is young,
    And with a lar
ger tether may he walk
    Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia,
    Do not believe his vows; fo
r they are brokers,
    Not of that dye which their investments show,
    But mere implorators of 
unholy suits,
    Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
    The better to beguile. This is fo
r all:
    I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth
    Have you so slander any moment le
isure
    As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
    Look to't, I charge you. Come your wa
ys.
  Oph. I shall obey, my lord.
                                                         Exeunt.





Scene IV.
Elsinore. The platform before the Castle.

Enter Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcell
us.

  Ham. The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
  Hor. It is a nipping and an eager air.
  
Ham. What hour now?
  Hor. I think it lacks of twelve.
  Mar. No, it is struck.
  Hor. Indeed? I 
heard it not. It then draws near the season
    Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
        
           A flourish of trumpets, and two pieces go off.
    What does this mean, my lord?
  Ham.
 The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
    Keeps wassail, and the swagg'ring upspring re
els,
    And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
    The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray 
out
    The triumph of his pledge.
  Hor. Is it a custom?
  Ham. Ay, marry, is't;
    But to my 
mind, though I am native here
    And to the manner born, it is a custom
    More honour'd in the 
breach than the observance.
    This heavy-headed revel east and west
    Makes us traduc'd and ta
x'd of other nations;
    They clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase
    Soil our addition; an
d indeed it takes
    From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
    The pith and marrow o
f our attribute.
    So oft it chances in particular men
    That, for some vicious mole of nature
 in them,
    As in their birth,- wherein they are not guilty,
    Since nature cannot choose his 
origin,-
    By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
    Oft breaking down the pales and forts of re
ason,
    Or by some habit that too much o'erleavens
    The form of plausive manners, that these 
men
    Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
    Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,
 
   Their virtues else- be they as pure as grace,
    As infinite as man may undergo-
    Shall in 
the general censure take corruption
    From that particular fault. The dram of e'il
    Doth all 
the noble substance often dout To his own scandal.

                         Enter Ghost.

  Hor
. Look, my lord, it comes!
  Ham. Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
    Be thou a spirit of
 health or goblin damn'd,
    Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
    Be thy int
ents wicked or charitable,
    Thou com'st in such a questionable shape
    That I will speak to t
hee. I'll call thee Hamlet,
    King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me?
    Let me not burst in ig
norance, but tell
    Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,
    Have burst their cerements; w
hy the sepulchre
    Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
    Hath op'd his ponderous and marble j
aws
    To cast thee up again. What may this mean
    That thou, dead corse, again in complete ste
el,
    Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
    Making night hideous, and we fools of nature

    So horridly to shake our disposition
    With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
    Sa
y, why is this? wherefore? What should we do?
                                           Ghost beck
ons Hamlet.
  Hor. It beckons you to go away with it,
    As if it some impartment did desire
   
 To you alone.
  Mar. Look with what courteous action
    It waves you to a more removed ground.

    But do not go with it!
  Hor. No, by no means!
  Ham. It will not speak. Then will I follow it
.
  Hor. Do not, my lord!
  Ham. Why, what should be the fear?
    I do not set my life at a pin'
s fee;
    And for my soul, what can it do to that,
    Being a thing immortal as itself?
    It 
waves me forth again. I'll follow it.
  Hor. What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
    O
r to the dreadful summit of the cliff
    That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
    And there a
ssume some other, horrible form
    Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
    And draw yo
u into madness? Think of it.
    The very place puts toys of desperation,
    Without more motive,
 into every brain
    That looks so many fadoms to the sea
    And hears it roar beneath.
  Ham. 
It waves me still.
    Go on. I'll follow thee.
  Mar. You shall not go, my lord.
  Ham. Hold off
 your hands!
  Hor. Be rul'd. You shall not go.
  Ham. My fate cries out
    And makes each petty
 artire in this body
    As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
                                    
            [Ghost beckons.]

    Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
    By heaven, I'll ma
ke a ghost of him that lets me!-
    I say, away!- Go on. I'll follow thee.
                      
                  Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet.
  Hor. He waxes desperate with imagination.
  Mar. Let'
s follow. 'Tis not fit thus to obey him.
  Hor. Have after. To what issue will this come?
  Mar. S
omething is rotten in the state of Denmark.
  Hor. Heaven will direct it.
  Mar. Nay, let's follow
 him.
                                                         Exeunt.




Scene V.
Elsinore.
 The Castle. Another part of the fortifications.

Enter Ghost and Hamlet.

  Ham. Whither wilt t
hou lead me? Speak! I'll go no further.
  Ghost. Mark me.
  Ham. I will.
  Ghost. My hour is almo
st come,
    When I to sulph'rous and tormenting flames
    Must render up myself.
  Ham. Alas, p
oor ghost!
  Ghost. Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
    To what I shall unfold.
  Ham. 
Speak. I am bound to hear.
  Ghost. So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
  Ham. What?
  
Ghost. I am thy father's spirit,
    Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
    And for the 
day confin'd to fast in fires,
    Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
    Are burnt an
d purg'd away. But that I am forbid
    To tell the secrets of my prison house,
    I could a tale
 unfold whose lightest word
    Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
    Make thy two
 eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
    Thy knotted and combined locks to part,
    And e
ach particular hair to stand on end
    Like quills upon the fretful porcupine.
    But this etern
al blazon must not be
    To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
    If thou didst ever 
thy dear father love-
  Ham. O God!
  Ghost. Revenge his foul and most unnatural murther.
  Ham. 
Murther?
  Ghost. Murther most foul, as in the best it is;
    But this most foul, strange, and un
natural.
  Ham. Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
    As meditation or the thoughts 
of love,
    May sweep to my revenge.
  Ghost. I find thee apt;
    And duller shouldst thou be t
han the fat weed
    That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
    Wouldst thou not stir in this. N
ow, Hamlet, hear.
    'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
    A serpent stung me. So the 
whole ear of Denmark
    Is by a forged process of my death
    Rankly abus'd. But know, thou nobl
e youth,
    The serpent that did sting thy father's life
    Now wears his crown.
  Ham. O my pr
ophetic soul!
    My uncle?
  Ghost. Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
    With witchcr
aft of his wit, with traitorous gifts-
    O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
    So to s
educe!- won to his shameful lust
    The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.
    O Hamlet, wha
t a falling-off was there,
    From me, whose love was of that dignity
    That it went hand in ha
nd even with the vow
    I made to her in marriage, and to decline
    Upon a wretch whose natural
 gifts were poor
    To those of mine!
    But virtue, as it never will be mov'd,
    Though lewd
ness court it in a shape of heaven,
    So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
    Will sate i
tself in a celestial bed
    And prey on garbage.
    But soft! methinks I scent the morning air.

    Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
    My custom always of the afternoon,
    Upon 
my secure hour thy uncle stole,
    With juice of cursed hebona in a vial,
    And in the porches 
of my ears did pour
    The leperous distilment; whose effect
    Holds such an enmity with blood 
of man
    That swift as quicksilver it courses through
    The natural gates and alleys of the bo
dy,
    And with a sudden vigour it doth posset
    And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
   
 The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine;
    And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
    Mos
t lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust
    All my smooth body.
    Thus was I, sleeping, by a
 brother's hand
    Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd;
    Cut off even in the bloss
oms of my sin,
    Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd,
    No reckoning made, but sent to my accou
nt
    With all my imperfections on my head.
  Ham. O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
  Gh
ost. If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.
    Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
    A couch
 for luxury and damned incest.
    But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
    Taint not thy mind, 
nor let thy soul contrive
    Against thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven,
    And to those thor
ns that in her bosom lodge
    To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once.
    The glowworm sh
ows the matin to be near
    And gins to pale his uneffectual fire.
    Adieu, adieu, adieu! Remem
ber me.                      Exit.

  Ham. O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?
    And 
shall I couple hell? Hold, hold, my heart!
    And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
    But b
ear me stiffly up. Remember thee?
    Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
    In this d
istracted globe. Remember thee?
    Yea, from the table of my memory
    I'll wipe away all trivia
l fond records,
    All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past
    That youth and observatio
n copied there,
    And thy commandment all alone shall live
    Within the book and volume of my 
brain,
    Unmix'd with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!
    O most pernicious woman!
    O villain,
 villain, smiling, damned villain!
    My tables! Meet it is I set it down
    That one may smile,
 and smile, and be a villain;
    At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark.        [Writes.]
   
 So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word:
    It is 'Adieu, adieu! Remember me.'
    I have sworn
't.
  Hor. (within) My lord, my lord!

                   Enter Horatio and Marcellus.

  Mar. 
Lord Hamlet!
  Hor. Heaven secure him!
  Ham. So be it!
  Mar. Illo, ho, ho, my lord!
  Ham. Hil
lo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.
  Mar. How is't, my noble lord?
  Hor. What news, my lord?
  M
ar. O, wonderful!
  Hor. Good my lord, tell it.
  Ham. No, you will reveal it.
  Hor. Not I, my l
ord, by heaven!
  Mar. Nor I, my lord.
  Ham. How say you then? Would heart of man once think it?

    But you'll be secret?
  Both. Ay, by heaven, my lord.
  Ham. There's neer a villain dwelling 
in all Denmark
    But he's an arrant knave.
  Hor. There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the g
rave
    To tell us this.
  Ham. Why, right! You are in the right!
    And so, without more circu
mstance at all,
    I hold it fit that we shake hands and part;
    You, as your business and desi
res shall point you,
    For every man hath business and desire,
    Such as it is; and for my own
 poor part,
    Look you, I'll go pray.
  Hor. These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
  
Ham. I am sorry they offend you, heartily;
    Yes, faith, heartily.
  Hor. There's no offence, my
 lord.
  Ham. Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
    And much offence too. Touching thi
s vision here,
    It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.
    For your desire to know what i
s between us,
    O'ermaster't as you may. And now, good friends,
    As you are friends, scholars
, and soldiers,
    Give me one poor request.
  Hor. What is't, my lord? We will.
  Ham. Never ma
ke known what you have seen to-night.
  Both. My lord, we will not.
  Ham. Nay, but swear't.
  Ho
r. In faith,
    My lord, not I.
  Mar. Nor I, my lord- in faith.
  Ham. Upon my sword.
  Mar. W
e have sworn, my lord, already.
  Ham. Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.

                 Ghost cri
es under the stage.

  Ghost. Swear.
  Ham. Aha boy, say'st thou so? Art thou there, truepenny?

    Come on! You hear this fellow in the cellarage.
    Consent to swear.
  Hor. Propose the oath,
 my lord.
  Ham. Never to speak of this that you have seen.
    Swear by my sword.
  Ghost. [bene
ath] Swear.
  Ham. Hic et ubique? Then we'll shift our ground.
    Come hither, gentlemen,
    An
d lay your hands again upon my sword.
    Never to speak of this that you have heard:
    Swear by
 my sword.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear by his sword.
  Ham. Well said, old mole! Canst work i' th' ea
rth so fast?
    A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends."
  Hor. O day and night, but thi
s is wondrous strange!
  Ham. And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
    There are more thin
gs in heaven and earth, Horatio,
    Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
    But come!
    Her
e, as before, never, so help you mercy,
    How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself
    (As I perc
hance hereafter shall think meet
    To put an antic disposition on),
    That you, at such times 
seeing me, never shall,
    With arms encumb'red thus, or this head-shake,
    Or by pronouncing o
f some doubtful phrase,
    As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'
    Or 'If we
 list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'
    Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
    Th
at you know aught of me- this is not to do,
    So grace and mercy at your most need help you,
   
 Swear.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
                                                   [They swear.]

  Ham. Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! So, gentlemen,
    With all my love I do commend me to you;

    And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
    May do t' express his love and friending to you,
    
God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;
    And still your fingers on your lips, I pray
.
    The time is out of joint. O cursed spite
    That ever I was born to set it right!
    Nay,
 come, let's go together.
                                                         Exeunt.

Act II. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius.

Enter Polonius and Reyn
aldo.

  Pol. Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
  Rey. I will, my lord.
  Pol. You 
shall do marvell's wisely, good Reynaldo,
    Before You visit him, to make inquire
    Of his beh
aviour.
  Rey. My lord, I did intend it.
  Pol. Marry, well said, very well said. Look you, sir,

    Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
    And how, and who, what means, and where they k
eep,
    What company, at what expense; and finding
    By this encompassment and drift of questio
n
    That they do know my son, come you more nearer
    Than your particular demands will touch i
t.
    Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
    As thus, 'I know his father and his
 friends,
    And in part him.' Do you mark this, Reynaldo?
  Rey. Ay, very well, my lord.
  Pol.
 'And in part him, but,' you may say, 'not well.
    But if't be he I mean, he's very wild
    Add
icted so and so'; and there put on him
    What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
    As m
ay dishonour him- take heed of that;
    But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips
    As are c
ompanions noted and most known
    To youth and liberty.
  Rey. As gaming, my lord.
  Pol. Ay, or
 drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
    Drabbing. You may go so far.
  Rey. My lord, that w
ould dishonour him.
  Pol. Faith, no, as you may season it in the charge.
    You must not put ano
ther scandal on him,
    That he is open to incontinency.
    That's not my meaning. But breathe h
is faults so quaintly
    That they may seem the taints of liberty,
    The flash and outbreak of 
a fiery mind,
    A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
    Of general assault.
  Rey. But, my good 
lord-
  Pol. Wherefore should you do this?
  Rey. Ay, my lord,
    I would know that.
  Pol. Mar
ry, sir, here's my drift,
    And I believe it is a fetch of warrant.
    You laying these slight 
sullies on my son
    As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' th' working,
    Mark you,
    Your pa
rty in converse, him you would sound,
    Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
    The youth
 you breathe of guilty, be assur'd
    He closes with you in this consequence:
    'Good sir,' or 
so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman'-
    According to the phrase or the addition
    Of man and countr
y-
  Rey. Very good, my lord.
  Pol. And then, sir, does 'a this- 'a does- What was I about to
sa
y?
    By the mass, I was about to say something! Where did I leave?
  Rey. At 'closes in the cons
equence,' at 'friend or so,' and
    gentleman.'
  Pol. At 'closes in the consequence'- Ay, marry!

    He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman.
    I saw him yesterday, or t'other day,
    Or then,
 or then, with such or such; and, as you say,
    There was 'a gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;

    There falling out at tennis'; or perchance,
    'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'
    Vi
delicet, a brothel, or so forth.
    See you now-
    Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of tr
uth;
    And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
    With windlasses and with assays of bias,
    
By indirections find directions out.
    So, by my former lecture and advice,
    Shall you my son
. You have me, have you not?
  Rey. My lord, I have.
  Pol. God b' wi' ye, fare ye well!
  Rey. G
ood my lord!                                    [Going.]
  Pol. Observe his inclination in yourself
.
  Rey. I shall, my lord.
  Pol. And let him ply his music.
  Rey. Well, my lord.
  Pol. Farewe
ll!
                                                  Exit Reynaldo.

                       Ente
r Ophelia.

    How now, Ophelia? What's the matter?
  Oph. O my lord, my lord, I have been so af
frighted!
  Pol. With what, i' th' name of God?
  Oph. My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
   
 Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac'd,
    No hat upon his head, his stockings foul'd,
    U
ngart'red, and down-gyved to his ankle;
    Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,
    
And with a look so piteous in purport
    As if he had been loosed out of hell
    To speak of hor
rors- he comes before me.
  Pol. Mad for thy love?
  Oph. My lord, I do not know,
    But truly I
 do fear it.
  Pol. What said he?
  Oph. He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
    Then goes 
he to the length of all his arm,
    And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
    He falls to 
such perusal of my face
    As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so.
    At last, a little shaking 
of mine arm,
    And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
    He rais'd a sigh so piteous and 
profound
    As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
    And end his being. That done, he lets me g
o,
    And with his head over his shoulder turn'd
    He seem'd to find his way without his eyes,

    For out o' doors he went without their help
    And to the last bended their light on me.
  P
ol. Come, go with me. I will go seek the King.
    This is the very ecstasy of love,
    Whose vio
lent property fordoes itself
    And leads the will to desperate undertakings
    As oft as any pa
ssion under heaven
    That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
    What, have you given him any
 hard words of late?
  Oph. No, my good lord; but, as you did command,
    I did repel his letters
 and denied
    His access to me.
  Pol. That hath made him mad.
    I am sorry that with better 
heed and judgment
    I had not quoted him. I fear'd he did but trifle
    And meant to wrack thee
; but beshrew my jealousy!
    By heaven, it is as proper to our age
    To cast beyond ourselves 
in our opinions
    As it is common for the younger sort
    To lack discretion. Come, go we to th
e King.
    This must be known; which, being kept close, might move
    More grief to hide than ha
te to utter love.
    Come.
                                                         Exeunt.

Sc
ene II.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Flourish. [Enter King and Queen, Rosencrantz and Guilden
stern,
cum aliis.

  King. Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
    Moreover that we much
 did long to see you,
    The need we have to use you did provoke
    Our hasty sending. Something
 have you heard
    Of Hamlet's transformation. So I call it,
    Sith nor th' exterior nor the in
ward man
    Resembles that it was. What it should be,
    More than his father's death, that thus
 hath put him
    So much from th' understanding of himself,
    I cannot dream of. I entreat you 
both
    That, being of so young days brought up with him,
    And since so neighbour'd to his you
th and haviour,
    That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
    Some little time; so by you
r companies
    To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather
    So much as from occasion you may gl
ean,
    Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus
    That, open'd, lies within our remedy.

  Queen. Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,
    And sure I am two men there are not living

    To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
    To show us so much gentry and good will
 
   As to expend your time with us awhile
    For the supply and profit of our hope,
    Your visit
ation shall receive such thanks
    As fits a king's remembrance.
  Ros. Both your Majesties
    
Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
    Put your dread pleasures more into command
    T
han to entreaty.
  Guil. But we both obey,
    And here give up ourselves, in the full bent,
    
To lay our service freely at your feet,
    To be commanded.
  King. Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentl
e Guildenstern.
  Queen. Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz.
    And I beseech you instan
tly to visit
    My too much changed son.- Go, some of you,
    And bring these gentlemen where Ha
mlet is.
  Guil. Heavens make our presence and our practices
    Pleasant and helpful to him!
  Q
ueen. Ay, amen!
                 Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, [with some
                 
                                   Attendants].

                         Enter Polonius.

  Pol
. Th' ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
    Are joyfully return'd.
  King. Thou still hast be
en the father of good news.
  Pol. Have I, my lord? Assure you, my good liege,
    I hold my duty 
as I hold my soul,
    Both to my God and to my gracious king;
    And I do think- or else this br
ain of mine
    Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
    As it hath us'd to do- that I have found

    The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
  King. O, speak of that! That do I long to hear.
  Pol. 
Give first admittance to th' ambassadors.
    My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
  Ki
ng. Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
                                                [E
xit Polonius.]
    He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found
    The head and source of all you
r son's distemper.
  Queen. I doubt it is no other but the main,
    His father's death and our o'
erhasty marriage.
  King. Well, we shall sift him.

              Enter Polonius, Voltemand, and 
Cornelius.

    Welcome, my good friends.
    Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?
  Vo
lt. Most fair return of greetings and desires.
    Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
    His
 nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
    To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack,
    But better
 look'd into, he truly found
    It was against your Highness; whereat griev'd,
    That so his si
ckness, age, and impotence
    Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
    On Fortinbras; whi
ch he, in brief, obeys,
    Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,
    Makes vow before his un
cle never more
    To give th' assay of arms against your Majesty.
    Whereon old Norway, overcom
e with joy,
    Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee
    And his commission to employ tho
se soldiers,
    So levied as before, against the Polack;
    With an entreaty, herein further sho
wn,
                                                [Gives a paper.]
    That it might please you 
to give quiet pass
    Through your dominions for this enterprise,
    On such regards of safety a
nd allowance
    As therein are set down.
  King. It likes us well;
    And at our more consider'
d time we'll read,
    Answer, and think upon this business.
    Meantime we thank you for your we
ll-took labour.
    Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together.
    Most welcome home!        
               Exeunt Ambassadors.
  Pol. This business is well ended.
    My liege, and madam, to
 expostulate
    What majesty should be, what duty is,
    Why day is day, night is night, and tim
e is time.
    Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time.
    Therefore, since brevity is the
 soul of wit,
    And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
    I will be brief. Your nobl
e son is mad.
    Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,
    What is't but to be nothing else
 but mad?
    But let that go.
  Queen. More matter, with less art.
  Pol. Madam, I swear I use n
o art at all.
    That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
    And pity 'tis 'tis true. A f
oolish figure!
    But farewell it, for I will use no art.
    Mad let us grant him then. And now 
remains
    That we find out the cause of this effect-
    Or rather say, the cause of this defect
,
    For this effect defective comes by cause.
    Thus it remains, and the remainder thus.
    
Perpend.
    I have a daughter (have while she is mine),
    Who in her duty and obedience, mark,

    Hath given me this. Now gather, and surmise.
                                             [Rea
ds] the letter.
    'To the celestial, and my soul's idol, the most beautified
      Ophelia,'-


    That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is a vile
      phrase.
    But you shall h
ear. Thus:
                                                        [Reads.]
    'In her excellent 
white bosom, these, &c.'
  Queen. Came this from Hamlet to her?
  Pol. Good madam, stay awhile. I 
will be faithful.     [Reads.]


          'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
            Doubt tha
t the sun doth move;
          Doubt truth to be a liar;
            But never doubt I love.
    
  'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers; I have not art
to
    reckon my groans; but that I l
ove thee best, O most best,
believe
    it. Adieu.
      'Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst 
this machine is to
him,

HAMLET.'

    This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me;
    And 
more above, hath his solicitings,
    As they fell out by time, by means, and place,
    All given
 to mine ear.
  King. But how hath she
    Receiv'd his love?
  Pol. What do you think of me?
  
King. As of a man faithful and honourable.
  Pol. I would fain prove so. But what might you think,

    When I had seen this hot love on the wing
    (As I perceiv'd it, I must tell you that,
    B
efore my daughter told me), what might you,
    Or my dear Majesty your queen here, think,
    If 
I had play'd the desk or table book,
    Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
    Or look'd
 upon this love with idle sight?
    What might you think? No, I went round to work
    And my you
ng mistress thus I did bespeak:
    'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star.
    This must not b
e.' And then I prescripts gave her,
    That she should lock herself from his resort,
    Admit no
 messengers, receive no tokens.
    Which done, she took the fruits of my advice,
    And he, repu
lsed, a short tale to make,
    Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
    Thence to a watch, then
ce into a weakness,
    Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
    Into the madness where
in now he raves,
    And all we mourn for.
  King. Do you think 'tis this?
  Queen. it may be, ve
ry like.
  Pol. Hath there been such a time- I would fain know that-
    That I have Positively sa
id ''Tis so,'
    When it prov'd otherwise.?
  King. Not that I know.
  Pol. [points to his head 
and shoulder] Take this from this, if
this
      be otherwise.
    If circumstances lead me, I wi
ll find
    Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
    Within the centre.
  King. How may 
we try it further?
  Pol. You know sometimes he walks for hours together
    Here in the lobby.
 
 Queen. So he does indeed.
  Pol. At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him.
    Be you and I b
ehind an arras then.
    Mark the encounter. If he love her not,
    And he not from his reason fa
ll'n thereon
    Let me be no assistant for a state,
    But keep a farm and carters.
  King. We 
will try it.

                 Enter Hamlet, reading on a book.

  Queen. But look where sadly t
he poor wretch comes reading.
  Pol. Away, I do beseech you, both away
    I'll board him presentl
y. O, give me leave.
                       Exeunt King and Queen, [with Attendants].
    How does
 my good Lord Hamlet?
  Ham. Well, God-a-mercy.
  Pol. Do you know me, my lord?
  Ham. Excellent 
well. You are a fishmonger.
  Pol. Not I, my lord.
  Ham. Then I would you were so honest a man.

  Pol. Honest, my lord?
  Ham. Ay, sir. To be honest, as this world goes, is to be one
man
    pi
ck'd out of ten thousand.
  Pol. That's very true, my lord.
  Ham. For if the sun breed maggots in
 a dead dog, being a god
    kissing carrion- Have you a daughter?
  Pol. I have, my lord.
  Ham.
 Let her not walk i' th' sun. Conception is a blessing, but
not
    as your daughter may conceive.
 Friend, look to't.
  Pol. [aside] How say you by that? Still harping on my daughter.
Yet
    he 
knew me not at first. He said I was a fishmonger. He is
far
    gone, far gone! And truly in my yo
uth I suff'red much
extremity
    for love- very near this. I'll speak to him again.- What do
you

    read, my lord?
  Ham. Words, words, words.
  Pol. What is the matter, my lord?
  Ham. Betwe
en who?
  Pol. I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
  Ham. Slanders, sir; for the satirical 
rogue says here that old
men
    have grey beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes
    
purging thick amber and plum-tree gum; and that they have a
    plentiful lack of wit, together wit
h most weak hams. All
which,
    sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I
hold i
t
    not honesty to have it thus set down; for you yourself, sir,
    should be old as I am if, l
ike a crab, you could go backward.

  Pol. [aside] Though this be madness, yet there is a method

in't.-
   Will You walk out of the air, my lord?
  Ham. Into my grave?
  Pol. Indeed, that is out
 o' th' air. [Aside] How pregnant
sometimes
    his replies are! a happiness that often madness hi
ts on,
which
    reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of.
I
    will leave h
im and suddenly contrive the means of meeting
between
    him and my daughter.- My honourable lord
, I will most humbly
take
    my leave of you.
  Ham. You cannot, sir, take from me anything that
 I will more
    willingly part withal- except my life, except my life, except
my
    life,

  
                  Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Pol. Fare you well, my lord.
  Ham. Thes
e tedious old fools!
  Pol. You go to seek the Lord Hamlet. There he is.
  Ros. [to Polonius] God 
save you, sir!
                                                Exit [Polonius].

  Guil. My honou
r'd lord!
  Ros. My most dear lord!
  Ham. My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern?

Ah,
    Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
  Ros. As the indifferent children of the earth.

  Guil. Happy in that we are not over-happy.
    On Fortune's cap we are not the very button.
  
Ham. Nor the soles of her shoe?
  Ros. Neither, my lord.
  Ham. Then you live about her waist, or 
in the middle of her
    favours?
  Guil. Faith, her privates we.
  Ham. In the secret parts of F
ortune? O! most true! she is a
    strumpet. What news ?
  Ros. None, my lord, but that the world'
s grown honest.
  Ham. Then is doomsday near! But your news is not true. Let me
    question more 
in particular. What have you, my good friends,
    deserved at the hands of Fortune that she sends 
you to prison
    hither?
  Guil. Prison, my lord?
  Ham. Denmark's a prison.
  Ros. Then is the
 world one.
  Ham. A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and
    dungeons, Denmar
k being one o' th' worst.
  Ros. We think not so, my lord.
  Ham. Why, then 'tis none to you; for 
there is nothing either
good
    or bad but thinking makes it so. To me it is a prison.
  Ros. Wh
y, then your ambition makes it one. 'Tis too narrow for
your
    mind.
  Ham. O God, I could be b
ounded in a nutshell and count myself a
    king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dre
ams.
  Guil. Which dreams indeed are ambition; for the very substance
of
    the ambitious is mer
ely the shadow of a dream.
  Ham. A dream itself is but a shadow.
  Ros. Truly, and I hold ambitio
n of so airy and light a quality
that
    it is but a shadow's shadow.
  Ham. Then are our beggar
s bodies, and our monarchs and
outstretch'd
    heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we to th' court
? for, by
my
    fay, I cannot reason.
  Both. We'll wait upon you.
  Ham. No such matter! I wil
l not sort you with the rest of my
    servants; for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most

    dreadfully attended. But in the beaten way of friendship,
what
    make you at Elsinore?
  
Ros. To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
  Ham. Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; b
ut I thank
you;
    and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny.
Were
    you not
 sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free
    visitation? Come, deal justly with me. Come, 
come! Nay,
speak.
  Guil. What should we say, my lord?
  Ham. Why, anything- but to th' purpose. 
You were sent for; and
    there is a kind of confession in your looks, which your
modesties
    
have not craft enough to colour. I know the good King and
Queen
    have sent for you.
  Ros. To 
what end, my lord?
  Ham. That you must teach me. But let me conjure you by the
rights
    of our
 fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the
    obligation of our ever-preserved love, and 
by what more dear
a
    better proposer could charge you withal, be even and direct
with
    me,
 whether you were sent for or no.
  Ros. [aside to Guildenstern] What say you?
  Ham. [aside] Nay 
then, I have an eye of you.- If you love me,
hold
    not off.
  Guil. My lord, we were sent for.

  Ham. I will tell you why. So shall my anticipation prevent your
    discovery, and your secrecy
 to the King and Queen moult no
    feather. I have of late- but wherefore I know not- lost all
my

    mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes
so
    heavily with my dispositi
on that this goodly frame, the
earth,
    seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent ca
nopy,
the
    air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this
majestical
    roof fretted 
with golden fire- why, it appeareth no other
thing
    to me than a foul and pestilent congregatio
n of vapours. What
a
    piece of work is a man! how noble in reason! how infinite in
    faculti
es! in form and moving how express and admirable! in
    action how like an angel! in apprehension 
how like a god! the
    beauty of the world, the paragon of animals! And yet to me
what
    is th
is quintessence of dust? Man delights not me- no, nor
woman
    neither, though by your smiling yo
u seem to say so.
  Ros. My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.
  Ham. Why did you laugh
 then, when I said 'Man delights not me'?
  Ros. To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what
 lenten
    entertainment the players shall receive from you. We coted
them
    on the way, and h
ither are they coming to offer you service.
  Ham. He that plays the king shall be welcome- his Maj
esty shall
    have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil
and
    target; the 
lover shall not sigh gratis; the humorous man
shall
    end his part in peace; the clown shall mak
e those laugh whose
    lungs are tickle o' th' sere; and the lady shall say her mind
    freely, 
or the blank verse shall halt for't. What players are
    they?
  Ros. Even those you were wont to
 take such delight in, the
    tragedians of the city.
  Ham. How chances it they travel? Their re
sidence, both in
    reputation and profit, was better both ways.
  Ros. I think their inhibition 
comes by the means of the late
    innovation.
  Ham. Do they hold the same estimation they did wh
en I was in
the
    city? Are they so follow'd?
  Ros. No indeed are they not.
  Ham. How comes 
it? Do they grow rusty?
  Ros. Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there
is,
    s
ir, an eyrie of children, little eyases, that cry out on the
top
    of question and are most tyra
nnically clapp'd for't. These
are now
    the fashion, and so berattle the common stages (so they 
call
    them) that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goosequills and
    dare scarce come thithe
r.
  Ham. What, are they children? Who maintains 'em? How are they
    escoted? Will they pursue t
he quality no longer than they can
    sing? Will they not say afterwards, if they should grow
   
 themselves to common players (as it is most like, if their
means
    are no better), their writer
s do them wrong to make them
exclaim
    against their own succession.
  Ros. Faith, there has be
en much to do on both sides; and the
nation
    holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy. Ther
e was, for
a
    while, no money bid for argument unless the poet and the
player
    went to cuf
fs in the question.
  Ham. Is't possible?
  Guil. O, there has been much throwing about of brains.

  Ham. Do the boys carry it away?
  Ros. Ay, that they do, my lord- Hercules and his load too.
 
 Ham. It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark,
and
    those that would make mows 
at him while my father lived give
    twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his picture

in
    little. 'Sblood, there is something in this more than
natural, if
    philosophy could f
ind it out.

                     Flourish for the Players.

  Guil. There are the players.
  H
am. Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come!
Th'
    appurtenance of welcome is f
ashion and ceremony. Let me
comply
    with you in this garb, lest my extent to the players (which
 I
    tell you must show fairly outwards) should more appear like
    entertainment than yours. Y
ou are welcome. But my
uncle-father
    and aunt-mother are deceiv'd.
  Guil. In what, my dear lo
rd?
  Ham. I am but mad north-north-west. When the wind is southerly
I
    know a hawk from a han
dsaw.

                            Enter Polonius.

  Pol. Well be with you, gentlemen!
  Ham. 
Hark you, Guildenstern- and you too- at each ear a hearer!
    That great baby you see there is not
 yet out of his swaddling
    clouts.
  Ros. Happily he's the second time come to them; for they s
ay an
old
    man is twice a child.
  Ham. I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players. Ma
rk
it.-
   You say right, sir; a Monday morning; twas so indeed.
  Pol. My lord, I have news to t
ell you.
  Ham. My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an
actor in
    Rome-
  Pol. 
The actors are come hither, my lord.
  Ham. Buzz, buzz!
  Pol. Upon my honour-
  Ham. Then came e
ach actor on his ass-
  Pol. The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy,
    history
, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral,
    tragical-historical, tragical-comical-histor
ical-pastoral;
scene
    individable, or poem unlimited. Seneca cannot be too heavy,
nor
    Pla
utus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these
are
    the only men.
  Ham. O Jephtha
h, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
  Pol. What treasure had he, my lord?
  Ham. Why,


         'One fair daughter, and no more,
           The which he loved passing well.'

  Pol.
 [aside] Still on my daughter.
  Ham. Am I not i' th' right, old Jephthah?
  Pol. If you call me J
ephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I
    love passing well.
  Ham. Nay, that follows not.
 
 Pol. What follows then, my lord?
  Ham. Why,

           'As by lot, God wot,'

 and then, you
 know,

           'It came to pass, as most like it was.'

    The first row of the pious chans
on will show you more; for
look
    where my abridgment comes.

                     Enter four 
or five Players.

    You are welcome, masters; welcome, all.- I am glad to see
thee
    well.- 
Welcome, good friends.- O, my old friend? Why, thy
face is
    valanc'd since I saw thee last. Com
'st' thou to' beard me in
    Denmark?- What, my young lady and mistress? By'r Lady, your
    lady
ship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last by the
    altitude of a chopine. Pray God your v
oice, like a piece of
    uncurrent gold, be not crack'd within the ring.- Masters, you
are
    a
ll welcome. We'll e'en to't like French falconers, fly at
    anything we see. We'll have a speech 
straight. Come, give us
a
    taste of your quality. Come, a passionate speech.
  1. Play. What s
peech, my good lord?
  Ham. I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never
acted;
    or i
f it was, not above once; for the play, I remember,
pleas'd
    not the million, 'twas caviary to 
the general; but it was (as
I
    receiv'd it, and others, whose judgments in such matters
cried 
in
    the top of mine) an excellent play, well digested in the
scenes,
    set down with as much
 modesty as cunning. I remember one said
    there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter

savoury,
    nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of
    affectation; but cal
l'd it an honest method, as wholesome as
    sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One s
peech
in't
    I chiefly lov'd. 'Twas AEneas' tale to Dido, and thereabout
of it
    especially 
where he speaks of Priam's slaughter. If it live
in
    your memory, begin at this line- let me se
e, let me see:

         'The rugged Pyrrhus, like th' Hyrcanian beast-'

    'Tis not so; it be
gins with Pyrrhus:

         'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
         Black as his purp
ose, did the night resemble
         When he lay couched in the ominous horse,
         Hath now t
his dread and black complexion smear'd
         With heraldry more dismal. Head to foot
         N
ow is be total gules, horridly trick'd
         With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
 
        Bak'd and impasted with the parching streets,
         That lend a tyrannous and a damned l
ight
         To their lord's murther. Roasted in wrath and fire,
         And thus o'ersized with
 coagulate gore,
         With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
         Old grandsire Pr
iam seeks.'

    So, proceed you.
  Pol. Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and goo
d
     discretion.

  1. Play. 'Anon he finds him,
      Striking too short at Greeks. His antiq
ue sword,
      Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
      Repugnant to command. Unequal ma
tch'd,
      Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide;
      But with the whiff and wind of h
is fell sword
      Th' unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
      Seeming to feel this bl
ow, with flaming top
      Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
      Takes prisoner Pyrrh
us' ear. For lo! his sword,
      Which was declining on the milky head
      Of reverend Priam, s
eem'd i' th' air to stick.
      So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
      And, like a neutral
 to his will and matter,
      Did nothing.
      But, as we often see, against some storm,
     
 A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
      The bold winds speechless, and the orb below

      As hush as death- anon the dreadful thunder
      Doth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus' 
pause,
      Aroused vengeance sets him new awork;
      And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall

      On Mars's armour, forg'd for proof eterne,
      With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding swo
rd
      Now falls on Priam.
      Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods,
      In genera
l synod take away her power;
      Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
      And bowl
 the round nave down the hill of heaven,
      As low as to the fiends!

  Pol. This is too long.

  Ham. It shall to the barber's, with your beard.- Prithee say
on.
    He's for a jig or a tale 
of bawdry, or he sleeps. Say on;
come to
    Hecuba.

  1. Play. 'But who, O who, had seen the m
obled queen-'

  Ham. 'The mobled queen'?
  Pol. That's good! 'Mobled queen' is good.

  1. Pla
y. 'Run barefoot up and down, threat'ning the flames
      With bisson rheum; a clout upon that hea
d
      Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
      About her lank and all o'erteemed loins
,
      A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up-
      Who this had seen, with tongue in venom s
teep'd
      'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have pronounc'd.
      But if the gods themselv
es did see her then,
      When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
      In Mincing with his swo
rd her husband's limbs,
      The instant burst of clamour that she made
      (Unless things mort
al move them not at all)
      Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven
      And passion 
in the gods.'

  Pol. Look, whe'r he has not turn'd his colour, and has tears
in's
    eyes. Pri
thee no more!
  Ham. 'Tis well. I'll have thee speak out the rest of this
soon.-
    Good my lord
, will you see the players well bestow'd? Do you
    hear? Let them be well us'd; for they are the 
abstract and
brief
    chronicles of the time. After your death you were better have
a
    bad e
pitaph than their ill report while you live.
  Pol. My lord, I will use them according to their des
ert.
  Ham. God's bodykins, man, much better! Use every man after his
    desert, and who should s
cape whipping? Use them after your
own
    honour and dignity. The less they deserve, the more mer
it is
in
    your bounty. Take them in.
  Pol. Come, sirs.
  Ham. Follow him, friends. We'll hea
r a play to-morrow.
                 Exeunt Polonius and Players [except the First].
    Dost thou
 hear me, old friend? Can you play 'The Murther of
    Gonzago'?
  1. Play. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. W
e'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need, study a
    speech of some dozen or sixteen lines
 which I would set down
and
    insert in't, could you not?
  1. Play. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Very 
well. Follow that lord- and look you mock him not.
                                            [Exi
t First Player.]
    My good friends, I'll leave you till night. You are welcome
to
    Elsinore.

  Ros. Good my lord!
  Ham. Ay, so, God b' wi' ye!
                            [Exeunt Rosencran
tz and Guildenstern
    Now I am alone.
    O what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
    Is it not 
monstrous that this player here,
    But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
    Could force his 
soul so to his own conceit
    That, from her working, all his visage wann'd,
    Tears in his eye
s, distraction in's aspect,
    A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
    With forms to h
is conceit? And all for nothing!
    For Hecuba!
    What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
    T
hat he should weep for her? What would he do,
    Had he the motive and the cue for passion
    Th
at I have? He would drown the stage with tears
    And cleave the general ear with horrid speech;

    Make mad the guilty and appal the free,
    Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed
    The ve
ry faculties of eyes and ears.
    Yet I,
    A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak
    Like John
-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
    And can say nothing! No, not for a king,
    Upon whose pro
perty and most dear life
    A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
    Who calls me villain? br
eaks my pate across?
    Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?
    Tweaks me by th' nose? g
ives me the lie i' th' throat
    As deep as to the lungs? Who does me this, ha?
    'Swounds, I s
hould take it! for it cannot be
    But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall
    To make oppression b
itter, or ere this
    I should have fatted all the region kites
    With this slave's offal. Bloo
dy bawdy villain!
    Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
    O, vengeance!
  
  Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
    That I, the son of a dear father murther'd,
    P
rompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
    Must (like a whore) unpack my heart with words
    A
nd fall a-cursing like a very drab,
    A scullion!
    Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! Hum, I h
ave heard
    That guilty creatures, sitting at a play,
    Have by the very cunning of the scene

    Been struck so to the soul that presently
    They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
    Fo
r murther, though it have no tongue, will speak
    With most miraculous organ, I'll have these Pla
yers
    Play something like the murther of my father
    Before mine uncle. I'll observe his look
s;
    I'll tent him to the quick. If he but blench,
    I know my course. The spirit that I have 
seen
    May be a devil; and the devil hath power
    T' assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps

    Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
    As he is very potent with such spirits,
    Abuses
 me to damn me. I'll have grounds
    More relative than this. The play's the thing
    Wherein I'
ll catch the conscience of the King.         Exit.

ACT III. Scene I.
Elsinore.
 A room in the Castle.

Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern,
and Lord
s.

  King. And can you by no drift of circumstance
    Get from him why he puts on this confusio
n,
    Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
    With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
  Ros. H
e does confess he feels himself distracted,
    But from what cause he will by no means speak.
  G
uil. Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
    But with a crafty madness keeps aloof
    When 
we would bring him on to some confession
    Of his true state.
  Queen. Did he receive you well?

  Ros. Most like a gentleman.
  Guil. But with much forcing of his disposition.
  Ros. Niggard of
 question, but of our demands
    Most free in his reply.
  Queen. Did you assay him
    To any p
astime?
  Ros. Madam, it so fell out that certain players
    We o'erraught on the way. Of these w
e told him,
    And there did seem in him a kind of joy
    To hear of it. They are here about the
 court,
    And, as I think, they have already order
    This night to play before him.
  Pol. 'T
is most true;
    And he beseech'd me to entreat your Majesties
    To hear and see the matter.
 
 King. With all my heart, and it doth much content me
    To hear him so inclin'd.
    Good gentle
men, give him a further edge
    And drive his purpose on to these delights.
  Ros. We shall, my l
ord.
                            Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
  King. Sweet Gertrude, leav
e us too;
    For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
    That he, as 'twere by accident, may 
here
    Affront Ophelia.
    Her father and myself (lawful espials)
    Will so bestow ourselves
 that, seeing unseen,
    We may of their encounter frankly judge
    And gather by him, as he is 
behav'd,
    If't be th' affliction of his love, or no,
    That thus he suffers for.
  Queen. I 
shall obey you;
    And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
    That your good beauties be the happy
 cause
    Of Hamlet's wildness. So shall I hope your virtues
    Will bring him to his wonted way
 again,
    To both your honours.
  Oph. Madam, I wish it may.
                                  
                 [Exit Queen.]
  Pol. Ophelia, walk you here.- Gracious, so please you,
    We wil
l bestow ourselves.- [To Ophelia] Read on this book,
    That show of such an exercise may colour

    Your loneliness.- We are oft to blame in this,
    'Tis too much prov'd, that with devotion's v
isage
    And pious action we do sugar o'er
    The Devil himself.
  King. [aside] O, 'tis too tr
ue!
    How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
    The harlot's cheek, beautied wit
h plast'ring art,
    Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
    Than is my deed to my most p
ainted word.
    O heavy burthen!
  Pol. I hear him coming. Let's withdraw, my lord.
            
                          Exeunt King and Polonius].

                           Enter Hamlet.


  Ham. To be, or not to be- that is the question:
    Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
  
  The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
    Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
    A
nd by opposing end them. To die- to sleep-
    No more; and by a sleep to say we end
    The heart
ache, and the thousand natural shocks
    That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation
    Devoutly 
to be wish'd. To die- to sleep.
    To sleep- perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub!
    For in 
that sleep of death what dreams may come
    When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
    Must 
give us pause. There's the respect
    That makes calamity of so long life.
    For who would bear
 the whips and scorns of time,
    Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
    The pangs
 of despis'd love, the law's delay,
    The insolence of office, and the spurns
    That patient m
erit of th' unworthy takes,
    When he himself might his quietus make
    With a bare bodkin? Who
 would these fardels bear,
    To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
    But that the dread of so
mething after death-
    The undiscover'd country, from whose bourn
    No traveller returns- puzz
les the will,
    And makes us rather bear those ills we have
    Than fly to others that we know 
not of?
    Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
    And thus the native hue of resolution

    Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
    And enterprises of great pith and moment

    With this regard their currents turn awry
    And lose the name of action.- Soft you now!
   
 The fair Ophelia!- Nymph, in thy orisons
    Be all my sins rememb'red.
  Oph. Good my lord,
   
 How does your honour for this many a day?
  Ham. I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
  Oph. My 
lord, I have remembrances of yours
    That I have longed long to re-deliver.
    I pray you, now 
receive them.
  Ham. No, not I!
    I never gave you aught.
  Oph. My honour'd lord, you know rig
ht well you did,
    And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd
    As made the things more r
ich. Their perfume lost,
    Take these again; for to the noble mind
    Rich gifts wax poor when 
givers prove unkind.
    There, my lord.
  Ham. Ha, ha! Are you honest?
  Oph. My lord?
  Ham. A
re you fair?
  Oph. What means your lordship?
  Ham. That if you be honest and fair, your honesty 
should admit
no
    discourse to your beauty.
  Oph. Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce 
than with
honesty?
  Ham. Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform
    honesty fr
om what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty
can
    translate beauty into his likeness. This
 was sometime a
paradox,
    but now the time gives it proof. I did love you once.
  Oph. Indeed,
 my lord, you made me believe so.
  Ham. You should not have believ'd me; for virtue cannot so
   
 inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it. I loved
you
    not.
  Oph. I was the more de
ceived.
  Ham. Get thee to a nunnery! Why wouldst thou be a breeder of
    sinners? I am myself in
different honest, but yet I could
accuse
    me of such things that it were better my mother had n
ot borne
me.
    I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more offences at
my
    beck than 
I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give
    them shape, or time to act them in. What sh
ould such fellows
as I
    do, crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves
all;
    
believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where's your
    father?
  Oph. At home, my lord.
 
 Ham. Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool
    nowhere but in's own house. Far
ewell.
  Oph. O, help him, you sweet heavens!
  Ham. If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plagu
e for thy
dowry:
    be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not
escape
    calumn
y. Get thee to a nunnery. Go, farewell. Or if thou wilt
    needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men
 know well enough what
    monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go; and quickly too.
    Farew
ell.
  Oph. O heavenly powers, restore him!
  Ham. I have heard of your paintings too, well enough
. God hath
    given you one face, and you make yourselves another. You jig,
you
    amble, and y
ou lisp; you nickname God's creatures and make
your
    wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I'll no 
more on't! it hath
made
    me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages. Those that are
    mar
ried already- all but one- shall live; the rest shall keep
as
    they are. To a nunnery, go.     
                       Exit.
  Oph. O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
    The courtier's, s
cholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword,
    Th' expectancy and rose of the fair state,
    The gl
ass of fashion and the mould of form,
    Th' observ'd of all observers- quite, quite down!
    An
d I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
    That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
    Now see 
that noble and most sovereign reason,
    Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
    Tha
t unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
    Blasted with ecstasy. O, woe is me
    T' have see
n what I have seen, see what I see!

                   Enter King and Polonius.

  King. Love? 
his affections do not that way tend;
    Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,
    Wa
s not like madness. There's something in his soul
    O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
   
 And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
    Will be some danger; which for to prevent,
    I ha
ve in quick determination
    Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England
    For the demand 
of our neglected tribute.
    Haply the seas, and countries different,
    With variable objects, 
shall expel
    This something-settled matter in his heart,
    Whereon his brains still beating p
uts him thus
    From fashion of himself. What think you on't?
  Pol. It shall do well. But yet do
 I believe
    The origin and commencement of his grief
    Sprung from neglected love.- How now, 
Ophelia?
    You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said.
    We heard it all.- My lord, do as you 
please;
    But if you hold it fit, after the play
    Let his queen mother all alone entreat him

    To show his grief. Let her be round with him;
    And I'll be plac'd so please you, in the ear

    Of all their conference. If she find him not,
    To England send him; or confine him where

    Your wisdom best shall think.
  King. It shall be so.
    Madness in great ones must not unwat
ch'd go.         Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. hall in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet and three
 of the Players.

  Ham. Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounc'd it to you,
    trippingly 
on the tongue. But if you mouth it, as many of our
    players do, I had as live the town crier spo
ke my lines. Nor
do
    not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all
    gently; fo
r in the very torrent, tempest, and (as I may say)
    whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire 
and beget a
    temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to
the
    soul to hear 
a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion
to
    tatters, to very rags, to split the cars o
f the groundlings,
who
    (for the most part) are capable of nothing but inexplicable
dumb
    
shows and noise. I would have such a fellow whipp'd for
o'erdoing
    Termagant. It out-herods Her
od. Pray you avoid it.
  Player. I warrant your honour.
  Ham. Be not too tame neither; but let yo
ur own discretion be
your
    tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the action;
with
 
   this special observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of
    nature: for anything so overdo
ne is from the purpose of
playing,
    whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, 
as
    'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show Virtue her own
feature,
    scorn her own image, 
and the very age and body of the time
his
    form and pressure. Now this overdone, or come tardy 
off,
though
    it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious
    grieve; the censur
e of the which one must in your allowance
    o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be play
ers that
I
    have seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly (not
to
    speak it pro
fanely), that, neither having the accent of
    Christians, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor m
an, have
so
    strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of Nature's
    journeymen had mad
e men, and not made them well, they
imitated
    humanity so abominably.
  Player. I hope we have
 reform'd that indifferently with us,
sir.
  Ham. O, reform it altogether! And let those that play
 your
clowns
    speak no more than is set down for them. For there be of them
    that will them
selves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren
    spectators to laugh too, though in the mean tim
e some
necessary
    question of the play be then to be considered. That's
villanous
    and sho
ws a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it.
Go
    make you ready.
                     
                            Exeunt Players.

            Enter Polonius, Rosencrantz, and Guildens
tern.

    How now, my lord? Will the King hear this piece of work?
  Pol. And the Queen too, and
 that presently.
  Ham. Bid the players make haste, [Exit Polonius.] Will you two
    help to hast
en them?
  Both. We will, my lord.                       Exeunt they two.
  Ham. What, ho, Horatio
!

                      Enter Horatio.

  Hor. Here, sweet lord, at your service.
  Ham. Horat
io, thou art e'en as just a man
    As e'er my conversation cop'd withal.
  Hor. O, my dear lord!

  Ham. Nay, do not think I flatter;
    For what advancement may I hope from thee,
    That no re
venue hast but thy good spirits
    To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
   
 No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
    And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
    Wh
ere thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
    Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
 
   And could of men distinguish, her election
    Hath seal'd thee for herself. For thou hast been

    As one, in suff'ring all, that suffers nothing;
    A man that Fortune's buffets and rewards

    Hast ta'en with equal thanks; and blest are those
    Whose blood and judgment are so well comm
ingled
    That they are not a pipe for Fortune's finger
    To sound what stop she please. Give m
e that man
    That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
    In my heart's core, ay, in my 
heart of heart,
    As I do thee. Something too much of this I
    There is a play to-night before
 the King.
    One scene of it comes near the circumstance,
    Which I have told thee, of my fath
er's death.
    I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
    Even with the very comment of thy s
oul
    Observe my uncle. If his occulted guilt
    Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
    It 
is a damned ghost that we have seen,
    And my imaginations are as foul
    As Vulcan's stithy. G
ive him heedful note;
    For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,
    And after we will both our j
udgments join
    In censure of his seeming.
  Hor. Well, my lord.
    If he steal aught the whil
st this play is playing,
    And scape detecting, I will pay the theft.

    Sound a flourish. [E
nter Trumpets and Kettledrums. Danish
    march. [Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz
,
      Guildenstern, and other Lords attendant, with the Guard
                       carrying to
rches.

  Ham. They are coming to the play. I must be idle.
    Get you a place.
  King. How far
es our cousin Hamlet?
  Ham. Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish. I eat the
air,
    pro
mise-cramm'd. You cannot feed capons so.
  King. I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet. These wor
ds are
not
    mine.
  Ham. No, nor mine now. [To Polonius] My lord, you play'd once
    i' th' 
university, you say?
  Pol. That did I, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.
  Ham. What did y
ou enact?
  Pol. I did enact Julius Caesar; I was kill'd i' th' Capitol;
Brutus
    kill'd me.
 
 Ham. It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf
there. Be
    the players ready.
  Ros
. Ay, my lord. They stay upon your patience.
  Queen. Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
  Ha
m. No, good mother. Here's metal more attractive.
  Pol. [to the King] O, ho! do you mark that?
  
Ham. Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
                                  [Sits down at Ophelia's feet.
]

  Oph. No, my lord.
  Ham. I mean, my head upon your lap?
  Oph. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Do you 
think I meant country matters?
  Oph. I think nothing, my lord.
  Ham. That's a fair thought to li
e between maids' legs.
  Oph. What is, my lord?
  Ham. Nothing.
  Oph. You are merry, my lord.
 
 Ham. Who, I?
  Oph. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. O God, your only jig-maker! What should a man do but be

merry?
    For look you how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father
died
    within 's two hour
s.
  Oph. Nay 'tis twice two months, my lord.
  Ham. So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, 
for I'll have
a
    suit of sables. O heavens! die two months ago, and not
forgotten
    yet? Th
en there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his
life
    half a year. But, by'r Lady, he must
 build churches then; or
else
    shall he suffer not thinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose


    epitaph is 'For O, for O, the hobby-horse is forgot!'

               Hautboys play. The dumb 
show enters.

    Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing
    him and he her.
 She kneels, and makes show of protestation
    unto him. He takes her up, and declines his head up
on her
    neck. He lays him down upon a bank of flowers. She, seeing
    him asleep, leaves him. 
Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his
    crown, kisses it, pours poison in the sleeper's ears, and

    leaves him. The Queen returns, finds the King dead, and makes
    passionate action. The Pois
oner with some three or four
Mutes,
    comes in again, seem to condole with her. The dead body is

    carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with gifts; she
    seems harsh and unwilling awhi
le, but in the end accepts
    his love.
                                                         
Exeunt.

  Oph. What means this, my lord?
  Ham. Marry, this is miching malhecho; it means mischi
ef.
  Oph. Belike this show imports the argument of the play.

                      Enter Prolog
ue.

  Ham. We shall know by this fellow. The players cannot keep
counsel;
    they'll tell all.

  Oph. Will he tell us what this show meant?
  Ham. Ay, or any show that you'll show him. Be not 
you asham'd
to
    show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means.
  Oph. You are naught, you ar
e naught! I'll mark the play.

    Pro. For us, and for our tragedy,
      Here stooping to your 
clemency,
      We beg your hearing patiently.                     [Exit.]

  Ham. Is this a prol
ogue, or the posy of a ring?
  Oph. 'Tis brief, my lord.
  Ham. As woman's love.

              
Enter [two Players as] King and Queen.

    King. Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round

      Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
      And thirty dozen moons with borrowed she
en
      About the world have times twelve thirties been,
      Since love our hearts, and Hymen d
id our hands,
      Unite comutual in most sacred bands.
    Queen. So many journeys may the sun a
nd moon
      Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
      But woe is me! you are so sick of l
ate,
      So far from cheer and from your former state.
      That I distrust you. Yet, though I 
distrust,
      Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must;
      For women's fear and love holds qu
antity,
      In neither aught, or in extremity.
      Now what my love is, proof hath made you kn
ow;
      And as my love is siz'd, my fear is so.
      Where love is great, the littlest doubts a
re fear;
      Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.
    King. Faith, I must leav
e thee, love, and shortly too;
      My operant powers their functions leave to do.
      And thou
 shalt live in this fair world behind,
      Honour'd, belov'd, and haply one as kind
      For hu
sband shalt thou-
    Queen. O, confound the rest!
      Such love must needs be treason in my bre
ast.
      When second husband let me be accurst!
      None wed the second but who killed the fir
st.

  Ham. [aside] Wormwood, wormwood!

    Queen. The instances that second marriage move
   
   Are base respects of thrift, but none of love.
      A second time I kill my husband dead
     
 When second husband kisses me in bed.
    King. I do believe you think what now you speak;
      
But what we do determine oft we break.
      Purpose is but the slave to memory,
      Of violent 
birth, but poor validity;
      Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree,
      But fall u
nshaken when they mellow be.
      Most necessary 'tis that we forget
      To pay ourselves what 
to ourselves is debt.
      What to ourselves in passion we propose,
      The passion ending, dot
h the purpose lose.
      The violence of either grief or joy
      Their own enactures with thems
elves destroy.
      Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
      Grief joys, joy grieves,
 on slender accident.
      This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
      That even our lo
ves should with our fortunes change;
      For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
      Whether
 love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
      The great man down, you mark his favourite flies,

      The poor advanc'd makes friends of enemies;
      And hitherto doth love on fortune tend,
  
    For who not needs shall never lack a friend,
      And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
 
     Directly seasons him his enemy.
      But, orderly to end where I begun,
      Our wills and 
fates do so contrary run
      That our devices still are overthrown;
      Our thoughts are ours,
 their ends none of our own.
      So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
      But die thy tho
ughts when thy first lord is dead.
    Queen. Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light,
      S
port and repose lock from me day and night,
      To desperation turn my trust and hope,
      An 
anchor's cheer in prison be my scope,
      Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
      Meet w
hat I would have well, and it destroy,
      Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
      I
f, once a widow, ever I be wife!

  Ham. If she should break it now!

    King. 'Tis deeply swor
n. Sweet, leave me here awhile.
      My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile
      The ted
ious day with sleep.
    Queen. Sleep rock thy brain,
                                            
        [He] sleeps.
      And never come mischance between us twain!
Exit.

  Ham. Madam, how l
ike you this play?
  Queen. The lady doth protest too much, methinks.
  Ham. O, but she'll keep he
r word.
  King. Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in't?
  Ham. No, no! They do but 
jest, poison in jest; no offence i'
th'
    world.
  King. What do you call the play?
  Ham. 'Th
e Mousetrap.' Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the
    image of a murther done in Vienna. Gonza
go is the duke's
name;
    his wife, Baptista. You shall see anon. 'Tis a knavish piece
of
    w
ork; but what o' that? Your Majesty, and we that have free
    souls, it touches us not. Let the ga
ll'd jade winch; our
withers
    are unwrung.

                         Enter Lucianus.

    T
his is one Lucianus, nephew to the King.
  Oph. You are as good as a chorus, my lord.
  Ham. I cou
ld interpret between you and your love, if I could
see
    the puppets dallying.
  Oph. You are k
een, my lord, you are keen.
  Ham. It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
  Oph. Still 
better, and worse.
  Ham. So you must take your husbands.- Begin, murtherer. Pox,
leave
    thy d
amnable faces, and begin! Come, the croaking raven doth
    bellow for revenge.

    Luc. Thought
s black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
      Confederate season, else no creature seeing
;
      Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,
      With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, th
rice infected,
      Thy natural magic and dire property
      On wholesome life usurp immediately
.
                                   Pours the poison in his ears.

  Ham. He poisons him i' th' 
garden for's estate. His name's
Gonzago.
    The story is extant, and written in very choice Itali
an. You
    shall see anon how the murtherer gets the love of Gonzago's
wife.
  Oph. The King ris
es.
  Ham. What, frighted with false fire?
  Queen. How fares my lord?
  Pol. Give o'er the play.

  King. Give me some light! Away!
  All. Lights, lights, lights!
                              E
xeunt all but Hamlet and Horatio.
  Ham.   Why, let the strucken deer go weep,
          The hart 
ungalled play;
         For some must watch, while some must sleep:
          Thus runs the world 
away.
    Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers- if the rest of
my
    fortunes turn Turk
 with me-with two Provincial roses on my
raz'd
    shoes, get me a fellowship in a cry of players,
 sir?
  Hor. Half a share.
  Ham.   A whole one I!
         For thou dost know, O Damon dear,
  
         This realm dismantled was
         Of Jove himself; and now reigns here
           A very
, very- pajock.
  Hor. You might have rhym'd.
  Ham. O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word fo
r a thousand
    pound! Didst perceive?
  Hor. Very well, my lord.
  Ham. Upon the talk of the po
isoning?
  Hor. I did very well note him.
  Ham.   Aha! Come, some music! Come, the recorders!
  
       For if the King like not the comedy,
         Why then, belike he likes it not, perdy.
    
Come, some music!

                Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Guil. Good my lord, vo
uchsafe me a word with you.
  Ham. Sir, a whole history.
  Guil. The King, sir-
  Ham. Ay, sir, w
hat of him?
  Guil. Is in his retirement, marvellous distemper'd.
  Ham. With drink, sir?
  Guil.
 No, my lord; rather with choler.
  Ham. Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this

to
    the doctor; for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps
    plunge him into far more
 choler.
  Guil. Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame, and
start
    not so wildly fr
om my affair.
  Ham. I am tame, sir; pronounce.
  Guil. The Queen, your mother, in most great affl
iction of
spirit
    hath sent me to you.
  Ham. You are welcome.
  Guil. Nay, good my lord, thi
s courtesy is not of the right
breed.
    If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, I 
will
do
    your mother's commandment; if not, your pardon and my return
    shall be the end of 
my business.
  Ham. Sir, I cannot.
  Guil. What, my lord?
  Ham. Make you a wholesome answer; my 
wit's diseas'd. But, sir,
such
    answer as I can make, you shall command; or rather, as you
say
,
    my mother. Therefore no more, but to the matter! My mother,
you
    say-
  Ros. Then thus 
she says: your behaviour hath struck her into
    amazement and admiration.
  Ham. O wonderful son
, that can so stonish a mother! But is
there no
    sequel at the heels of this mother's admiratio
n? Impart.
  Ros. She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to
bed.
  Ham. We shall 
obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any
    further trade with us?
  Ros. My lord, you o
nce did love me.
  Ham. And do still, by these pickers and stealers!
  Ros. Good my lord, what is 
your cause of distemper? You do
surely
    bar the door upon your own liberty, if you deny your gr
iefs
to
    your friend.
  Ham. Sir, I lack advancement.
  Ros. How can that be, when you have t
he voice of the King
himself
    for your succession in Denmark?
  Ham. Ay, sir, but 'while the g
rass grows'- the proverb is
something
    musty.

                     Enter the Players with re
corders.

    O, the recorders! Let me see one. To withdraw with you- why
do
    you go about to
 recover the wind of me, as if you would drive
me
    into a toil?
  Guil. O my lord, if my duty 
be too bold, my love is too
unmannerly.
  Ham. I do not well understand that. Will you play upon t
his
pipe?
  Guil. My lord, I cannot.
  Ham. I pray you.
  Guil. Believe me, I cannot.
  Ham. I 
do beseech you.
  Guil. I know, no touch of it, my lord.
  Ham. It is as easy as lying. Govern the
se ventages with your
    fingers and thumbs, give it breath with your mouth, and it
will
    dis
course most eloquent music. Look you, these are the stops.
  Guil. But these cannot I command to an
y utt'rance of harmony. I
    have not the skill.
  Ham. Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing y
ou make of me!
You
    would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you
would
    pluck 
out the heart of my mystery; you would sound me from my
    lowest note to the top of my compass; a
nd there is much
music,
    excellent voice, in this little organ, yet cannot you make it
    spe
ak. 'Sblood, do you think I am easier to be play'd on than
a
    pipe? Call me what instrument you
 will, though you can fret
me,
    you cannot play upon me.

                        Enter Polon
ius.

    God bless you, sir!
  Pol. My lord, the Queen would speak with you, and presently.
  H
am. Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
  Pol. By th' mass, and 'tis like a 
camel indeed.
  Ham. Methinks it is like a weasel.
  Pol. It is back'd like a weasel.
  Ham. Or l
ike a whale.
  Pol. Very like a whale.
  Ham. Then will I come to my mother by-and-by.- They fool 
me to
the
    top of my bent.- I will come by-and-by.
  Pol. I will say so.                      
                Exit.
  Ham. 'By-and-by' is easily said.- Leave me, friends.
                     
                   [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]

    'Tis now the very witching time of night,
    Wh
en churchyards yawn, and hell itself breathes out
    Contagion to this world. Now could I drink ho
t blood
    And do such bitter business as the day
    Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mot
her!
    O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever
    The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom.
 
   Let me be cruel, not unnatural;
    I will speak daggers to her, but use none.
    My tongue an
d soul in this be hypocrites-
    How in my words somever she be shent,
    To give them seals nev
er, my soul, consent!             Exit.




Scene III.
A room in the Castle.

Enter King, Ro
sencrantz, and Guildenstern.

  King. I like him not, nor stands it safe with us
    To let his m
adness range. Therefore prepare you;
    I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
    And he to 
England shall along with you.
    The terms of our estate may not endure
    Hazard so near us as 
doth hourly grow
    Out of his lunacies.
  Guil. We will ourselves provide.
    Most holy and re
ligious fear it is
    To keep those many many bodies safe
    That live and feed upon your Majest
y.
  Ros. The single and peculiar life is bound
    With all the strength and armour of the mind

    To keep itself from noyance; but much more
    That spirit upon whose weal depends and rests
 
   The lives of many. The cesse of majesty
    Dies not alone, but like a gulf doth draw
    What'
s near it with it. It is a massy wheel,
    Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,
    To whose
 huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
    Are mortis'd and adjoin'd; which when it falls,
    Ea
ch small annexment, petty consequence,
    Attends the boist'rous ruin. Never alone
    Did the ki
ng sigh, but with a general groan.
  King. Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;
    For we 
will fetters put upon this fear,
    Which now goes too free-footed.
  Both. We will haste us.
  
                                             Exeunt Gentlemen.

                   Enter Polonius.


  Pol. My lord, he's going to his mother's closet.
    Behind the arras I'll convey myself
   
 To hear the process. I'll warrant she'll tax him home;
    And, as you said, and wisely was it sai
d,
    'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,
    Since nature makes them partial, shoul
d o'erhear
    The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege.
    I'll call upon you ere you go 
to bed
    And tell you what I know.
  King. Thanks, dear my lord.
                              
                  Exit [Polonius].
    O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven;
    It hath the
 primal eldest curse upon't,
    A brother's murther! Pray can I not,
    Though inclination be as
 sharp as will.
    My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent,
    And, like a man to double busi
ness bound,
    I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
    And both neglect. What if this cur
sed hand
    Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,
    Is there not rain enough in the sw
eet heavens
    To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
    But to confront the visage of o
ffence?
    And what's in prayer but this twofold force,
    To be forestalled ere we come to fall
,
    Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;
    My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer

    Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murther'?
    That cannot be; since I am still possess
'd
    Of those effects for which I did the murther-
    My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen
.
    May one be pardon'd and retain th' offence?
    In the corrupted currents of this world
   
 Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,
    And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
    Buy
s out the law; but 'tis not so above.
    There is no shuffling; there the action lies
    In his 
true nature, and we ourselves compell'd,
    Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
    To 
give in evidence. What then? What rests?
    Try what repentance can. What can it not?
    Yet wha
t can it when one cannot repent?
    O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
    O limed soul, t
hat, struggling to be free,
    Art more engag'd! Help, angels! Make assay.
    Bow, stubborn knee
s; and heart with strings of steel,
    Be soft as sinews of the new-born babe!
    All may be wel
l.                                  He kneels.

                         Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. N
ow might I do it pat, now he is praying;
    And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven,
    And 
so am I reveng'd. That would be scann'd.
    A villain kills my father; and for that,
    I, his s
ole son, do this same villain send
    To heaven.
    Why, this is hire and salary, not revenge!

    He took my father grossly, full of bread,
    With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;

    And how his audit stands, who knows save heaven?
    But in our circumstance and course of th
ought,
    'Tis heavy with him; and am I then reveng'd,
    To take him in the purging of his soul
,
    When he is fit and seasoned for his passage?
    No.
    Up, sword, and know thou a more ho
rrid hent.
    When he is drunk asleep; or in his rage;
    Or in th' incestuous pleasure of his b
ed;
    At gaming, swearing, or about some act
    That has no relish of salvation in't-
    Then
 trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,
    And that his soul may be as damn'd and black
   
 As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays.
    This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.          
    Exit.
  King. [rises] My words fly up, my thoughts remain below.
    Words without thoughts ne
ver to heaven go.             Exit.




Scene IV.
The Queen's closet.

Enter Queen and Polon
ius.

  Pol. He will come straight. Look you lay home to him.
    Tell him his pranks have been t
oo broad to bear with,
    And that your Grace hath screen'd and stood between
    Much heat and h
im. I'll silence me even here.
    Pray you be round with him.
  Ham. (within) Mother, mother, mot
her!
  Queen. I'll warrant you; fear me not. Withdraw; I hear him
coming.
                       
       [Polonius hides behind the arras.]

                          Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Now, 
mother, what's the matter?
  Queen. Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
  Ham. Mother, you
 have my father much offended.
  Queen. Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
  Ham. Go, go,
 you question with a wicked tongue.
  Queen. Why, how now, Hamlet?
  Ham. What's the matter now?

  Queen. Have you forgot me?
  Ham. No, by the rood, not so!
    You are the Queen, your husband's
 brother's wife,
    And (would it were not so!) you are my mother.
  Queen. Nay, then I'll set th
ose to you that can speak.
  Ham. Come, come, and sit you down. You shall not budge;
    You go no
t till I set you up a glass
    Where you may see the inmost part of you.
  Queen. What wilt thou 
do? Thou wilt not murther me?
    Help, help, ho!
  Pol. [behind] What, ho! help, help, help!
  H
am. [draws] How now? a rat? Dead for a ducat, dead!
            [Makes a pass through the arras and
] kills Polonius.
  Pol. [behind] O, I am slain!
  Queen. O me, what hast thou done?
  Ham. Nay, 
I know not. Is it the King?
  Queen. O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
  Ham. A bloody deed-
 almost as bad, good mother,
    As kill a king, and marry with his brother.
  Queen. As kill a ki
ng?
  Ham. Ay, lady, it was my word.
                         [Lifts up the arras and sees Poloniu
s.]
    Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
    I took thee for thy better. Take thy fo
rtune.
    Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.
    Leave wringing of your hands. Peace! si
t you down
    And let me wring your heart; for so I shall
    If it be made of penetrable stuff;

    If damned custom have not braz'd it so
    That it is proof and bulwark against sense.
  Quee
n. What have I done that thou dar'st wag thy tongue
    In noise so rude against me?
  Ham. Such a
n act
    That blurs the grace and blush of modesty;
    Calls virtue hypocrite; takes off the ros
e
    From the fair forehead of an innocent love,
    And sets a blister there; makes marriage vow
s
    As false as dicers' oaths. O, such a deed
    As from the body of contraction plucks
    Th
e very soul, and sweet religion makes
    A rhapsody of words! Heaven's face doth glow;
    Yea, t
his solidity and compound mass,
    With tristful visage, as against the doom,
    Is thought-sick
 at the act.
  Queen. Ah me, what act,
    That roars so loud and thunders in the index?
  Ham. L
ook here upon th's picture, and on this,
    The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
    See 
what a grace was seated on this brow;
    Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
    An eye 
like Mars, to threaten and command;
    A station like the herald Mercury
    New lighted on a hea
ven-kissing hill:
    A combination and a form indeed
    Where every god did seem to set his seal

    To give the world assurance of a man.
    This was your husband. Look you now what follows.

    Here is your husband, like a mildew'd ear
    Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
 
   Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
    And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes
 
   You cannot call it love; for at your age
    The heyday in the blood is tame, it's humble,
    
And waits upon the judgment; and what judgment
    Would step from this to this? Sense sure you hav
e,
    Else could you not have motion; but sure that sense
    Is apoplex'd; for madness would not
 err,
    Nor sense to ecstacy was ne'er so thrall'd
    But it reserv'd some quantity of choice

    To serve in such a difference. What devil was't
    That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind
?
    Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
    Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans a
ll,
    Or but a sickly part of one true sense
    Could not so mope.
    O shame! where is thy b
lush? Rebellious hell,
    If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
    To flaming youth let virt
ue be as wax
    And melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame
    When the compulsive ardour gives 
the charge,
    Since frost itself as actively doth burn,
    And reason panders will.
  Queen. O
 Hamlet, speak no more!
    Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul,
    And there I see such bla
ck and grained spots
    As will not leave their tinct.
  Ham. Nay, but to live
    In the rank s
weat of an enseamed bed,
    Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love
    Over the nasty sty
!
  Queen. O, speak to me no more!
    These words like daggers enter in mine ears.
    No more, 
sweet Hamlet!
  Ham. A murtherer and a villain!
    A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe

    Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
    A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
    That f
rom a shelf the precious diadem stole
    And put it in his pocket!
  Queen. No more!

         
       Enter the Ghost in his nightgown.

  Ham. A king of shreds and patches!-
    Save me and h
over o'er me with your wings,
    You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?
  Queen. A
las, he's mad!
  Ham. Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
    That, laps'd in time and passio
n, lets go by
    Th' important acting of your dread command?
    O, say!
  Ghost. Do not forget.
 This visitation
    Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
    But look, amazement on thy mot
her sits.
    O, step between her and her fighting soul
    Conceit in weakest bodies strongest wo
rks.
    Speak to her, Hamlet.
  Ham. How is it with you, lady?
  Queen. Alas, how is't with you,

    That you do bend your eye on vacancy,
    And with th' encorporal air do hold discourse?
   
 Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
    And, as the sleeping soldiers in th' alarm,
    
Your bedded hairs, like life in excrements,
    Start up and stand an end. O gentle son,
    Upon 
the heat and flame of thy distemper
    Sprinkle cool patience! Whereon do you look?
  Ham. On him
, on him! Look you how pale he glares!
    His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
    
Would make them capable.- Do not look upon me,
    Lest with this piteous action you convert
    M
y stern effects. Then what I have to do
    Will want true colour- tears perchance for blood.
  Qu
een. To whom do you speak this?
  Ham. Do you see nothing there?
  Queen. Nothing at all; yet all 
that is I see.
  Ham. Nor did you nothing hear?
  Queen. No, nothing but ourselves.
  Ham. Why, l
ook you there! Look how it steals away!
    My father, in his habit as he liv'd!
    Look where he
 goes even now out at the portal!
                                                     Exit Ghost.

  Queen. This is the very coinage of your brain.
    This bodiless creation ecstasy
    Is very c
unning in.
  Ham. Ecstasy?
    My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time
    And makes as heal
thful music. It is not madness
    That I have utt'red. Bring me to the test,
    And I the matter
 will reword; which madness
    Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
    Lay not that fla
ttering unction to your soul
    That not your trespass but my madness speaks.
    It will but ski
n and film the ulcerous place,
    Whiles rank corruption, mining all within,
    Infects unseen. 
Confess yourself to heaven;
    Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
    And do not spread t
he compost on the weeds
    To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;
    For in the fatness
 of these pursy times
    Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg-
    Yea, curb and woo for leave t
o do him good.
  Queen. O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
  Ham. O, throw away the wors
er part of it,
    And live the purer with the other half,
    Good night- but go not to my uncle'
s bed.
    Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
    That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat

    Of habits evil, is angel yet in this,
    That to the use of actions fair and good
    He like
wise gives a frock or livery,
    That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,
    And that shall lend 
a kind of easiness
    To the next abstinence; the next more easy;
    For use almost can change t
he stamp of nature,
    And either [master] the devil, or throw him out
    With wondrous potency.
 Once more, good night;
    And when you are desirous to be blest,
    I'll blessing beg of you.- 
For this same lord,
    I do repent; but heaven hath pleas'd it so,
    To punish me with this, an
d this with me,
    That I must be their scourge and minister.
    I will bestow him, and will ans
wer well
    The death I gave him. So again, good night.
    I must be cruel, only to be kind;
  
  Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.
    One word more, good lady.
  Queen. What shall I d
o?
  Ham. Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
    Let the bloat King tempt you again to bed;

    Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
    And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,

    Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,
    Make you to ravel all this matter out,

    That I essentially am not in madness,
    But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;
   
 For who that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
    Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib
    Su
ch dear concernings hide? Who would do so?
    No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
    Unpeg the 
basket on the house's top,
    Let the birds fly, and like the famous ape,
    To try conclusions,
 in the basket creep
    And break your own neck down.
  Queen. Be thou assur'd, if words be made 
of breath,
    And breath of life, I have no life to breathe
    What thou hast said to me.
  Ham
. I must to England; you know that?
  Queen. Alack,
    I had forgot! 'Tis so concluded on.
  Ham
. There's letters seal'd; and my two schoolfellows,
    Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,

    They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way
    And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
   
 For 'tis the sport to have the enginer
    Hoist with his own petar; and 't shall go hard
    But
 I will delve one yard below their mines
    And blow them at the moon. O, 'tis most sweet
    Whe
n in one line two crafts directly meet.
    This man shall set me packing.
    I'll lug the guts i
nto the neighbour room.-
    Mother, good night.- Indeed, this counsellor
    Is now most still, m
ost secret, and most grave,
    Who was in life a foolish peating knave.
    Come, sir, to draw to
ward an end with you.
    Good night, mother.
                  [Exit the Queen. Then] Exit Hamlet
, tugging in
                                                       Polonius.

ACT IV. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King and Queen, with Rosencrantz and Guil
denstern.

  King. There's matter in these sighs. These profound heaves
    You must translate; '
tis fit we understand them.
    Where is your son?
  Queen. Bestow this place on us a little while
.
                          [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
    Ah, mine own lord, what hav
e I seen to-night!
  King. What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
  Queen. Mad as the sea and wind when 
both contend
    Which is the mightier. In his lawless fit
    Behind the arras hearing something 
stir,
    Whips out his rapier, cries 'A rat, a rat!'
    And in this brainish apprehension kills

    The unseen good old man.
  King. O heavy deed!
    It had been so with us, had we been there.

    His liberty is full of threats to all-
    To you yourself, to us, to every one.
    Alas, h
ow shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
    It will be laid to us, whose providence
    Should have
 kept short, restrain'd, and out of haunt
    This mad young man. But so much was our love
    We 
would not understand what was most fit,
    But, like the owner of a foul disease,
    To keep it 
from divulging, let it feed
    Even on the pith of life. Where is he gone?
  Queen. To draw apart
 the body he hath kill'd;
    O'er whom his very madness, like some ore
    Among a mineral of met
als base,
    Shows itself pure. He weeps for what is done.
  King. O Gertrude, come away!
    Th
e sun no sooner shall the mountains touch
    But we will ship him hence; and this vile deed
    W
e must with all our majesty and skill
    Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!

       
      Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

    Friends both, go join you with some further aid.
 
   Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
    And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him.
  
  Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body
    Into the chapel. I pray you haste in this.
 
                         Exeunt [Rosencrantz and Guildenstern].
    Come, Gertrude, we'll call up o
ur wisest friends
    And let them know both what we mean to do
    And what's untimely done. [So 
haply slander-]
    Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter,
    As level as the cannon to his bla
nk,
    Transports his poisoned shot- may miss our name
    And hit the woundless air.- O, come aw
ay!
    My soul is full of discord and dismay.
                                                   
      Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A passage in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Safe
ly stow'd.
  Gentlemen. (within) Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!
  Ham. But soft! What noise? Who calls on Ha
mlet? O, here they
come.

               Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Ros. What have 
you done, my lord, with the dead body?
  Ham. Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
  Ros. Te
ll us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
    And bear it to the chapel.
  Ham. Do not believe 
it.
  Ros. Believe what?
  Ham. That I can keep your counsel, and not mine own. Besides,
to be
 
   demanded of a sponge, what replication should be made by the
son
    of a king?
  Ros. Take yo
u me for a sponge, my lord?
  Ham. Ay, sir; that soaks up the King's countenance, his
rewards,
  
  his authorities. But such officers do the King best service
in
    the end. He keeps them, like 
an ape, in the corner of his
jaw;
    first mouth'd, to be last swallowed. When he needs what you

have
    glean'd, it is but squeezing you and, sponge, you shall be
dry
    again.
  Ros. I und
erstand you not, my lord.
  Ham. I am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.
  Ros.
 My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us
to
    the King.
  Ham. The body is w
ith the King, but the King is not with the
body.
    The King is a thing-
  Guil. A thing, my lor
d?
  Ham. Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.
                                  
                       Exeunt.




Scene III.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King.


  King. I have sent to seek him and to find the body.
    How dangerous is it that this man goes 
loose!
    Yet must not we put the strong law on him.
    He's lov'd of the distracted multitude,

    Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;
    And where 'tis so, th' offender's scourge 
is weigh'd,
    But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,
    This sudden sending him aw
ay must seem
    Deliberate pause. Diseases desperate grown
    By desperate appliance are reliev'
d,
    Or not at all.

                    Enter Rosencrantz.

    How now O What hath befall'n
?
  Ros. Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
    We cannot get from him.
  King. But where 
is he?
  Ros. Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
  King. Bring him before us.
  Ro
s. Ho, Guildenstern! Bring in my lord.

        Enter Hamlet and Guildenstern [with Attendants].


  King. Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
  Ham. At supper.
  King. At supper? Where?
  Ham. Not w
here he eats, but where he is eaten. A certain
    convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Yo
ur worm is
your
    only emperor for diet. We fat all creatures else to fat us,
and
    we fat o
urselves for maggots. Your fat king and your lean
beggar
    is but variable service- two dishes, 
but to one table. That's
the
    end.
  King. Alas, alas!
  Ham. A man may fish with the worm th
at hath eat of a king, and
eat
    of the fish that hath fed of that worm.
  King. What dost thou
 mean by this?
  Ham. Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress
through
    the guts o
f a beggar.
  King. Where is Polonius?
  Ham. In heaven. Send thither to see. If your messenger fi
nd him
not
    there, seek him i' th' other place yourself. But indeed, if
you
    find him not 
within this month, you shall nose him as you go
up
    the stair, into the lobby.
  King. Go seek
 him there. [To Attendants.]
  Ham. He will stay till you come.
                                  
          [Exeunt Attendants.]
  King. Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,-
    Which we
 do tender as we dearly grieve
    For that which thou hast done,- must send thee hence
    With f
iery quickness. Therefore prepare thyself.
    The bark is ready and the wind at help,
    Th' ass
ociates tend, and everything is bent
    For England.
  Ham. For England?
  King. Ay, Hamlet.
  
Ham. Good.
  King. So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
  Ham. I see a cherub that sees them. B
ut come, for England!
    Farewell, dear mother.
  King. Thy loving father, Hamlet.
  Ham. My mot
her! Father and mother is man and wife; man and wife
is
    one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, fo
r England!
Exit.
  King. Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard.
    Delay it not; I'll 
have him hence to-night.
    Away! for everything is seal'd and done
    That else leans on th' af
fair. Pray you make haste.
                            Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]
    An
d, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught,-
    As my great power thereof may give thee sense,

    Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
    After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
    Pay
s homage to us,- thou mayst not coldly set
    Our sovereign process, which imports at full,
    B
y letters congruing to that effect,
    The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;
    For like 
the hectic in my blood he rages,
    And thou must cure me. Till I know 'tis done,
    Howe'er my 
haps, my joys were ne'er begun.             Exit.

Scene IV.
Near Elsinore.


Enter Fortinbras with his Army over the stage.

  For. Go, Captain, from me greet the Danish king.

    Tell him that by his license Fortinbras
    Craves the conveyance of a promis'd march
    Ov
er his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.
    If that his Majesty would aught with us,
    We shall
 express our duty in his eye;
    And let him know so.
  Capt. I will do't, my lord.
  For. Go so
ftly on.
                                   Exeunt [all but the Captain].

       Enter Hamlet, R
osencrantz, [Guildenstern,] and others.

  Ham. Good sir, whose powers are these?
  Capt. They ar
e of Norway, sir.
  Ham. How purpos'd, sir, I pray you?
  Capt. Against some part of Poland.
  Ha
m. Who commands them, sir?
  Capt. The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.
  Ham. Goes it against th
e main of Poland, sir,
    Or for some frontier?
  Capt. Truly to speak, and with no addition,
  
  We go to gain a little patch of ground
    That hath in it no profit but the name.
    To pay fi
ve ducats, five, I would not farm it;
    Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
    A ranker rat
e, should it be sold in fee.
  Ham. Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
  Capt. Yes, it is 
already garrison'd.
  Ham. Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
    Will not debate the q
uestion of this straw.
    This is th' imposthume of much wealth and peace,
    That inward breaks
, and shows no cause without
    Why the man dies.- I humbly thank you, sir.
  Capt. God b' wi' yo
u, sir.                             [Exit.]
  Ros. Will't please you go, my lord?
  Ham. I'll be w
ith you straight. Go a little before.
                                        [Exeunt all but Hamle
t.]
    How all occasions do inform against me
    And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
    I
f his chief good and market of his time
    Be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.
    Sure h
e that made us with such large discourse,
    Looking before and after, gave us not
    That capab
ility and godlike reason
    To fust in us unus'd. Now, whether it be
    Bestial oblivion, or som
e craven scruple
    Of thinking too precisely on th' event,-
    A thought which, quarter'd, hath
 but one part wisdom
    And ever three parts coward,- I do not know
    Why yet I live to say 'Th
is thing's to do,'
    Sith I have cause, and will, and strength, and means
    To do't. Examples 
gross as earth exhort me.
    Witness this army of such mass and charge,
    Led by a delicate and
 tender prince,
    Whose spirit, with divine ambition puff'd,
    Makes mouths at the invisible e
vent,
    Exposing what is mortal and unsure
    To all that fortune, death, and danger dare,
   
 Even for an eggshell. Rightly to be great
    Is not to stir without great argument,
    But grea
tly to find quarrel in a straw
    When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,
    That have a f
ather kill'd, a mother stain'd,
    Excitements of my reason and my blood,
    And let all sleep, 
while to my shame I see
    The imminent death of twenty thousand men
    That for a fantasy and t
rick of fame
    Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot
    Whereon the numbers cannot try
 the cause,
    Which is not tomb enough and continent
    To hide the slain? O, from this time fo
rth,
    My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!            Exit.

Scene V.

Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter Horatio, Queen, and a Gentleman.

  Queen. I will not s
peak with her.
  Gent. She is importunate, indeed distract.
    Her mood will needs be pitied.
  
Queen. What would she have?
  Gent. She speaks much of her father; says she hears
    There's tric
ks i' th' world, and hems, and beats her heart;
    Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in do
ubt,
    That carry but half sense. Her speech is nothing,
    Yet the unshaped use of it doth mov
e
    The hearers to collection; they aim at it,
    And botch the words up fit to their own thoug
hts;
    Which, as her winks and nods and gestures yield them,
    Indeed would make one think the
re might be thought,
    Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
  Hor. 'Twere good she were spok
en with; for she may strew
    Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.
  Queen. Let her come 
in.
                                               [Exit Gentleman.]
    [Aside] To my sick soul (
as sin's true nature is)
    Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
    So full of artless j
ealousy is guilt
    It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.

                 Enter Ophelia dis
tracted.

  Oph. Where is the beauteous Majesty of Denmark?
  Queen. How now, Ophelia?
  Oph. (s
ings)
         How should I your true-love know
           From another one?
         By his cock
le bat and' staff
           And his sandal shoon.

  Queen. Alas, sweet lady, what imports this 
song?
  Oph. Say you? Nay, pray You mark.

    (Sings) He is dead and gone, lady,
              
He is dead and gone;
            At his head a grass-green turf,
              At his heels a ston
e.

    O, ho!
  Queen. Nay, but Ophelia-
  Oph. Pray you mark.

    (Sings) White his shroud 
as the mountain snow-

                    Enter King.

  Queen. Alas, look here, my lord!
  Op
h. (Sings)
           Larded all with sweet flowers;
         Which bewept to the grave did not go

           With true-love showers.

  King. How do you, pretty lady?
  Oph. Well, God dild you!
 They say the owl was a baker's
daughter.
    Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we may 
be. God
be at
    your table!
  King. Conceit upon her father.
  Oph. Pray let's have no words o
f this; but when they ask, you
what
    it means, say you this:

    (Sings) To-morrow is Saint 
Valentine's day,
              All in the morning bedtime,
            And I a maid at your window
,
              To be your Valentine.

            Then up he rose and donn'd his clo'es
       
       And dupp'd the chamber door,
            Let in the maid, that out a maid
              Nev
er departed more.

  King. Pretty Ophelia!
  Oph. Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end o
n't!

    [Sings] By Gis and by Saint Charity,
              Alack, and fie for shame!
         
   Young men will do't if they come to't
              By Cock, they are to blame.

            Q
uoth she, 'Before you tumbled me,
              You promis'd me to wed.'

    He answers:

    
        'So would I 'a' done, by yonder sun,
              An thou hadst not come to my bed.'

  
King. How long hath she been thus?
  Oph. I hope all will be well. We must be patient; but I cannot

    choose but weep to think they would lay him i' th' cold
ground.
    My brother shall know of
 it; and so I thank you for your good
    counsel. Come, my coach! Good night, ladies. Good night,

sweet
    ladies. Good night, good night.                         Exit
  King. Follow her close; 
give her good watch, I pray you.
                                                 [Exit Horatio.]


    O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs
    All from her father's death. O Gertrude, 
Gertrude,
    When sorrows come, they come not single spies.
    But in battalions! First, her fat
her slain;
    Next, your son gone, and he most violent author
    Of his own just remove; the peo
ple muddied,
    Thick and and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers
    For good Polonius' d
eath, and we have done but greenly
    In hugger-mugger to inter him; poor Ophelia
    Divided fro
m herself and her fair judgment,
    Without the which we are pictures or mere beasts;
    Last, a
nd as much containing as all these,
    Her brother is in secret come from France;
    And wants n
ot buzzers to infect his ear
    Feeds on his wonder, keep, himself in clouds,
    With pestilent 
speeches of his father's death,
    Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
    Will nothing stick 
our person to arraign
    In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
    Like to a murd'ring piece,
 in many places
    Give me superfluous death.                  A noise within.
  Queen. Alack, wh
at noise is this?
  King. Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.

                     E
nter a Messenger.

    What is the matter?
  Mess. Save Yourself, my lord:
    The ocean, overpe
ering of his list,
    Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
    Than Young Laertes, in a r
iotous head,
    O'erbears Your offices. The rabble call him lord;
    And, as the world were now 
but to begin,
    Antiquity forgot, custom not known,
    The ratifiers and props of every word,

    They cry 'Choose we! Laertes shall be king!'
    Caps, hands, and tongues applaud it to the clo
uds,
    'Laertes shall be king! Laertes king!'
                                                 A
 noise within.
  Queen. How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!
    O, this is counter, you fa
lse Danish dogs!
  King. The doors are broke.

                    Enter Laertes with others.


  Laer. Where is this king?- Sirs, staid you all without.
  All. No, let's come in!
  Laer. I pray
 you give me leave.
  All. We will, we will!
  Laer. I thank you. Keep the door.      [Exeunt his 
Followers.]
    O thou vile king,
    Give me my father!
  Queen. Calmly, good Laertes.
  Laer. 
That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard;
    Cries cuckold to my father; brands the har
lot
    Even here between the chaste unsmirched brows
    Of my true mother.
  King. What is the 
cause, Laertes,
    That thy rebellion looks so giantlike?
    Let him go, Gertrude. Do not fear o
ur person.
    There's such divinity doth hedge a king
    That treason can but peep to what it wo
uld,
    Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,
    Why thou art thus incens'd. Let him go, Ge
rtrude.
    Speak, man.
  Laer. Where is my father?
  King. Dead.
  Queen. But not by him!
  Ki
ng. Let him demand his fill.
  Laer. How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
    To hell, alle
giance! vows, to the blackest devil
    Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
    I dare d
amnation. To this point I stand,
    That both the world, I give to negligence,
    Let come what 
comes; only I'll be reveng'd
    Most throughly for my father.
  King. Who shall stay you?
  Laer
. My will, not all the world!
    And for my means, I'll husband them so well
    They shall go fa
r with little.
  King. Good Laertes,
    If you desire to know the certainty
    Of your dear fat
her's death, is't writ in your revenge
    That sweepstake you will draw both friend and foe,
    
Winner and loser?
  Laer. None but his enemies.
  King. Will you know them then?
  Laer. To his g
ood friends thus wide I'll ope my arms
    And, like the kind life-rend'ring pelican,
    Repast t
hem with my blood.
  King. Why, now You speak
    Like a good child and a true gentleman.
    Tha
t I am guiltless of your father's death,
    And am most sensibly in grief for it,
    It shall as
 level to your judgment pierce
    As day does to your eye.
                              A noise 
within: 'Let her come in.'
  Laer. How now? What noise is that?

                      Enter Ophe
lia.

    O heat, dry up my brains! Tears seven times salt
    Burn out the sense and virtue of m
ine eye!
    By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight
    Till our scale turn the beam. O ro
se of May!
    Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
    O heavens! is't possible a young maid's 
wits
    Should be as mortal as an old man's life?
    Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine
,
    It sends some precious instance of itself
    After the thing it loves.

  Oph. (sings)
 
        They bore him barefac'd on the bier
           (Hey non nony, nony, hey nony)
         And
 in his grave rain'd many a tear.

    Fare you well, my dove!
  Laer. Hadst thou thy wits, and d
idst persuade revenge,
    It could not move thus.
  Oph. You must sing 'A-down a-down, and you ca
ll him a-down-a.'
O,
    how the wheel becomes it! It is the false steward, that stole
his
    m
aster's daughter.
  Laer. This nothing's more than matter.
  Oph. There's rosemary, that's for rem
embrance. Pray you, love,
    remember. And there is pansies, that's for thoughts.
  Laer. A docum
ent in madness! Thoughts and remembrance fitted.
  Oph. There's fennel for you, and columbines. The
re's rue for
you,
    and here's some for me. We may call it herb of grace o'
Sundays.
    O, yo
u must wear your rue with a difference! There's a daisy.
I
    would give you some violets, but th
ey wither'd all when my
father
    died. They say he made a good end.

    [Sings] For bonny swe
et Robin is all my joy.

  Laer. Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,
    She turns to f
avour and to prettiness.
  Oph. (sings)
         And will he not come again?
         And will he
 not come again?
           No, no, he is dead;
           Go to thy deathbed;
         He never 
will come again.

         His beard was as white as snow,
         All flaxen was his poll.
   
        He is gone, he is gone,
           And we cast away moan.
         God 'a'mercy on his sou
l!

    And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God b' wi' you.
Exit.
  Laer. Do you see this, O
 God?
  King. Laertes, I must commune with your grief,
    Or you deny me right. Go but apart,
  
  Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will,
    And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you an
d me.
    If by direct or by collateral hand
    They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,

    Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours,
    To you in satisfaction; but if not,
    Be
 you content to lend your patience to us,
    And we shall jointly labour with your soul
    To gi
ve it due content.
  Laer. Let this be so.
    His means of death, his obscure funeral-
    No tr
ophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,
    No noble rite nor formal ostentation,-
    Cry to b
e heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
    That I must call't in question.
  King. So you shall;

    And where th' offence is let the great axe fall.
    I pray you go with me.
                
                                          Exeunt

Scene VI.
Elsinore. Another r
oom in the Castle.

Enter Horatio with an Attendant.

  Hor. What are they that would speak with
 me?
  Servant. Seafaring men, sir. They say they have letters for
you.
  Hor. Let them come in.

                                               [Exit Attendant.]
    I do not know from what part 
of the world
    I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.

                          Enter S
ailors.

  Sailor. God bless you, sir.
  Hor. Let him bless thee too.
  Sailor. 'A shall, sir, a
n't please him. There's a letter for
you,
    sir,- it comes from th' ambassador that was bound fo
r
England- if
    your name be Horatio, as I am let to know it is.
  Hor. (reads the letter) 'Hor
atio, when thou shalt have
overlook'd
    this, give these fellows some means to the King. They ha
ve
    letters for him. Ere we were two days old at sea, a pirate of

    very warlike appointmen
t gave us chase. Finding ourselves too
    slow of sail, we put on a compelled valour, and in the

grapple I
    boarded them. On the instant they got clear of our ship; so I
    alone became their
 prisoner. They have dealt with me like
thieves
    of mercy; but they knew what they did: I am to
 do a good turn
for
    them. Let the King have the letters I have sent, and repair
thou
    to 
me with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death. I have
words
    to speak in thine ear will make 
thee dumb; yet are they much
too
    light for the bore of the matter. These good fellows will
br

    thee where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their
course
    for England. Of them 
I have much to tell thee. Farewell.
                            'He that thou knowest thine, HAMLET

    Come, I will give you way for these your letters,

direct me

Sce
ne VII.
Elsinore. Another room in the Castle.

Enter King and Laertes.

  King. Now must your c
onscience my acquittance seal,
    And You must put me in your heart for friend,
    Sith you have
 heard, and with a knowing ear,
    That he which hath your noble father slain
    Pursued my life
.
  Laer. It well appears. But tell me
    Why you proceeded not against these feats
    So crime
ful and so capital in nature,
    As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
    You mainly were 
stirr'd up.
  King. O, for two special reasons,
    Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd
,
    But yet to me they are strong. The Queen his mother
    Lives almost by his looks; and for m
yself,-
    My virtue or my plague, be it either which,-
    She's so conjunctive to my life and s
oul
    That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
    I could not but by her. The other motiv
e
    Why to a public count I might not go
    Is the great love the general gender bear him,
   
 Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
    Would, like the spring that turneth wood to st
one,
    Convert his gives to graces; so that my arrows,
    Too slightly timber'd for so loud a w
ind,
    Would have reverted to my bow again,
    And not where I had aim'd them.
  Laer. And so 
have I a noble father lost;
    A sister driven into desp'rate terms,
    Whose worth, if praises 
may go back again,
    Stood challenger on mount of all the age
    For her perfections. But my re
venge will come.
  King. Break not your sleeps for that. You must not think
    That we are made o
f stuff so flat and dull
    That we can let our beard be shook with danger,
    And think it past
ime. You shortly shall hear more.
    I lov'd your father, and we love ourself,
    And that, I ho
pe, will teach you to imagine-

                 Enter a Messenger with letters.

    How now? W
hat news?
  Mess. Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:
    This to your Majesty; this to the Queen.
  K
ing. From Hamlet? Who brought them?
  Mess. Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not.
    They w
ere given me by Claudio; he receiv'd them
    Of him that brought them.
  King. Laertes, you shall
 hear them.
    Leave us.
                                                 Exit Messenger.
    [R
eads]'High and Mighty,-You shall know I am set naked on
your
    kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg le
ave to see your kingly eyes;
    when I shall (first asking your pardon thereunto) recount the
   
 occasion of my sudden and more strange return.
                                                   
  'HAMLET.'
    What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?
    Or is it some abuse, and no
 such thing?
  Laer. Know you the hand?
  King. 'Tis Hamlet's character. 'Naked!'
    And in a po
stscript here, he says 'alone.'
    Can you advise me?
  Laer. I am lost in it, my lord. But let h
im come!
    It warms the very sickness in my heart
    That I shall live and tell him to his teet
h,
    'Thus didest thou.'
  King. If it be so, Laertes
    (As how should it be so? how otherwis
e?),
    Will you be rul'd by me?
  Laer. Ay my lord,
    So you will not o'errule me to a peace.

  King. To thine own peace. If he be now return'd
    As checking at his voyage, and that he mean
s
    No more to undertake it, I will work him
    To exploit now ripe in my device,
    Under th
e which he shall not choose but fall;
    And for his death no wind shall breathe
    But even his
 mother shall uncharge the practice
    And call it accident.
  Laer. My lord, I will be rul'd;
 
   The rather, if you could devise it so
    That I might be the organ.
  King. It falls right.
 
   You have been talk'd of since your travel much,
    And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality

    Wherein they say you shine, Your sum of parts
    Did not together pluck such envy from him
 
   As did that one; and that, in my regard,
    Of the unworthiest siege.
  Laer. What part is tha
t, my lord?
  King. A very riband in the cap of youth-
    Yet needfull too; for youth no less bec
omes
    The light and careless livery that it wears
    Than settled age his sables and his weeds
,
    Importing health and graveness. Two months since
    Here was a gentleman of Normandy.
    
I have seen myself, and serv'd against, the French,
    And they can well on horseback; but this ga
llant
    Had witchcraft in't. He grew unto his seat,
    And to such wondrous doing brought his h
orse
    As had he been incorps'd and demi-natur'd
    With the brave beast. So far he topp'd my t
hought
    That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
    Come short of what he did.
  Laer. A Norm
an was't?
  King. A Norman.
  Laer. Upon my life, Lamound.
  King. The very same.
  Laer. I know
 him well. He is the broach indeed
    And gem of all the nation.
  King. He made confession of yo
u;
    And gave you such a masterly report
    For art and exercise in your defence,
    And for 
your rapier most especially,
    That he cried out 'twould be a sight indeed
    If one could matc
h you. The scrimers of their nation
    He swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
    If you op
pos'd them. Sir, this report of his
    Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
    That he could noth
ing do but wish and beg
    Your sudden coming o'er to play with you.
    Now, out of this-
  Lae
r. What out of this, my lord?
  King. Laertes, was your father dear to you?
    Or are you like th
e painting of a sorrow,
    A face without a heart,'
  Laer. Why ask you this?
  King. Not that I
 think you did not love your father;
    But that I know love is begun by time,
    And that I see
, in passages of proof,
    Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
    There lives within the ve
ry flame of love
    A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
    And nothing is at a like good
ness still;
    For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
    Dies in his own too-much. That we would do
,
    We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes,
    And hath abatements and delays as 
many
    As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
    And then this 'should' is like a spen
dthrift sigh,
    That hurts by easing. But to the quick o' th' ulcer!
    Hamlet comes back. What
 would you undertake
    To show yourself your father's son in deed
    More than in words?
  Lae
r. To cut his throat i' th' church!
  King. No place indeed should murther sanctuarize;
    Reveng
e should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,
    Will you do this? Keep close within your chamber.

    Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home.
    We'll put on those shall praise your excellen
ce
    And set a double varnish on the fame
    The Frenchman gave you; bring you in fine together

    And wager on your heads. He, being remiss,
    Most generous, and free from all contriving,

    Will not peruse the foils; so that with ease,
    Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
 
   A sword unbated, and, in a pass of practice,
    Requite him for your father.
  Laer. I will do
't!
    And for that purpose I'll anoint my sword.
    I bought an unction of a mountebank,
    S
o mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
    Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
    Collected
 from all simples that have virtue
    Under the moon, can save the thing from death
    This is b
ut scratch'd withal. I'll touch my point
    With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
  
  It may be death.
  King. Let's further think of this,
    Weigh what convenience both of time an
d means
    May fit us to our shape. If this should fall,
    And that our drift look through our 
bad performance.
    'Twere better not assay'd. Therefore this project
    Should have a back or s
econd, that might hold
    If this did blast in proof. Soft! let me see.
    We'll make a solemn w
ager on your cunnings-
    I ha't!
    When in your motion you are hot and dry-
    As make your 
bouts more violent to that end-
    And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepar'd him
    A chal
ice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,
    If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
    Our pur
pose may hold there.- But stay, what noise,

                           Enter Queen.

    How no
w, sweet queen?
  Queen. One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
    So fast they follow. Your sis
ter's drown'd, Laertes.
  Laer. Drown'd! O, where?
  Queen. There is a willow grows aslant a brook
,
    That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream.
    There with fantastic garlands did she c
ome
    Of crowflowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,
    That liberal shepherds give a gros
ser name,
    But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them.
    There on the pendant boughs 
her coronet weeds
    Clamb'ring to hang, an envious sliver broke,
    When down her weedy trophie
s and herself
    Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide
    And, mermaid-like, awhile
 they bore her up;
    Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes,
    As one incapable of her 
own distress,
    Or like a creature native and indued
    Unto that element; but long it could no
t be
    Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
    Pull'd the poor wretch from her melod
ious lay
    To muddy death.
  Laer. Alas, then she is drown'd?
  Queen. Drown'd, drown'd.
  Lae
r. Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
    And therefore I forbid my tears; but yet
    It 
is our trick; nature her custom holds,
    Let shame say what it will. When these are gone,
    Th
e woman will be out. Adieu, my lord.
    I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze
    But th
at this folly douts it.                          Exit.
  King. Let's follow, Gertrude.
    How muc
h I had to do to calm his rage I
    Now fear I this will give it start again;
    Therefore let's
 follow.
                                                         Exeunt.

ACT 
V. Scene I.
Elsinore. A churchyard.

Enter two Clowns, [with spades and pickaxes].

  Clown. Is
 she to be buried in Christian burial when she
wilfully
    seeks her own salvation?
  Other. I t
ell thee she is; therefore make her grave straight.
    The crowner hath sate on her, and finds it 
Christian burial.
  Clown. How can that be, unless she drown'd herself in her own
    defence?
  
Other. Why, 'tis found so.
  Clown. It must be se offendendo; it cannot be else. For here
lies
  
  the point: if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act; and
an
    act hath three branches-it 
is to act, to do, and to perform;
    argal, she drown'd herself wittingly.
  Other. Nay, but hear
 you, Goodman Delver!
  Clown. Give me leave. Here lies the water; good. Here stands
the
    man;
 good. If the man go to this water and drown himself, it
is,
    will he nill he, he goes- mark yo
u that. But if the water
come to
    him and drown him, he drowns not himself. Argal, he that is

not
    guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.
  Other. But is this law?
  Clown. Ay,
 marry, is't- crowner's quest law.
  Other. Will you ha' the truth an't? If this had not been a
  
  gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o' Christian
burial.
  Clown. Why, there thou say's
t! And the more pity that great
folk
    should have count'nance in this world to drown or hang
t
hemselves
    more than their even-Christian. Come, my spade! There is no
    ancient gentlemen bu
t gard'ners, ditchers, and grave-makers.
They
    hold up Adam's profession.
  Other. Was he a ge
ntleman?
  Clown. 'A was the first that ever bore arms.
  Other. Why, he had none.
  Clown. What,
 art a heathen? How dost thou understand the
Scripture?
    The Scripture says Adam digg'd. Could 
he dig without arms?
I'll
    put another question to thee. If thou answerest me not to the
    p
urpose, confess thyself-
  Other. Go to!
  Clown. What is he that builds stronger than either the 
mason,
the
    shipwright, or the carpenter?
  Other. The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives 
a thousand
    tenants.
  Clown. I like thy wit well, in good faith. The gallows does
well.
    
But how does it well? It does well to those that do ill. Now,
    thou dost ill to say the gallows 
is built stronger than the
    church. Argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To't again,
come!

  Other. Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a
    carpenter?
  Clown. Ay, tell me 
that, and unyoke.
  Other. Marry, now I can tell!
  Clown. To't.
  Other. Mass, I cannot tell.


                 Enter Hamlet and Horatio afar off.

  Clown. Cudgel thy brains no more about it,
 for your dull ass
will
    not mend his pace with beating; and when you are ask'd this
    quest
ion next, say 'a grave-maker.' The houses he makes lasts
    till doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan
; fetch me a stoup of
    liquor.
                                            [Exit Second Clown.]



                       [Clown digs and] sings.

       In youth when I did love, did love,

         Methought it was very sweet;
       To contract- O- the time for- a- my behove,
         
O, methought there- a- was nothing- a- meet.

  Ham. Has this fellow no feeling of his business, t
hat he sings
at
    grave-making?
  Hor. Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.
  Ha
m. 'Tis e'en so. The hand of little employment hath the
daintier
    sense.
  Clown. (sings)
   
      But age with his stealing steps
           Hath clawed me in his clutch,
         And hath s
hipped me intil the land,
           As if I had never been such.
                                
            [Throws up a skull.]

  Ham. That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once. How

the
    knave jowls it to the ground,as if 'twere Cain's jawbone,
that
    did the first murther!
 This might be the pate of a
Politician,
    which this ass now o'erreaches; one that would circum
vent
God,
    might it not?
  Hor. It might, my lord.
  Ham. Or of a courtier, which could say '
Good morrow, sweet
lord!
    How dost thou, good lord?' This might be my Lord Such-a-one,
that
 
   prais'd my Lord Such-a-one's horse when he meant to beg it-
might
    it not?
  Hor. Ay, my lo
rd.
  Ham. Why, e'en so! and now my Lady Worm's, chapless, and
knock'd
    about the mazzard with
 a sexton's spade. Here's fine
revolution,
    and we had the trick to see't. Did these bones cost
 no more
the
    breeding but to play at loggets with 'em? Mine ache to think
    on't.
  Clown.
 (Sings)
         A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,
           For and a shrouding sheet;
         
O, a Pit of clay for to be made
           For such a guest is meet.
                             
         Throws up [another skull].

  Ham. There's another. Why may not that be the skull of a
l
awyer?
    Where be his quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, his
tenures,
    and his tricks? W
hy does he suffer this rude knave now to
knock
    him about the sconce with a dirty shovel, and w
ill not tell
him
    of his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be in's time
a
    great b
uyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizances,
his
    fines, his double vouchers, his recove
ries. Is this the fine
of
    his fines, and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his
fine
  
  pate full of fine dirt? Will his vouchers vouch him no more
of
    his purchases, and double one
s too, than the length and
breadth
    of a pair of indentures? The very conveyances of his lands

will
    scarcely lie in this box; and must th' inheritor himself have
no
    more, ha?
  Hor. 
Not a jot more, my lord.
  Ham. Is not parchment made of sheepskins?
  Hor. Ay, my lord, And of ca
lveskins too.
  Ham. They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in
that. I
    will speak
 to this fellow. Whose grave's this, sirrah?
  Clown. Mine, sir.

    [Sings] O, a pit of clay fo
r to be made
              For such a guest is meet.

  Ham. I think it be thine indeed, for thou
 liest in't.
  Clown. You lie out on't, sir, and therefore 'tis not yours.
    For my part, I do n
ot lie in't, yet it is mine.
  Ham. Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine. 'Tis
for

    the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.
  Clown. 'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away 
again from me to you.
  Ham. What man dost thou dig it for?
  Clown. For no man, sir.
  Ham. What
 woman then?
  Clown. For none neither.
  Ham. Who is to be buried in't?
  Clown. One that was a 
woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's
dead.
  Ham. How absolute the knave is! We must speak by the
 card, or
    equivocation will undo us. By the Lord, Horatio, this three
years
    I have taken 
note of it, the age is grown so picked that the
toe
    of the peasant comes so near the heel of t
he courtier he
galls
    his kibe.- How long hast thou been a grave-maker?
  Clown. Of all the da
ys i' th' year, I came to't that day that
our
    last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.
  Ham. Ho
w long is that since?
  Clown. Cannot you tell that? Every fool can tell that. It was
the
    ver
y day that young Hamlet was born- he that is mad, and sent
    into England.
  Ham. Ay, marry, why
 was be sent into England?
  Clown. Why, because 'a was mad. 'A shall recover his wits
there;
   
 or, if 'a do not, 'tis no great matter there.
  Ham. Why?
  Clown. 'Twill not he seen in him ther
e. There the men are as
mad as
    he.
  Ham. How came he mad?
  Clown. Very strangely, they say
.
  Ham. How strangely?
  Clown. Faith, e'en with losing his wits.
  Ham. Upon what ground?
  Cl
own. Why, here in Denmark. I have been sexton here, man and
boy
    thirty years.
  Ham. How long
 will a man lie i' th' earth ere he rot?
  Clown. Faith, if 'a be not rotten before 'a die (as we h
ave
many
    pocky corses now-a-days that will scarce hold the laying in,
I
    will last you so
me eight year or nine year. A tanner will
last
    you nine year.
  Ham. Why he more than another
?
  Clown. Why, sir, his hide is so tann'd with his trade that 'a
will
    keep out water a great
 while; and your water is a sore
decayer of
    your whoreson dead body. Here's a skull now. This 
skull hath
lien
    you i' th' earth three-and-twenty years.
  Ham. Whose was it?
  Clown. A who
reson, mad fellow's it was. Whose do you think it
was?
  Ham. Nay, I know not.
  Clown. A pestile
nce on him for a mad rogue! 'A pour'd a flagon
of
    Rhenish on my head once. This same skull, si
r, was Yorick's
    skull, the King's jester.
  Ham. This?
  Clown. E'en that.
  Ham. Let me see
. [Takes the skull.] Alas, poor Yorick! I knew
him,
    Horatio. A fellow of infinite jest, of mos
t excellent fancy.
He
    hath borne me on his back a thousand times. And now how
abhorred
    i
n my imagination it is! My gorge rises at it. Here hung
those
    lips that I have kiss'd I know n
ot how oft. Where be your
gibes
    now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment that

    were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock
your
    own grinning? Quite chap-
 fall'n? Now get you to my lady's
    chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this

    favour she must come. Make her laugh at that. Prithee,
Horatio,
    tell me one thing.
  Hor.
 What's that, my lord?
  Ham. Dost thou think Alexander look'd o' this fashion i' th'
earth?
  Ho
r. E'en so.
  Ham. And smelt so? Pah!
                                          [Puts down the sku
ll.]
  Hor. E'en so, my lord.
  Ham. To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not
    im
agination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it
    stopping a bunghole?
  Hor. 'Twere
 to consider too curiously, to consider so.
  Ham. No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither 
with
modesty
    enough, and likelihood to lead it; as thus: Alexander died,
    Alexander was bu
ried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust
is
    earth; of earth we make loam; and why of that
 loam (whereto
he
    was converted) might they not stop a beer barrel?
    Imperious Caesar, dea
d and turn'd to clay,
    Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.
    O, that that earth which ke
pt the world in awe
    Should patch a wall t' expel the winter's flaw!
    But soft! but soft! as
ide! Here comes the King-

    Enter [priests with] a coffin [in funeral procession], King,
     
        Queen, Laertes, with Lords attendant.]

    The Queen, the courtiers. Who is this they fol
low?
    And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken
    The corse they follow did with desp'rat
e hand
    Fordo it own life. 'Twas of some estate.
    Couch we awhile, and mark.
              
                           [Retires with Horatio.]

  Laer. What ceremony else?
  Ham. That is La
ertes,
    A very noble youth. Mark.
  Laer. What ceremony else?
  Priest. Her obsequies have bee
n as far enlarg'd
    As we have warranty. Her death was doubtful;
    And, but that great command
 o'ersways the order,
    She should in ground unsanctified have lodg'd
    Till the last trumpet.
 For charitable prayers,
    Shards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on her.
    Yet here she
 is allow'd her virgin rites,
    Her maiden strewments, and the bringing home
    Of bell and bur
ial.
  Laer. Must there no more be done?
  Priest. No more be done.
    We should profane the ser
vice of the dead
    To sing a requiem and such rest to her
    As to peace-parted souls.
  Laer.
 Lay her i' th' earth;
    And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
    May violets spring! I tell t
hee, churlish priest,
    A minist'ring angel shall my sister be
    When thou liest howling.
  H
am. What, the fair Ophelia?
  Queen. Sweets to the sweet! Farewell.
                              
               [Scatters flowers.]
    I hop'd thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
    I tho
ught thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
    And not have strew'd thy grave.
  Laer. O, treb
le woe
    Fall ten times treble on that cursed head
    Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sens
e
    Depriv'd thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,
    Till I have caught her once more in mine ar
ms.
                                             Leaps in the grave.
    Now pile your dust upon t
he quick and dead
    Till of this flat a mountain you have made
    T' o'ertop old Pelion or the 
skyish head
    Of blue Olympus.
  Ham. [comes forward] What is he whose grief
    Bears such an 
emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow
    Conjures the wand'ring stars, and makes them stand
    Like w
onder-wounded hearers? This is I,
    Hamlet the Dane.                    [Leaps in after Laertes.

  Laer. The devil take thy soul!
                                            [Grapples with him].

  Ham. Thou pray'st not well.
    I prithee take thy fingers from my throat;
    For, though I am
 not splenitive and rash,
    Yet have I in me something dangerous,
    Which let thy wisdom fear.
 Hold off thy hand!
  King. Pluck them asunder.
  Queen. Hamlet, Hamlet!
  All. Gentlemen!
  Hor
. Good my lord, be quiet.
             [The Attendants part them, and they come out of the
       
                                                  grave.]
  Ham. Why, I will fight with him upon th
is theme
    Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
  Queen. O my son, what theme?
  Ham. I lov'd O
phelia. Forty thousand brothers
    Could not (with all their quantity of love)
    Make up my sum
. What wilt thou do for her?
  King. O, he is mad, Laertes.
  Queen. For love of God, forbear him!

  Ham. 'Swounds, show me what thou't do.
    Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thys
elf?
    Woo't drink up esill? eat a crocodile?
    I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?
    
To outface me with leaping in her grave?
    Be buried quick with her, and so will I.
    And if t
hou prate of mountains, let them throw
    Millions of acres on us, till our ground,
    Singeing 
his pate against the burning zone,
    Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
    I'll rant
 as well as thou.
  Queen. This is mere madness;
    And thus a while the fit will work on him.
 
   Anon, as patient as the female dove
    When that her golden couplets are disclos'd,
    His si
lence will sit drooping.
  Ham. Hear you, sir!
    What is the reason that you use me thus?
    I
 lov'd you ever. But it is no matter.
    Let Hercules himself do what he may,
    The cat will me
w, and dog will have his day.
Exit.
  King. I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.
           
                                        Exit Horatio.
    [To Laertes] Strengthen your patience in 
our last night's
speech.
    We'll put the matter to the present push.-
    Good Gertrude, set so
me watch over your son.-
    This grave shall have a living monument.
    An hour of quiet shortly
 shall we see;
    Till then in patience our proceeding be.
                                      
                   Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A hall in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet and H
oratio.

  Ham. So much for this, sir; now shall you see the other.
    You do remember all the c
ircumstance?
  Hor. Remember it, my lord!
  Ham. Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting
  
  That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay
    Worse than the mutinies in the bilboes. Rashly-

    And prais'd be rashness for it; let us know,
    Our indiscretion sometime serves us well
   
 When our deep plots do pall; and that should learn us
    There's a divinity that shapes our ends,

    Rough-hew them how we will-
  Hor. That is most certain.
  Ham. Up from my cabin,
    My se
a-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
    Grop'd I to find out them; had my desire,
    Finger'd th
eir packet, and in fine withdrew
    To mine own room again; making so bold
    (My fears forgetti
ng manners) to unseal
    Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio
    (O royal knavery!), a
n exact command,
    Larded with many several sorts of reasons,
    Importing Denmark's health, an
d England's too,
    With, hoo! such bugs and goblins in my life-
    That, on the supervise, no l
eisure bated,
    No, not to stay the finding of the axe,
    My head should be struck off.
  Hor
. Is't possible?
  Ham. Here's the commission; read it at more leisure.
    But wilt thou bear me 
how I did proceed?
  Hor. I beseech you.
  Ham. Being thus benetted round with villanies,
    Or 
I could make a prologue to my brains,
    They had begun the play. I sat me down;
    Devis'd a ne
w commission; wrote it fair.
    I once did hold it, as our statists do,
    A baseness to write f
air, and labour'd much
    How to forget that learning; but, sir, now
    It did me yeoman's servi
ce. Wilt thou know
    Th' effect of what I wrote?
  Hor. Ay, good my lord.
  Ham. An earnest con
juration from the King,
    As England was his faithful tributary,
    As love between them like t
he palm might flourish,
    As peace should still her wheaten garland wear
    And stand a comma '
tween their amities,
    And many such-like as's of great charge,
    That, on the view and knowin
g of these contents,
    Without debatement further, more or less,
    He should the bearers put t
o sudden death,
    Not shriving time allow'd.
  Hor. How was this seal'd?
  Ham. Why, even in th
at was heaven ordinant.
    I had my father's signet in my purse,
    Which was the model of that 
Danish seal;
    Folded the writ up in the form of th' other,
    Subscrib'd it, gave't th' impres
sion, plac'd it safely,
    The changeling never known. Now, the next day
    Was our sea-fight; a
nd what to this was sequent
    Thou know'st already.
  Hor. So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to
't.
  Ham. Why, man, they did make love to this employment!
    They are not near my conscience; t
heir defeat
    Does by their own insinuation grow.
    'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes

    Between the pass and fell incensed points
    Of mighty opposites.
  Hor. Why, what a king i
s this!
  Ham. Does it not, thinks't thee, stand me now upon-
    He that hath kill'd my king, and
 whor'd my mother;
    Popp'd in between th' election and my hopes;
    Thrown out his angle for m
y proper life,
    And with such coz'nage- is't not perfect conscience
    To quit him with this a
rm? And is't not to be damn'd
    To let this canker of our nature come
    In further evil?
  Ho
r. It must be shortly known to him from England
    What is the issue of the business there.
  Ham
. It will be short; the interim is mine,
    And a man's life is no more than to say 'one.'
    Bu
t I am very sorry, good Horatio,
    That to Laertes I forgot myself,
    For by the image of my c
ause I see
    The portraiture of his. I'll court his favours.
    But sure the bravery of his gri
ef did put me
    Into a tow'ring passion.
  Hor. Peace! Who comes here?

                 Enter
 young Osric, a courtier.

  Osr. Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
  Ham. I humbly
 thank you, sir. [Aside to Horatio] Dost know this
    waterfly?
  Hor. [aside to Hamlet] No, my g
ood lord.
  Ham. [aside to Horatio] Thy state is the more gracious; for
'tis a
    vice to know h
im. He hath much land, and fertile. Let a beast
be
    lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at
 the king's mess.
'Tis
    a chough; but, as I say, spacious in the possession of dirt.

  Osr. 
Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should
impart
    a thing to you from his Majesty.

  Ham. I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit. Put
your
    bonnet to his right us
e. 'Tis for the head.
  Osr. I thank your lordship, it is very hot.
  Ham. No, believe me, 'tis ve
ry cold; the wind is northerly.
  Osr. It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
  Ham. But yet met
hinks it is very sultry and hot for my
complexion.
  Osr. Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,
 as 'twere- I
cannot
    tell how. But, my lord, his Majesty bade me signify to you
that
    he 
has laid a great wager on your head. Sir, this is the
matter-
  Ham. I beseech you remember.
    
                       [Hamlet moves him to put on his hat.]
  Osr. Nay, good my lord; for mine eas
e, in good faith. Sir, here
is
    newly come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute
gentleman
,
    full of most excellent differences, of very soft society and
    great showing. Indeed, to s
peak feelingly of him, he is the
card
    or calendar of gentry; for you shall find in him the
co
ntinent of
    what part a gentleman would see.
  Ham. Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in
 you; though, I

    know, to divide him inventorially would dozy th' arithmetic
of
    memory, 
and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail.
    But, in the verity of extolment, I take h
im to be a soul of
great
    article, and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as, to
make
 
   true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror, and who
else
    would trace him, his umbrage
, nothing more.
  Osr. Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
  Ham. The concernancy, sir? W
hy do we wrap the gentleman in our
more
    rawer breath?
  Osr. Sir?
  Hor [aside to Hamlet] Is
't not possible to understand in
another
    tongue? You will do't, sir, really.
  Ham. What impo
rts the nomination of this gentleman?
  Osr. Of Laertes?
  Hor. [aside] His purse is empty already
. All's golden words are
    spent.
  Ham. Of him, sir.
  Osr. I know you are not ignorant-
  Ha
m. I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would
not
    much approve me. Well, sir?

  Osr. You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is-
  Ham. I dare not confess that, lest I s
hould compare with him in
    excellence; but to know a man well were to know himself.
  Osr. I me
an, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on
him
    by them, in his meed he's unfellowe
d.
  Ham. What's his weapon?
  Osr. Rapier and dagger.
  Ham. That's two of his weapons- but well
.
  Osr. The King, sir, hath wager'd with him six Barbary horses;
    against the which he has imp
on'd, as I take it, six French
    rapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers,
a
nd
    so. Three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy,
    very responsive to the hi
lts, most delicate carriages, and of
    very liberal conceit.
  Ham. What call you the carriages?

  Hor. [aside to Hamlet] I knew you must be edified by the
margent
    ere you had done.
  Osr.
 The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
  Ham. The phrase would be more germane to the matter if we c
ould
    carry cannon by our sides. I would it might be hangers till
then.
    But on! Six Barbar
y horses against six French swords, their
    assigns, and three liberal-conceited carriages: that'
s the
French
    bet against the Danish. Why is this all impon'd, as you call
it?
  Osr. The Kin
g, sir, hath laid that, in a dozen passes between
    yourself and him, he shall not exceed you thr
ee hits; he hath
    laid on twelve for nine, and it would come to immediate trial
    if your lor
dship would vouchsafe the answer.
  Ham. How if I answer no?
  Osr. I mean, my lord, the oppositio
n of your person in trial.
  Ham. Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please his
Majesty,
  
  it is the breathing time of day with me. Let the foils be
    brought, the gentleman willing, and
 the King hold his
purpose,
    I will win for him if I can; if not, I will gain nothing but
my

    shame and the odd hits.
  Osr. Shall I redeliver you e'en so?
  Ham. To this effect, sir, afte
r what flourish your nature will.
  Osr. I commend my duty to your lordship.
  Ham. Yours, yours. 
[Exit Osric.] He does well to commend it
    himself; there are no tongues else for's turn.
  Hor.
 This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.
  Ham. He did comply with his dug before he suc
k'd it. Thus has
he,
    and many more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age
dotes
    on,
 only got the tune of the time and outward habit of
encounter-
    a kind of yesty collection, whi
ch carries them through and
    through the most fann'd and winnowed opinions; and do but
blow
  
  them to their trial-the bubbles are out,

                            Enter a Lord.

  Lord. M
y lord, his Majesty commended him to you by young Osric,
who
    brings back to him, that you atte
nd him in the hall. He sends
to
    know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you

will
    take longer time.
  Ham. I am constant to my purposes; they follow the King's
pleasure.

    If his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or whensoever,
provided
    I be so able as now.
 
 Lord. The King and Queen and all are coming down.
  Ham. In happy time.
  Lord. The Queen desires
 you to use some gentle entertainment to
    Laertes before you fall to play.
  Ham. She well inst
ructs me.
                                                    [Exit Lord.]
  Hor. You will lose th
is wager, my lord.
  Ham. I do not think so. Since he went into France I have been
in
    continu
al practice. I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst
not
    think how ill all's here about my h
eart. But it is no matter.
  Hor. Nay, good my lord -
  Ham. It is but foolery; but it is such a k
ind of gaingiving as
    would perhaps trouble a woman.
  Hor. If your mind dislike anything, obey
 it. I will forestall
their
    repair hither and say you are not fit.
  Ham. Not a whit, we defy
 augury; there's a special providence
in
    the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not to come
; if it
be
    not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will
come:
    the readines
s is all. Since no man knows aught of what he
leaves,
    what is't to leave betimes? Let be.

 
   Enter King, Queen, Laertes, Osric, and Lords, with other
              Attendants with foils and
 gauntlets.
               A table and flagons of wine on it.

  King. Come, Hamlet, come, and ta
ke this hand from me.
                    [The King puts Laertes' hand into Hamlet's.]
  Ham. Give
 me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong;
    But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.
    This pr
esence knows,
    And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd
    With sore distraction. What
 I have done
    That might your nature, honour, and exception
    Roughly awake, I here proclaim 
was madness.
    Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet.
    If Hamlet from himself be taken a
way,
    And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
    Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies 
it.
    Who does it, then? His madness. If't be so,
    Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;

    His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
    Sir, in this audience,
    Let my disclaiming from a 
purpos'd evil
    Free me so far in your most generous thoughts
    That I have shot my arrow o'er
 the house
    And hurt my brother.
  Laer. I am satisfied in nature,
    Whose motive in this ca
se should stir me most
    To my revenge. But in my terms of honour
    I stand aloof, and will no
 reconcilement
    Till by some elder masters of known honour
    I have a voice and precedent of 
peace
    To keep my name ungor'd. But till that time
    I do receive your offer'd love like love
,
    And will not wrong it.
  Ham. I embrace it freely,
    And will this brother's wager frankl
y play.
    Give us the foils. Come on.
  Laer. Come, one for me.
  Ham. I'll be your foil, Laert
es. In mine ignorance
    Your skill shall, like a star i' th' darkest night,
    Stick fiery off 
indeed.
  Laer. You mock me, sir.
  Ham. No, by this hand.
  King. Give them the foils, young Osr
ic. Cousin Hamlet,
    You know the wager?
  Ham. Very well, my lord.
    Your Grace has laid the
 odds o' th' weaker side.
  King. I do not fear it, I have seen you both;
    But since he is bett
er'd, we have therefore odds.
  Laer. This is too heavy; let me see another.
  Ham. This likes me 
well. These foils have all a length?
                                                Prepare to pla
y.
  Osr. Ay, my good lord.
  King. Set me the stoups of wine upon that table.
    If Hamlet give
 the first or second hit,
    Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
    Let all the battlements
 their ordnance fire;
    The King shall drink to Hamlet's better breath,
    And in the cup an un
ion shall he throw
    Richer than that which four successive kings
    In Denmark's crown have wo
rn. Give me the cups;
    And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
    The trumpet to the cannonee
r without,
    The cannons to the heavens, the heaven to earth,
    'Now the King drinks to Hamlet
.' Come, begin.
    And you the judges, bear a wary eye.
  Ham. Come on, sir.
  Laer. Come, my lo
rd.                                They play.
  Ham. One.
  Laer. No.
  Ham. Judgment!
  Osr. A 
hit, a very palpable hit.
  Laer. Well, again!
  King. Stay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is 
thine;
    Here's to thy health.
               [Drum; trumpets sound; a piece goes off [within].

    Give him the cup.
  Ham. I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile.
    Come. (They play.) 
Another hit. What say you?
  Laer. A touch, a touch; I do confess't.
  King. Our son shall win.
 
 Queen. He's fat, and scant of breath.
    Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows.
    The Qu
een carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
  Ham. Good madam!
  King. Gertrude, do not drink.
  Queen. 
I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.          Drinks.
  King. [aside] It is the poison'd cup; it 
is too late.
  Ham. I dare not drink yet, madam; by-and-by.
  Queen. Come, let me wipe thy face.

  Laer. My lord, I'll hit him now.
  King. I do not think't.
  Laer. [aside] And yet it is almost 
against my conscience.
  Ham. Come for the third, Laertes! You but dally.
    Pray you pass with y
our best violence;
    I am afeard you make a wanton of me.
  Laer. Say you so? Come on.          
                     Play.
  Osr. Nothing neither way.
  Laer. Have at you now!
                [
Laertes wounds Hamlet; then] in scuffling, they
                    change rapiers, [and Hamlet wou
nds Laertes].
  King. Part them! They are incens'd.
  Ham. Nay come! again!                       
  The Queen falls.

  Osr. Look to the Queen there, ho!
  Hor. They bleed on both sides. How is i
t, my lord?
  Osr. How is't, Laertes?
  Laer. Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric.
    
I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.
  Ham. How does the Queen?
  King. She sounds to see t
hem bleed.
  Queen. No, no! the drink, the drink! O my dear Hamlet!
    The drink, the drink! I am
 poison'd.                 [Dies.]
  Ham. O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd.
    Treachery! Se
ek it out.
                                                [Laertes falls.]
  Laer. It is here, Ha
mlet. Hamlet, thou art slain;
    No medicine in the world can do thee good.
    In thee there is 
not half an hour of life.
    The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
    Unbated and envenom'd
. The foul practice
    Hath turn'd itself on me. Lo, here I lie,
    Never to rise again. Thy mot
her's poison'd.
    I can no more. The King, the King's to blame.
  Ham. The point envenom'd too?

    Then, venom, to thy work.                    Hurts the King.
  All. Treason! treason!
  King.
 O, yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt.
  Ham. Here, thou incestuous, murd'rous, damned Dane,
 
   Drink off this potion! Is thy union here?
    Follow my mother.                                 
King dies.
  Laer. He is justly serv'd.
    It is a poison temper'd by himself.
    Exchange forg
iveness with me, noble Hamlet.
    Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
    Nor thine on
 me!                                       Dies.
  Ham. Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.

    I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!
    You that look pale and tremble at this chance,

    That are but mutes or audience to this act,
    Had I but time (as this fell sergeant, Death,

    Is strict in his arrest) O, I could tell you-
    But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;
    Tho
u liv'st; report me and my cause aright
    To the unsatisfied.
  Hor. Never believe it.
    I am
 more an antique Roman than a Dane.
    Here's yet some liquor left.
  Ham. As th'art a man,
    
Give me the cup. Let go! By heaven, I'll ha't.
    O good Horatio, what a wounded name
    (Things
 standing thus unknown) shall live behind me!
    If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,
    Abs
ent thee from felicity awhile,
    And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
    To tell my
 story.         [March afar off, and shot within.]
    What warlike noise is this?
  Osr. Young Fo
rtinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
    To the ambassadors of England gives
    This warlike
 volley.
  Ham. O, I die, Horatio!
    The potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit.
    I cannot 
live to hear the news from England,
    But I do prophesy th' election lights
    On Fortinbras. H
e has my dying voice.
    So tell him, with th' occurrents, more and less,
    Which have solicite
d- the rest is silence.             Dies.
  Hor. Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince
,
    And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
                                               
  [March within.]
    Why does the drum come hither?

    Enter Fortinbras and English Ambassador
s, with Drum,
                  Colours, and Attendants.

  Fort. Where is this sight?
  Hor. Wh
at is it you will see?
    If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
  Fort. This quarry cries
 on havoc. O proud Death,
    What feast is toward in thine eternal cell
    That thou so many pri
nces at a shot
    So bloodily hast struck.
  Ambassador. The sight is dismal;
    And our affair
s from England come too late.
    The ears are senseless that should give us hearing
    To tell h
im his commandment is fulfill'd
    That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.
    Where should w
e have our thanks?
  Hor. Not from his mouth,
    Had it th' ability of life to thank you.
    He
 never gave commandment for their death.
    But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
    You
 from the Polack wars, and you from England,
    Are here arriv'd, give order that these bodies
  
  High on a stage be placed to the view;
    And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
    How t
hese things came about. So shall you hear
    Of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts;
    Of acciden
tal judgments, casual slaughters;
    Of deaths put on by cunning and forc'd cause;
    And, in th
is upshot, purposes mistook
    Fall'n on th' inventors' heads. All this can I
    Truly deliver.

  Fort. Let us haste to hear it,
    And call the noblest to the audience.
    For me, with sorro
w I embrace my fortune.
    I have some rights of memory in this kingdom
    Which now, to claim m
y vantage doth invite me.
  Hor. Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
    And from his mouth 
whose voice will draw on more.
    But let this same be presently perform'd,
    Even while men's 
minds are wild, lest more mischance
    On plots and errors happen.
  Fort. Let four captains
   
 Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage;
    For he was likely, had he been put on,
    To have p
rov'd most royally; and for his passage
    The soldiers' music and the rites of war
    Speak lou
dly for him.
    Take up the bodies. Such a sight as this
    Becomes the field but here shows muc
h amiss.
    Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
            Exeunt marching; after the which a peal of or
dnance
                                                   are shot off.

ACT I. Scene I.
Elsinore. A platform before the Castle.

Enter two 
Sentinels-[first,] Francisco, [who paces up and down
at his post; then] Bernardo, [who approaches h
im].

  Ber. Who's there?
  Fran. Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.
  Ber. Long live th
e King!
  Fran. Bernardo?
  Ber. He.
  Fran. You come most carefully upon your hour.
  Ber. 'Tis
 now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.
  Fran. For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter co
ld,
    And I am sick at heart.
  Ber. Have you had quiet guard?
  Fran. Not a mouse stirring.
 
 Ber. Well, good night.
    If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
    The rivals of my watch, bid 
them make haste.

                    Enter Horatio and Marcellus.

  Fran. I think I hear them.
 Stand, ho! Who is there?
  Hor. Friends to this ground.
  Mar. And liegemen to the Dane.
  Fran.
 Give you good night.
  Mar. O, farewell, honest soldier.
    Who hath reliev'd you?
  Fran. Bern
ardo hath my place.
    Give you good night.                                   Exit.
  Mar. Holla,
 Bernardo!
  Ber. Say-
    What, is Horatio there ?
  Hor. A piece of him.
  Ber. Welcome, Horat
io. Welcome, good Marcellus.
  Mar. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
  Ber. I have se
en nothing.
  Mar. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
    And will not let belief take hold of him

    Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.
    Therefore I have entreated him along,
   
 With us to watch the minutes of this night,
    That, if again this apparition come,
    He may a
pprove our eyes and speak to it.
  Hor. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
  Ber. Sit down awhile,
  
  And let us once again assail your ears,
    That are so fortified against our story,
    What we
 two nights have seen.
  Hor. Well, sit we down,
    And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
  Be
r. Last night of all,
    When yond same star that's westward from the pole
    Had made his cours
e t' illume that part of heaven
    Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
    The bell then be
ating one-

                        Enter Ghost.

  Mar. Peace! break thee off! Look where it co
mes again!
  Ber. In the same figure, like the King that's dead.
  Mar. Thou art a scholar; speak 
to it, Horatio.
  Ber. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.
  Hor. Most like. It harrows 
me with fear and wonder.
  Ber. It would be spoke to.
  Mar. Question it, Horatio.
  Hor. What ar
t thou that usurp'st this time of night
    Together with that fair and warlike form
    In which 
the majesty of buried Denmark
    Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!
  Mar. It is
 offended.
  Ber. See, it stalks away!
  Hor. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!
          
                                           Exit Ghost.
  Mar. 'Tis gone and will not answer.
  Ber
. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale.
    Is not this something more than fantasy?
    Wh
at think you on't?
  Hor. Before my God, I might not this believe
    Without the sensible and tru
e avouch
    Of mine own eyes.
  Mar. Is it not like the King?
  Hor. As thou art to thyself.
  
  Such was the very armour he had on
    When he th' ambitious Norway combated.
    So frown'd he 
once when, in an angry parle,
    He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
    'Tis strange.
  Ma
r. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
    With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.

  Hor. In what particular thought to work I know not;
    But, in the gross and scope of my opini
on,
    This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
  Mar. Good now, sit down, and tell me he t
hat knows,
    Why this same strict and most observant watch
    So nightly toils the subject of t
he land,
    And why such daily cast of brazen cannon
    And foreign mart for implements of war;

    Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
    Does not divide the Sunday from the week.

    What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
    Doth make the night joint-labourer with the 
day?
    Who is't that can inform me?
  Hor. That can I.
    At least, the whisper goes so. Our l
ast king,
    Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
    Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norw
ay,
    Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
    Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant 
Hamlet
    (For so this side of our known world esteem'd him)
    Did slay this Fortinbras; who, b
y a seal'd compact,
    Well ratified by law and heraldry,
    Did forfeit, with his life, all tho
se his lands
    Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror;
    Against the which a moiety compet
ent
    Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
    To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
    Had h
e been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant
    And carriage of the article design'd,
    His fell
 to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
    Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
    Hath in the ski
rts of Norway, here and there,
    Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
    For food and diet, 
to some enterprise
    That hath a stomach in't; which is no other,
    As it doth well appear unt
o our state,
    But to recover of us, by strong hand
    And terms compulsatory, those foresaid l
ands
    So by his father lost; and this, I take it,
    Is the main motive of our preparations,

    The source of this our watch, and the chief head
    Of this post-haste and romage in the land.

  Ber. I think it be no other but e'en so.
    Well may it sort that this portentous figure
    
Comes armed through our watch, so like the King
    That was and is the question of these wars.
  
Hor. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
    In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
    A l
ittle ere the mightiest Julius fell,
    The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead
    Did
 squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;
    As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood,
    
Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
    Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
    Was 
sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.
    And even the like precurse of fierce events,
    As harb
ingers preceding still the fates
    And prologue to the omen coming on,
    Have heaven and earth
 together demonstrated
    Unto our climature and countrymen.

                      Enter Ghost 
again.

    But soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again!
    I'll cross it, though it blast me.- S
tay illusion!
                                               Spreads his arms.
    If thou hast an
y sound, or use of voice,
    Speak to me.
    If there be any good thing to be done,
    That ma
y to thee do ease, and, race to me,
    Speak to me.
    If thou art privy to thy country's fate,

    Which happily foreknowing may avoid,
    O, speak!
    Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life

    Extorted treasure in the womb of earth
    (For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death
),
                                                 The cock crows.
    Speak of it! Stay, and spe
ak!- Stop it, Marcellus!
  Mar. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
  Hor. Do, if it will not s
tand.
  Ber. 'Tis here!
  Hor. 'Tis here!
  Mar. 'Tis gone!
                                    
                 Exit Ghost.
    We do it wrong, being so majestical,
    To offer it the show of 
violence;
    For it is as the air, invulnerable,
    And our vain blows malicious mockery.
  Ber
. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
  Hor. And then it started, like a guilty thing
    U
pon a fearful summons. I have heard
    The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
    Doth with h
is lofty and shrill-sounding throat
    Awake the god of day; and at his warning,
    Whether in s
ea or fire, in earth or air,
    Th' extravagant and erring spirit hies
    To his confine; and of
 the truth herein
    This present object made probation.
  Mar. It faded on the crowing of the co
ck.
    Some say that ever, 'gainst that season comes
    Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrate
d,
    The bird of dawning singeth all night long;
    And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abr
oad,
    The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,
    No fairy takes, nor witch hath powe
r to charm,
    So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
  Hor. So have I heard and do in part bel
ieve it.
    But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
    Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastwar
d hill.
    Break we our watch up; and by my advice
    Let us impart what we have seen to-night

    Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
    This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
    Do y
ou consent we shall acquaint him with it,
    As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
    Let's
 do't, I pray; and I this morning know
    Where we shall find him most conveniently.           Exe
unt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A room of state in the Castle.

Flourish. [Enter Claudius, King
 of Denmark, Gertrude the Queen,
Hamlet,
Polonius, Laertes and his sister Ophelia, [Voltemand, Cor
nelius,]
Lords Attendant.

  King. Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
    The memory 
be green, and that it us befitted
    To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom
    To be
 contracted in one brow of woe,
    Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
    That we with
 wisest sorrow think on him
    Together with remembrance of ourselves.
    Therefore our sometime
 sister, now our queen,
    Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,
    Have we, as 'twere w
ith a defeated joy,
    With an auspicious, and a dropping eye,
    With mirth in funeral, and wit
h dirge in marriage,
    In equal scale weighing delight and dole,
    Taken to wife; nor have we 
herein barr'd
    Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
    With this affair along. For all,
 our thanks.
    Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
    Holding a weak supposal of our 
worth,
    Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
    Our state to be disjoint and out of fr
ame,
    Colleagued with this dream of his advantage,
    He hath not fail'd to pester us with mes
sage
    Importing the surrender of those lands
    Lost by his father, with all bands of law,
  
  To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
    Now for ourself and for this time of meeting.

    Thus much the business is: we have here writ
    To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,
    Who
, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears
    Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress
    His furthe
r gait herein, in that the levies,
    The lists, and full proportions are all made
    Out of his
 subject; and we here dispatch
    You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,
    For bearers of thi
s greeting to old Norway,
    Giving to you no further personal power
    To business with the Kin
g, more than the scope
    Of these dilated articles allow.            [Gives a paper.]
    Farewe
ll, and let your haste commend your duty.
  Cor., Volt. In that, and all things, will we show our d
uty.
  King. We doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell.
                                 Exeunt Volte
mand and Cornelius.
    And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
    You told us of some suit. 
What is't, Laertes?
    You cannot speak of reason to the Dane
    And lose your voice. What would
st thou beg, Laertes,
    That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
    The head is not more nat
ive to the heart,
    The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
    Than is the throne of Denmark t
o thy father.
    What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
  Laer. My dread lord,
    Your leave and favo
ur to return to France;
    From whence though willingly I came to Denmark
    To show my duty in 
your coronation,
    Yet now I must confess, that duty done,
    My thoughts and wishes bend again
 toward France
    And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
  King. Have you your father's 
leave? What says Polonius?
  Pol. He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
    By laboursome 
petition, and at last
    Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent.
    I do beseech you give him le
ave to go.
  King. Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,
    And thy best graces spend it at
 thy will!
    But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son-
  Ham. [aside] A little more than kin, and l
ess than kind!
  King. How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
  Ham. Not so, my lord. I am t
oo much i' th' sun.
  Queen. Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
    And let thine eye look 
like a friend on Denmark.
    Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
    Seek for thy noble father i
n the dust.
    Thou know'st 'tis common. All that lives must die,
    Passing through nature to e
ternity.
  Ham. Ay, madam, it is common.
  Queen. If it be,
    Why seems it so particular with t
hee?
  Ham. Seems, madam, Nay, it is. I know not 'seems.'
    'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good m
other,
    Nor customary suits of solemn black,
    Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,
    N
o, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
    Nor the dejected havior of the visage,
    Together with
 all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
    'That can denote me truly. These indeed seem,
    For they
 are actions that a man might play;
    But I have that within which passeth show-
    These but t
he trappings and the suits of woe.
  King. 'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
    
To give these mourning duties to your father;
    But you must know, your father lost a father;
  
  That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
    In filial obligation for some term
    To
 do obsequious sorrow. But to persever
    In obstinate condolement is a course
    Of impious stu
bbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief;
    It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
    A heart unfortifi
ed, a mind impatient,
    An understanding simple and unschool'd;
    For what we know must be, an
d is as common
    As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
    Why should we in our peevish opposit
ion
    Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
    A fault against the dead, a fault to na
ture,
    To reason most absurd, whose common theme
    Is death of fathers, and who still hath cr
ied,
    From the first corse till he that died to-day,
    'This must be so.' We pray you throw t
o earth
    This unprevailing woe, and think of us
    As of a father; for let the world take note

    You are the most immediate to our throne,
    And with no less nobility of love
    Than tha
t which dearest father bears his son
    Do I impart toward you. For your intent
    In going back
 to school in Wittenberg,
    It is most retrograde to our desire;
    And we beseech you, bend yo
u to remain
    Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
    Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and o
ur son.
  Queen. Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.
    I pray thee stay with us, go not
 to Wittenberg.
  Ham. I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
  King. Why, 'tis a loving and a fa
ir reply.
    Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come.
    This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet

    Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,
    No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day

    But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
    And the King's rouse the heaven shall bruit 
again,
    Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.
                                Flourish. Exeunt
 all but Hamlet.
  Ham. O that this too too solid flesh would melt,
    Thaw, and resolve itself i
nto a dew!
    Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
    His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! 
God!
    How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
    Seem to me all the uses of this world!
    
Fie on't! ah, fie! 'Tis an unweeded garden
    That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature

    Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
    But two months dead! Nay, not so much, not
 two.
    So excellent a king, that was to this
    Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
 
   That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
    Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!

    Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him
    As if increase of appetite had grown
    By wh
at it fed on; and yet, within a month-
    Let me not think on't! Frailty, thy name is woman!-
   
 A little month, or ere those shoes were old
    With which she followed my poor father's body
   
 Like Niobe, all tears- why she, even she
    (O God! a beast that wants discourse of reason
    W
ould have mourn'd longer) married with my uncle;
    My father's brother, but no more like my fathe
r
    Than I to Hercules. Within a month,
    Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
    Had 
left the flushing in her galled eyes,
    She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
    With such
 dexterity to incestuous sheets!
    It is not, nor it cannot come to good.
    But break my heart
, for I must hold my tongue!

          Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo.

  Hor. Hail to 
your lordship!
  Ham. I am glad to see you well.
    Horatio!- or I do forget myself.
  Hor. The 
same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
  Ham. Sir, my good friend- I'll change that name with y
ou.
    And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?
    Marcellus?
  Mar. My good lord!
  Ham. I
 am very glad to see you.- [To Bernardo] Good even, sir.-

    But what, in faith, make you from W
ittenberg?
  Hor. A truant disposition, good my lord.
  Ham. I would not hear your enemy say so,

    Nor shall you do my ear that violence
    To make it truster of your own report
    Against yo
urself. I know you are no truant.
    But what is your affair in Elsinore?
    We'll teach you to 
drink deep ere you depart.
  Hor. My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
  Ham. I prithee d
o not mock me, fellow student.
    I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
  Hor. Indeed, my lo
rd, it followed hard upon.
  Ham. Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats
    Did coldly 
furnish forth the marriage tables.
    Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
    Or ever I had 
seen that day, Horatio!
    My father- methinks I see my father.
  Hor. O, where, my lord?
  Ham.
 In my mind's eye, Horatio.
  Hor. I saw him once. He was a goodly king.
  Ham. He was a man, take
 him for all in all.
    I shall not look upon his like again.
  Hor. My lord, I think I saw him y
esternight.
  Ham. Saw? who?
  Hor. My lord, the King your father.
  Ham. The King my father?
  
Hor. Season your admiration for a while
    With an attent ear, till I may deliver
    Upon the wi
tness of these gentlemen,
    This marvel to you.
  Ham. For God's love let me hear!
  Hor. Two n
ights together had these gentlemen
    (Marcellus and Bernardo) on their watch
    In the dead vas
t and middle of the night
    Been thus encount'red. A figure like your father,
    Armed at point
 exactly, cap-a-pe,
    Appears before them and with solemn march
    Goes slow and stately by the
m. Thrice he walk'd
    By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
    Within his truncheon's len
gth; whilst they distill'd
    Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
    Stand dumb and speak not 
to him. This to me
    In dreadful secrecy impart they did,
    And I with them the third night ke
pt the watch;
    Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
    Form of the thing, each word mad
e true and good,
    The apparition comes. I knew your father.
    These hands are not more like.

  Ham. But where was this?
  Mar. My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
  Ham. Did you not
 speak to it?
  Hor. My lord, I did;
    But answer made it none. Yet once methought
    It lifte
d up it head and did address
    Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
    But even then the m
orning cock crew loud,
    And at the sound it shrunk in haste away
    And vanish'd from our sigh
t.
  Ham. 'Tis very strange.
  Hor. As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
    And we did thi
nk it writ down in our duty
    To let you know of it.
  Ham. Indeed, indeed, sirs. But this troub
les me.
    Hold you the watch to-night?
  Both [Mar. and Ber.] We do, my lord.
  Ham. Arm'd, say
 you?
  Both. Arm'd, my lord.
  Ham. From top to toe?
  Both. My lord, from head to foot.
  Ham.
 Then saw you not his face?
  Hor. O, yes, my lord! He wore his beaver up.
  Ham. What, look'd he 
frowningly.
  Hor. A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
  Ham. Pale or red?
  Hor. Nay, ve
ry pale.
  Ham. And fix'd his eyes upon you?
  Hor. Most constantly.
  Ham. I would I had been th
ere.
  Hor. It would have much amaz'd you.
  Ham. Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
  Hor. Wh
ile one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
  Both. Longer, longer.
  Hor. Not when I saw't.

  Ham. His beard was grizzled- no?
  Hor. It was, as I have seen it in his life,
    A sable sil
ver'd.
  Ham. I will watch to-night.
    Perchance 'twill walk again.
  Hor. I warr'nt it will.

  Ham. If it assume my noble father's person,
    I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape

    And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
    If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
    
Let it be tenable in your silence still;
    And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
    Give it a
n understanding but no tongue.
    I will requite your loves. So, fare you well.
    Upon the plat
form, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
    I'll visit you.
  All. Our duty to your honour.
  Ham. Your l
oves, as mine to you. Farewell.
                                        Exeunt [all but Hamlet].
 
   My father's spirit- in arms? All is not well.
    I doubt some foul play. Would the night were c
ome!
    Till then sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,
    Though all the earth o'erwhelm th
em, to men's eyes.
Exit.




Scene III.
Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius.

Enter L
aertes and Ophelia.

  Laer. My necessaries are embark'd. Farewell.
    And, sister, as the winds
 give benefit
    And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
    But let me hear from you.
  Oph. Do 
you doubt that?
  Laer. For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,
    Hold it a fashion, and a t
oy in blood;
    A violet in the youth of primy nature,
    Forward, not permanent- sweet, not las
ting;
    The perfume and suppliance of a minute;
    No more.
  Oph. No more but so?
  Laer. Th
ink it no more.
    For nature crescent does not grow alone
    In thews and bulk; but as this tem
ple waxes,
    The inward service of the mind and soul
    Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you
 now,
    And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
    The virtue of his will; but you must fear,

    His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
    For he himself is subject to his birth.
 
   He may not, as unvalued persons do,
    Carve for himself, for on his choice depends
    The sa
fety and health of this whole state,
    And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd
    Unto t
he voice and yielding of that body
    Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
    I
t fits your wisdom so far to believe it
    As he in his particular act and place
    May give his
 saying deed; which is no further
    Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
    Then weigh w
hat loss your honour may sustain
    If with too credent ear you list his songs,
    Or lose your 
heart, or your chaste treasure open
    To his unmast'red importunity.
    Fear it, Ophelia, fear 
it, my dear sister,
    And keep you in the rear of your affection,
    Out of the shot and danger
 of desire.
    The chariest maid is prodigal enough
    If she unmask her beauty to the moon.
  
  Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes.
    The canker galls the infants of the spring
    
Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd,
    And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
    Contagi
ous blastments are most imminent.
    Be wary then; best safety lies in fear.
    Youth to itself 
rebels, though none else near.
  Oph. I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep
    As watchman 
to my heart. But, good my brother,
    Do not as some ungracious pastors do,
    Show me the steep
 and thorny way to heaven,
    Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
    Himself the primr
ose path of dalliance treads
    And recks not his own rede.
  Laer. O, fear me not!

          
             Enter Polonius.

    I stay too long. But here my father comes.
    A double blessin
g is a double grace;
    Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
  Pol. Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, ab
oard, for shame!
    The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
    And you are stay'd for. There
- my blessing with thee!
    And these few precepts in thy memory
    Look thou character. Give th
y thoughts no tongue,
    Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.
    Be thou familiar, but by no 
means vulgar:
    Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
    Grapple them unto thy sou
l with hoops of steel;
    But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
    Of each new-hatch'd, un
fledg'd comrade. Beware
    Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,
    Bear't that th' opposed ma
y beware of thee.
    Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice;
    Take each man's censure, bu
t reserve thy judgment.
    Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
    But not express'd in fancy;
 rich, not gaudy;
    For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
    And they in France of the best ra
nk and station
    Are most select and generous, chief in that.
    Neither a borrower nor a lende
r be;
    For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
    And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry
.
    This above all- to thine own self be true,
    And it must follow, as the night the day,
  
  Thou canst not then be false to any man.
    Farewell. My blessing season this in thee!
  Laer. 
Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
  Pol. The time invites you. Go, your servants tend.
  La
er. Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well
    What I have said to you.
  Oph. 'Tis in my memory loc
k'd,
    And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
  Laer. Farewell.                             
             Exit.
  Pol. What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?
  Oph. So please you, something
 touching the Lord Hamlet.
  Pol. Marry, well bethought!
    'Tis told me he hath very oft of late

    Given private time to you, and you yourself
    Have of your audience been most free and boun
teous.
    If it be so- as so 'tis put on me,
    And that in way of caution- I must tell you
   
 You do not understand yourself so clearly
    As it behooves my daughter and your honour.
    Wha
t is between you? Give me up the truth.
  Oph. He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
    Of 
his affection to me.
  Pol. Affection? Pooh! You speak like a green girl,
    Unsifted in such per
ilous circumstance.
    Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
  Oph. I do not know, my lor
d, what I should think,
  Pol. Marry, I will teach you! Think yourself a baby
    That you have ta
'en these tenders for true pay,
    Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,
    Or (n
ot to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
    Running it thus) you'll tender me a fool.
  Oph. My l
ord, he hath importun'd me with love
    In honourable fashion.
  Pol. Ay, fashion you may call it
. Go to, go to!
  Oph. And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
    With almost all the 
holy vows of heaven.
  Pol. Ay, springes to catch woodcocks! I do know,
    When the blood burns, 
how prodigal the soul
    Lends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter,
    Giving more light tha
n heat, extinct in both
    Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
    You must not take for fi
re. From this time
    Be something scanter of your maiden presence.
    Set your entreatments at 
a higher rate
    Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
    Believe so much in him, that he i
s young,
    And with a larger tether may he walk
    Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia,
   
 Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
    Not of that dye which their investments show,

    But mere implorators of unholy suits,
    Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
    The b
etter to beguile. This is for all:
    I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth
    Have 
you so slander any moment leisure
    As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
    Look to't
, I charge you. Come your ways.
  Oph. I shall obey, my lord.
                                    
                     Exeunt.




Scene IV.
Elsinore. The platform before the Castle.

Enter 
Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus.

  Ham. The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
  Hor. It is a n
ipping and an eager air.
  Ham. What hour now?
  Hor. I think it lacks of twelve.
  Mar. No, it i
s struck.
  Hor. Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws near the season
    Wherein the spirit held
 his wont to walk.
                   A flourish of trumpets, and two pieces go off.
    What does
 this mean, my lord?
  Ham. The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
    Keeps wassail, an
d the swagg'ring upspring reels,
    And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
    The kettl
edrum and trumpet thus bray out
    The triumph of his pledge.
  Hor. Is it a custom?
  Ham. Ay, 
marry, is't;
    But to my mind, though I am native here
    And to the manner born, it is a custo
m
    More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
    This heavy-headed revel east and west

    Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations;
    They clip us drunkards and with swinish phras
e
    Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
    From our achievements, though perform'd at height
,
    The pith and marrow of our attribute.
    So oft it chances in particular men
    That, for
 some vicious mole of nature in them,
    As in their birth,- wherein they are not guilty,
    Sin
ce nature cannot choose his origin,-
    By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
    Oft breaking do
wn the pales and forts of reason,
    Or by some habit that too much o'erleavens
    The form of p
lausive manners, that these men
    Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
    Being nature's l
ivery, or fortune's star,
    Their virtues else- be they as pure as grace,
    As infinite as man
 may undergo-
    Shall in the general censure take corruption
    From that particular fault. The
 dram of e'il
    Doth all the noble substance often dout To his own scandal.

                  
       Enter Ghost.

  Hor. Look, my lord, it comes!
  Ham. Angels and ministers of grace defend 
us!
    Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
    Bring with thee airs from heaven or blast
s from hell,
    Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
    Thou com'st in such a questionable shape

    That I will speak to thee. I'll call thee Hamlet,
    King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me?

    Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell
    Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,
    H
ave burst their cerements; why the sepulchre
    Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
    Hath op'
d his ponderous and marble jaws
    To cast thee up again. What may this mean
    That thou, dead 
corse, again in complete steel,
    Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
    Making night hideo
us, and we fools of nature
    So horridly to shake our disposition
    With thoughts beyond the r
eaches of our souls?
    Say, why is this? wherefore? What should we do?
                         
                  Ghost beckons Hamlet.
  Hor. It beckons you to go away with it,
    As if it som
e impartment did desire
    To you alone.
  Mar. Look with what courteous action
    It waves you
 to a more removed ground.
    But do not go with it!
  Hor. No, by no means!
  Ham. It will not 
speak. Then will I follow it.
  Hor. Do not, my lord!
  Ham. Why, what should be the fear?
    I 
do not set my life at a pin's fee;
    And for my soul, what can it do to that,
    Being a thing 
immortal as itself?
    It waves me forth again. I'll follow it.
  Hor. What if it tempt you towar
d the flood, my lord,
    Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
    That beetles o'er his base in
to the sea,
    And there assume some other, horrible form
    Which might deprive your sovereignt
y of reason
    And draw you into madness? Think of it.
    The very place puts toys of desperatio
n,
    Without more motive, into every brain
    That looks so many fadoms to the sea
    And hea
rs it roar beneath.
  Ham. It waves me still.
    Go on. I'll follow thee.
  Mar. You shall not g
o, my lord.
  Ham. Hold off your hands!
  Hor. Be rul'd. You shall not go.
  Ham. My fate cries o
ut
    And makes each petty artire in this body
    As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
        
                                        [Ghost beckons.]

    Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentle
men.
    By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!-
    I say, away!- Go on. I'll follow t
hee.
                                        Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet.
  Hor. He waxes desperate wi
th imagination.
  Mar. Let's follow. 'Tis not fit thus to obey him.
  Hor. Have after. To what iss
ue will this come?
  Mar. Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
  Hor. Heaven will direct i
t.
  Mar. Nay, let's follow him.
                                                         Exeunt.





Scene V.
Elsinore. The Castle. Another part of the fortifications.

Enter Ghost and Haml
et.

  Ham. Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak! I'll go no further.
  Ghost. Mark me.
  Ham. I wil
l.
  Ghost. My hour is almost come,
    When I to sulph'rous and tormenting flames
    Must rende
r up myself.
  Ham. Alas, poor ghost!
  Ghost. Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
    To w
hat I shall unfold.
  Ham. Speak. I am bound to hear.
  Ghost. So art thou to revenge, when thou s
halt hear.
  Ham. What?
  Ghost. I am thy father's spirit,
    Doom'd for a certain term to walk 
the night,
    And for the day confin'd to fast in fires,
    Till the foul crimes done in my days
 of nature
    Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid
    To tell the secrets of my priso
n house,
    I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
    Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy yo
ung blood,
    Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
    Thy knotted and combin
ed locks to part,
    And each particular hair to stand on end
    Like quills upon the fretful po
rcupine.
    But this eternal blazon must not be
    To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, li
st!
    If thou didst ever thy dear father love-
  Ham. O God!
  Ghost. Revenge his foul and most
 unnatural murther.
  Ham. Murther?
  Ghost. Murther most foul, as in the best it is;
    But thi
s most foul, strange, and unnatural.
  Ham. Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
    As
 meditation or the thoughts of love,
    May sweep to my revenge.
  Ghost. I find thee apt;
    A
nd duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
    That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
    Woul
dst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.
    'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
   
 A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark
    Is by a forged process of my death
    Rankly
 abus'd. But know, thou noble youth,
    The serpent that did sting thy father's life
    Now wear
s his crown.
  Ham. O my prophetic soul!
    My uncle?
  Ghost. Ay, that incestuous, that adulter
ate beast,
    With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts-
    O wicked wit and gifts, that
 have the power
    So to seduce!- won to his shameful lust
    The will of my most seeming-virtuo
us queen.
    O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there,
    From me, whose love was of that dignity

    That it went hand in hand even with the vow
    I made to her in marriage, and to decline
   
 Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
    To those of mine!
    But virtue, as it never wil
l be mov'd,
    Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
    So lust, though to a radiant an
gel link'd,
    Will sate itself in a celestial bed
    And prey on garbage.
    But soft! methin
ks I scent the morning air.
    Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
    My custom always 
of the afternoon,
    Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
    With juice of cursed hebona in a vi
al,
    And in the porches of my ears did pour
    The leperous distilment; whose effect
    Hold
s such an enmity with blood of man
    That swift as quicksilver it courses through
    The natura
l gates and alleys of the body,
    And with a sudden vigour it doth posset
    And curd, like eag
er droppings into milk,
    The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine;
    And a most instant t
etter bark'd about,
    Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust
    All my smooth body.
  
  Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
    Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd;
 
   Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
    Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd,
    No reckonin
g made, but sent to my account
    With all my imperfections on my head.
  Ham. O, horrible! O, ho
rrible! most horrible!
  Ghost. If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.
    Let not the royal be
d of Denmark be
    A couch for luxury and damned incest.
    But, howsoever thou pursuest this ac
t,
    Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
    Against thy mother aught. Leave her to he
aven,
    And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge
    To prick and sting her. Fare thee well a
t once.
    The glowworm shows the matin to be near
    And gins to pale his uneffectual fire.
  
  Adieu, adieu, adieu! Remember me.                      Exit.

  Ham. O all you host of heaven! O
 earth! What else?
    And shall I couple hell? Hold, hold, my heart!
    And you, my sinews, grow
 not instant old,
    But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?
    Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory
 holds a seat
    In this distracted globe. Remember thee?
    Yea, from the table of my memory
 
   I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
    All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past
 
   That youth and observation copied there,
    And thy commandment all alone shall live
    Withi
n the book and volume of my brain,
    Unmix'd with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!
    O most perni
cious woman!
    O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
    My tables! Meet it is I set it d
own
    That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
    At least I am sure it may be so in De
nmark.        [Writes.]
    So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word:
    It is 'Adieu, adieu! Rem
ember me.'
    I have sworn't.
  Hor. (within) My lord, my lord!

                   Enter Horat
io and Marcellus.

  Mar. Lord Hamlet!
  Hor. Heaven secure him!
  Ham. So be it!
  Mar. Illo, 
ho, ho, my lord!
  Ham. Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.
  Mar. How is't, my noble lord?
  H
or. What news, my lord?
  Mar. O, wonderful!
  Hor. Good my lord, tell it.
  Ham. No, you will re
veal it.
  Hor. Not I, my lord, by heaven!
  Mar. Nor I, my lord.
  Ham. How say you then? Would 
heart of man once think it?
    But you'll be secret?
  Both. Ay, by heaven, my lord.
  Ham. Ther
e's neer a villain dwelling in all Denmark
    But he's an arrant knave.
  Hor. There needs no gho
st, my lord, come from the grave
    To tell us this.
  Ham. Why, right! You are in the right!
  
  And so, without more circumstance at all,
    I hold it fit that we shake hands and part;
    Yo
u, as your business and desires shall point you,
    For every man hath business and desire,
    S
uch as it is; and for my own poor part,
    Look you, I'll go pray.
  Hor. These are but wild and 
whirling words, my lord.
  Ham. I am sorry they offend you, heartily;
    Yes, faith, heartily.
 
 Hor. There's no offence, my lord.
  Ham. Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
    And mu
ch offence too. Touching this vision here,
    It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.
    Fo
r your desire to know what is between us,
    O'ermaster't as you may. And now, good friends,
    
As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,
    Give me one poor request.
  Hor. What is't, my lor
d? We will.
  Ham. Never make known what you have seen to-night.
  Both. My lord, we will not.
  
Ham. Nay, but swear't.
  Hor. In faith,
    My lord, not I.
  Mar. Nor I, my lord- in faith.
  H
am. Upon my sword.
  Mar. We have sworn, my lord, already.
  Ham. Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.


                 Ghost cries under the stage.

  Ghost. Swear.
  Ham. Aha boy, say'st thou so? 
Art thou there, truepenny?
    Come on! You hear this fellow in the cellarage.
    Consent to swea
r.
  Hor. Propose the oath, my lord.
  Ham. Never to speak of this that you have seen.
    Swear 
by my sword.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
  Ham. Hic et ubique? Then we'll shift our ground.
    Com
e hither, gentlemen,
    And lay your hands again upon my sword.
    Never to speak of this that y
ou have heard:
    Swear by my sword.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear by his sword.
  Ham. Well said, ol
d mole! Canst work i' th' earth so fast?
    A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends."
  H
or. O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
  Ham. And therefore as a stranger give it welco
me.
    There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
    Than are dreamt of in your philoso
phy.
    But come!
    Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
    How strange or odd soe'er I
 bear myself
    (As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
    To put an antic disposition on),

    That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
    With arms encumb'red thus, or this head-sha
ke,
    Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
    As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an 
if we would,'
    Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'
    Or such ambiguous
 giving out, to note
    That you know aught of me- this is not to do,
    So grace and mercy at y
our most need help you,
    Swear.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
                                    
               [They swear.]
  Ham. Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! So, gentlemen,
    With all my l
ove I do commend me to you;
    And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
    May do t' express his love
 and friending to you,
    God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;
    And still your 
fingers on your lips, I pray.
    The time is out of joint. O cursed spite
    That ever I was bor
n to set it right!
    Nay, come, let's go together.
                                             
            Exeunt.

Act II. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius
.

Enter Polonius and Reynaldo.

  Pol. Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
  Rey. I
 will, my lord.
  Pol. You shall do marvell's wisely, good Reynaldo,
    Before You visit him, to 
make inquire
    Of his behaviour.
  Rey. My lord, I did intend it.
  Pol. Marry, well said, very
 well said. Look you, sir,
    Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
    And how, and who, 
what means, and where they keep,
    What company, at what expense; and finding
    By this encomp
assment and drift of question
    That they do know my son, come you more nearer
    Than your par
ticular demands will touch it.
    Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
    As thus
, 'I know his father and his friends,
    And in part him.' Do you mark this, Reynaldo?
  Rey. Ay,
 very well, my lord.
  Pol. 'And in part him, but,' you may say, 'not well.
    But if't be he I m
ean, he's very wild
    Addicted so and so'; and there put on him
    What forgeries you please; m
arry, none so rank
    As may dishonour him- take heed of that;
    But, sir, such wanton, wild, a
nd usual slips
    As are companions noted and most known
    To youth and liberty.
  Rey. As gam
ing, my lord.
  Pol. Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
    Drabbing. You may go so 
far.
  Rey. My lord, that would dishonour him.
  Pol. Faith, no, as you may season it in the charg
e.
    You must not put another scandal on him,
    That he is open to incontinency.
    That's n
ot my meaning. But breathe his faults so quaintly
    That they may seem the taints of liberty,
  
  The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
    A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
    Of general as
sault.
  Rey. But, my good lord-
  Pol. Wherefore should you do this?
  Rey. Ay, my lord,
    I 
would know that.
  Pol. Marry, sir, here's my drift,
    And I believe it is a fetch of warrant.

    You laying these slight sullies on my son
    As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' th' working,

    Mark you,
    Your party in converse, him you would sound,
    Having ever seen in the preno
minate crimes
    The youth you breathe of guilty, be assur'd
    He closes with you in this conse
quence:
    'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman'-
    According to the phrase or the add
ition
    Of man and country-
  Rey. Very good, my lord.
  Pol. And then, sir, does 'a this- 'a d
oes- What was I about to
say?
    By the mass, I was about to say something! Where did I leave?
 
 Rey. At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,' and
    gentleman.'
  Pol. At 'closes in 
the consequence'- Ay, marry!
    He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman.
    I saw him yesterday, o
r t'other day,
    Or then, or then, with such or such; and, as you say,
    There was 'a gaming; 
there o'ertook in's rouse;
    There falling out at tennis'; or perchance,
    'I saw him enter su
ch a house of sale,'
    Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
    See you now-
    Your bait of fal
sehood takes this carp of truth;
    And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
    With windlasses an
d with assays of bias,
    By indirections find directions out.
    So, by my former lecture and a
dvice,
    Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?
  Rey. My lord, I have.
  Pol. God b' wi'
 ye, fare ye well!
  Rey. Good my lord!                                    [Going.]
  Pol. Observe
 his inclination in yourself.
  Rey. I shall, my lord.
  Pol. And let him ply his music.
  Rey. W
ell, my lord.
  Pol. Farewell!
                                                  Exit Reynaldo.


                       Enter Ophelia.

    How now, Ophelia? What's the matter?
  Oph. O my lord
, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
  Pol. With what, i' th' name of God?
  Oph. My lord, as I w
as sewing in my closet,
    Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac'd,
    No hat upon his head, 
his stockings foul'd,
    Ungart'red, and down-gyved to his ankle;
    Pale as his shirt, his knee
s knocking each other,
    And with a look so piteous in purport
    As if he had been loosed out 
of hell
    To speak of horrors- he comes before me.
  Pol. Mad for thy love?
  Oph. My lord, I d
o not know,
    But truly I do fear it.
  Pol. What said he?
  Oph. He took me by the wrist and h
eld me hard;
    Then goes he to the length of all his arm,
    And, with his other hand thus o'er
 his brow,
    He falls to such perusal of my face
    As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so.
  
  At last, a little shaking of mine arm,
    And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
    He r
ais'd a sigh so piteous and profound
    As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
    And end his be
ing. That done, he lets me go,
    And with his head over his shoulder turn'd
    He seem'd to fin
d his way without his eyes,
    For out o' doors he went without their help
    And to the last be
nded their light on me.
  Pol. Come, go with me. I will go seek the King.
    This is the very ecs
tasy of love,
    Whose violent property fordoes itself
    And leads the will to desperate undert
akings
    As oft as any passion under heaven
    That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
    
What, have you given him any hard words of late?
  Oph. No, my good lord; but, as you did command,

    I did repel his letters and denied
    His access to me.
  Pol. That hath made him mad.
    
I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
    I had not quoted him. I fear'd he did but trifle

    And meant to wrack thee; but beshrew my jealousy!
    By heaven, it is as proper to our age
 
   To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
    As it is common for the younger sort
    To lack d
iscretion. Come, go we to the King.
    This must be known; which, being kept close, might move
  
  More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
    Come.
                                          
               Exeunt.

Scene II.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Flourish. [Enter King and Qu
een, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern,
cum aliis.

  King. Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
.
    Moreover that we much did long to see you,
    The need we have to use you did provoke
    
Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
    Of Hamlet's transformation. So I call it,
    Sith
 nor th' exterior nor the inward man
    Resembles that it was. What it should be,
    More than h
is father's death, that thus hath put him
    So much from th' understanding of himself,
    I can
not dream of. I entreat you both
    That, being of so young days brought up with him,
    And sin
ce so neighbour'd to his youth and haviour,
    That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
   
 Some little time; so by your companies
    To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather
    So much
 as from occasion you may glean,
    Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus
    That, open'
d, lies within our remedy.
  Queen. Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,
    And sure I am 
two men there are not living
    To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
    To show us so 
much gentry and good will
    As to expend your time with us awhile
    For the supply and profit 
of our hope,
    Your visitation shall receive such thanks
    As fits a king's remembrance.
  Ro
s. Both your Majesties
    Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
    Put your dread pleasu
res more into command
    Than to entreaty.
  Guil. But we both obey,
    And here give up oursel
ves, in the full bent,
    To lay our service freely at your feet,
    To be commanded.
  King. T
hanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
  Queen. Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz.

    And I beseech you instantly to visit
    My too much changed son.- Go, some of you,
    And br
ing these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
  Guil. Heavens make our presence and our practices
    Pleas
ant and helpful to him!
  Queen. Ay, amen!
                 Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, [
with some
                                                    Attendants].

                     
    Enter Polonius.

  Pol. Th' ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
    Are joyfully return'd.

  King. Thou still hast been the father of good news.
  Pol. Have I, my lord? Assure you, my good
 liege,
    I hold my duty as I hold my soul,
    Both to my God and to my gracious king;
    And
 I do think- or else this brain of mine
    Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
    As it hath u
s'd to do- that I have found
    The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
  King. O, speak of that! That
 do I long to hear.
  Pol. Give first admittance to th' ambassadors.
    My news shall be the frui
t to that great feast.
  King. Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
                      
                          [Exit Polonius.]
    He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found
    Th
e head and source of all your son's distemper.
  Queen. I doubt it is no other but the main,
    H
is father's death and our o'erhasty marriage.
  King. Well, we shall sift him.

              Ent
er Polonius, Voltemand, and Cornelius.

    Welcome, my good friends.
    Say, Voltemand, what fr
om our brother Norway?
  Volt. Most fair return of greetings and desires.
    Upon our first, he s
ent out to suppress
    His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
    To be a preparation 'gainst
 the Polack,
    But better look'd into, he truly found
    It was against your Highness; whereat 
griev'd,
    That so his sickness, age, and impotence
    Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arr
ests
    On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys,
    Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,

    Makes vow before his uncle never more
    To give th' assay of arms against your Majesty.
   
 Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
    Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee
    And 
his commission to employ those soldiers,
    So levied as before, against the Polack;
    With an 
entreaty, herein further shown,
                                                [Gives a paper.]
 
   That it might please you to give quiet pass
    Through your dominions for this enterprise,
   
 On such regards of safety and allowance
    As therein are set down.
  King. It likes us well;
 
   And at our more consider'd time we'll read,
    Answer, and think upon this business.
    Meant
ime we thank you for your well-took labour.
    Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together.
  
  Most welcome home!                       Exeunt Ambassadors.
  Pol. This business is well ended.

    My liege, and madam, to expostulate
    What majesty should be, what duty is,
    Why day is 
day, night is night, and time is time.
    Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time.
    The
refore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
    And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
  
  I will be brief. Your noble son is mad.
    Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,
    What
 is't but to be nothing else but mad?
    But let that go.
  Queen. More matter, with less art.
 
 Pol. Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
    That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
    
And pity 'tis 'tis true. A foolish figure!
    But farewell it, for I will use no art.
    Mad let
 us grant him then. And now remains
    That we find out the cause of this effect-
    Or rather s
ay, the cause of this defect,
    For this effect defective comes by cause.
    Thus it remains, a
nd the remainder thus.
    Perpend.
    I have a daughter (have while she is mine),
    Who in he
r duty and obedience, mark,
    Hath given me this. Now gather, and surmise.
                     
                        [Reads] the letter.
    'To the celestial, and my soul's idol, the most bea
utified
      Ophelia,'-

    That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is a vile
      
phrase.
    But you shall hear. Thus:
                                                        [Rea
ds.]
    'In her excellent white bosom, these, &c.'
  Queen. Came this from Hamlet to her?
  Pol.
 Good madam, stay awhile. I will be faithful.     [Reads.]


          'Doubt thou the stars are 
fire;
            Doubt that the sun doth move;
          Doubt truth to be a liar;
            B
ut never doubt I love.
      'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers; I have not art
to
    re
ckon my groans; but that I love thee best, O most best,
believe
    it. Adieu.
      'Thine everm
ore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to
him,

HAMLET.'

    This, in obedience, hath my 
daughter shown me;
    And more above, hath his solicitings,
    As they fell out by time, by mean
s, and place,
    All given to mine ear.
  King. But how hath she
    Receiv'd his love?
  Pol. 
What do you think of me?
  King. As of a man faithful and honourable.
  Pol. I would fain prove so
. But what might you think,
    When I had seen this hot love on the wing
    (As I perceiv'd it, 
I must tell you that,
    Before my daughter told me), what might you,
    Or my dear Majesty your
 queen here, think,
    If I had play'd the desk or table book,
    Or given my heart a winking, m
ute and dumb,
    Or look'd upon this love with idle sight?
    What might you think? No, I went r
ound to work
    And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
    'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of th
y star.
    This must not be.' And then I prescripts gave her,
    That she should lock herself fr
om his resort,
    Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
    Which done, she took the fruits of 
my advice,
    And he, repulsed, a short tale to make,
    Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,

    Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
    Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,

    Into the madness wherein now he raves,
    And all we mourn for.
  King. Do you think 'tis t
his?
  Queen. it may be, very like.
  Pol. Hath there been such a time- I would fain know that-
 
   That I have Positively said ''Tis so,'
    When it prov'd otherwise.?
  King. Not that I know.

  Pol. [points to his head and shoulder] Take this from this, if
this
      be otherwise.
    If
 circumstances lead me, I will find
    Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
    Within t
he centre.
  King. How may we try it further?
  Pol. You know sometimes he walks for hours togethe
r
    Here in the lobby.
  Queen. So he does indeed.
  Pol. At such a time I'll loose my daughter
 to him.
    Be you and I behind an arras then.
    Mark the encounter. If he love her not,
    A
nd he not from his reason fall'n thereon
    Let me be no assistant for a state,
    But keep a fa
rm and carters.
  King. We will try it.

                 Enter Hamlet, reading on a book.

  Q
ueen. But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
  Pol. Away, I do beseech you, both away

    I'll board him presently. O, give me leave.
                       Exeunt King and Queen, [wit
h Attendants].
    How does my good Lord Hamlet?
  Ham. Well, God-a-mercy.
  Pol. Do you know me,
 my lord?
  Ham. Excellent well. You are a fishmonger.
  Pol. Not I, my lord.
  Ham. Then I would
 you were so honest a man.
  Pol. Honest, my lord?
  Ham. Ay, sir. To be honest, as this world goe
s, is to be one
man
    pick'd out of ten thousand.
  Pol. That's very true, my lord.
  Ham. For
 if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god
    kissing carrion- Have you a daughter?
  P
ol. I have, my lord.
  Ham. Let her not walk i' th' sun. Conception is a blessing, but
not
    as
 your daughter may conceive. Friend, look to't.
  Pol. [aside] How say you by that? Still harping o
n my daughter.
Yet
    he knew me not at first. He said I was a fishmonger. He is
far
    gone, 
far gone! And truly in my youth I suff'red much
extremity
    for love- very near this. I'll speak
 to him again.- What do
you
    read, my lord?
  Ham. Words, words, words.
  Pol. What is the ma
tter, my lord?
  Ham. Between who?
  Pol. I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
  Ham. Sland
ers, sir; for the satirical rogue says here that old
men
    have grey beards; that their faces ar
e wrinkled; their eyes
    purging thick amber and plum-tree gum; and that they have a
    plentif
ul lack of wit, together with most weak hams. All
which,
    sir, though I most powerfully and pot
ently believe, yet I
hold it
    not honesty to have it thus set down; for you yourself, sir,
   
 should be old as I am if, like a crab, you could go backward.

  Pol. [aside] Though this be madn
ess, yet there is a method
in't.-
   Will You walk out of the air, my lord?
  Ham. Into my grave?

  Pol. Indeed, that is out o' th' air. [Aside] How pregnant
sometimes
    his replies are! a hap
piness that often madness hits on,
which
    reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delive
red of.
I
    will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting
between
    him and my d
aughter.- My honourable lord, I will most humbly
take
    my leave of you.
  Ham. You cannot, sir
, take from me anything that I will more
    willingly part withal- except my life, except my life,
 except
my
    life,

                    Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Pol. Fare you
 well, my lord.
  Ham. These tedious old fools!
  Pol. You go to seek the Lord Hamlet. There he is
.
  Ros. [to Polonius] God save you, sir!
                                                Exit [Po
lonius].

  Guil. My honour'd lord!
  Ros. My most dear lord!
  Ham. My excellent good friends! 
How dost thou, Guildenstern?
Ah,
    Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
  Ros. As the indiff
erent children of the earth.
  Guil. Happy in that we are not over-happy.
    On Fortune's cap we 
are not the very button.
  Ham. Nor the soles of her shoe?
  Ros. Neither, my lord.
  Ham. Then y
ou live about her waist, or in the middle of her
    favours?
  Guil. Faith, her privates we.
  H
am. In the secret parts of Fortune? O! most true! she is a
    strumpet. What news ?
  Ros. None, 
my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
  Ham. Then is doomsday near! But your news is not true
. Let me
    question more in particular. What have you, my good friends,
    deserved at the hand
s of Fortune that she sends you to prison
    hither?
  Guil. Prison, my lord?
  Ham. Denmark's a
 prison.
  Ros. Then is the world one.
  Ham. A goodly one; in which there are many confines, ward
s, and
    dungeons, Denmark being one o' th' worst.
  Ros. We think not so, my lord.
  Ham. Why,
 then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either
good
    or bad but thinking makes it so. To m
e it is a prison.
  Ros. Why, then your ambition makes it one. 'Tis too narrow for
your
    mind.

  Ham. O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a
    king of infinite space, wer
e it not that I have bad dreams.
  Guil. Which dreams indeed are ambition; for the very substance

of
    the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
  Ham. A dream itself is but a shadow.
  Ro
s. Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality
that
    it is but a shadow's shadow.

  Ham. Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and
outstretch'd
    heroes the beggars' sh
adows. Shall we to th' court? for, by
my
    fay, I cannot reason.
  Both. We'll wait upon you.

  Ham. No such matter! I will not sort you with the rest of my
    servants; for, to speak to you l
ike an honest man, I am most
    dreadfully attended. But in the beaten way of friendship,
what
 
   make you at Elsinore?
  Ros. To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
  Ham. Beggar that I am,
 I am even poor in thanks; but I thank
you;
    and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a h
alfpenny.
Were
    you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free
    visitation? Come,
 deal justly with me. Come, come! Nay,
speak.
  Guil. What should we say, my lord?
  Ham. Why, an
ything- but to th' purpose. You were sent for; and
    there is a kind of confession in your looks,
 which your
modesties
    have not craft enough to colour. I know the good King and
Queen
    ha
ve sent for you.
  Ros. To what end, my lord?
  Ham. That you must teach me. But let me conjure yo
u by the
rights
    of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the
    obligation of o
ur ever-preserved love, and by what more dear
a
    better proposer could charge you withal, be ev
en and direct
with
    me, whether you were sent for or no.
  Ros. [aside to Guildenstern] What s
ay you?
  Ham. [aside] Nay then, I have an eye of you.- If you love me,
hold
    not off.
  Guil
. My lord, we were sent for.
  Ham. I will tell you why. So shall my anticipation prevent your
   
 discovery, and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no
    feather. I have of late- but wheref
ore I know not- lost all
my
    mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes
so
 
   heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the
earth,
    seems to me a sterile promon
tory; this most excellent canopy,
the
    air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this
m
ajestical
    roof fretted with golden fire- why, it appeareth no other
thing
    to me than a fo
ul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What
a
    piece of work is a man! how noble in reason! 
how infinite in
    faculties! in form and moving how express and admirable! in
    action how lik
e an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the
    beauty of the world, the paragon of animals! An
d yet to me
what
    is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me- no, nor
woman
    neithe
r, though by your smiling you seem to say so.
  Ros. My lord, there was no such stuff in my thought
s.
  Ham. Why did you laugh then, when I said 'Man delights not me'?
  Ros. To think, my lord, if 
you delight not in man, what lenten
    entertainment the players shall receive from you. We coted

them
    on the way, and hither are they coming to offer you service.
  Ham. He that plays the ki
ng shall be welcome- his Majesty shall
    have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his
 foil
and
    target; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humorous man
shall
    end his part i
n peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose
    lungs are tickle o' th' sere; and the lady shal
l say her mind
    freely, or the blank verse shall halt for't. What players are
    they?
  Ros.
 Even those you were wont to take such delight in, the
    tragedians of the city.
  Ham. How chan
ces it they travel? Their residence, both in
    reputation and profit, was better both ways.
  Ro
s. I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late
    innovation.
  Ham. Do they hold the
 same estimation they did when I was in
the
    city? Are they so follow'd?
  Ros. No indeed are 
they not.
  Ham. How comes it? Do they grow rusty?
  Ros. Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted
 pace; but there
is,
    sir, an eyrie of children, little eyases, that cry out on the
top
    o
f question and are most tyrannically clapp'd for't. These
are now
    the fashion, and so berattle
 the common stages (so they call
    them) that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goosequills and

    dare scarce come thither.
  Ham. What, are they children? Who maintains 'em? How are they
   
 escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can
    sing? Will they not say afterwar
ds, if they should grow
    themselves to common players (as it is most like, if their
means
    
are no better), their writers do them wrong to make them
exclaim
    against their own succession.

  Ros. Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the
nation
    holds it no sin to tar
re them to controversy. There was, for
a
    while, no money bid for argument unless the poet and 
the
player
    went to cuffs in the question.
  Ham. Is't possible?
  Guil. O, there has been mu
ch throwing about of brains.
  Ham. Do the boys carry it away?
  Ros. Ay, that they do, my lord- H
ercules and his load too.
  Ham. It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark,
and
   
 those that would make mows at him while my father lived give
    twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred d
ucats apiece for his picture
in
    little. 'Sblood, there is something in this more than
natural
, if
    philosophy could find it out.

                     Flourish for the Players.

  Guil.
 There are the players.
  Ham. Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come!
Th'
    
appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me
comply
    with you in this garb, lest my 
extent to the players (which I
    tell you must show fairly outwards) should more appear like
   
 entertainment than yours. You are welcome. But my
uncle-father
    and aunt-mother are deceiv'd.

  Guil. In what, my dear lord?
  Ham. I am but mad north-north-west. When the wind is southerly
I

    know a hawk from a handsaw.

                            Enter Polonius.

  Pol. Well be w
ith you, gentlemen!
  Ham. Hark you, Guildenstern- and you too- at each ear a hearer!
    That gre
at baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling
    clouts.
  Ros. Happily he's the second t
ime come to them; for they say an
old
    man is twice a child.
  Ham. I will prophesy he comes t
o tell me of the players. Mark
it.-
   You say right, sir; a Monday morning; twas so indeed.
  Po
l. My lord, I have news to tell you.
  Ham. My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an

actor in
    Rome-
  Pol. The actors are come hither, my lord.
  Ham. Buzz, buzz!
  Pol. Upon my
 honour-
  Ham. Then came each actor on his ass-
  Pol. The best actors in the world, either for t
ragedy, comedy,
    history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral,
    tragical-histori
cal, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral;
scene
    individable, or poem unlimited. Seneca cannot
 be too heavy,
nor
    Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these
are
    the
 only men.
  Ham. O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
  Pol. What treasure ha
d he, my lord?
  Ham. Why,

         'One fair daughter, and no more,
           The which he lo
ved passing well.'

  Pol. [aside] Still on my daughter.
  Ham. Am I not i' th' right, old Jephth
ah?
  Pol. If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I
    love passing well.
  Ha
m. Nay, that follows not.
  Pol. What follows then, my lord?
  Ham. Why,

           'As by lot,
 God wot,'

 and then, you know,

           'It came to pass, as most like it was.'

    The 
first row of the pious chanson will show you more; for
look
    where my abridgment comes.

    
                 Enter four or five Players.

    You are welcome, masters; welcome, all.- I am gl
ad to see
thee
    well.- Welcome, good friends.- O, my old friend? Why, thy
face is
    valanc'
d since I saw thee last. Com'st' thou to' beard me in
    Denmark?- What, my young lady and mistres
s? By'r Lady, your
    ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last by the
    altitude o
f a chopine. Pray God your voice, like a piece of
    uncurrent gold, be not crack'd within the rin
g.- Masters, you
are
    all welcome. We'll e'en to't like French falconers, fly at
    anything 
we see. We'll have a speech straight. Come, give us
a
    taste of your quality. Come, a passionat
e speech.
  1. Play. What speech, my good lord?
  Ham. I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it
 was never
acted;
    or if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember,
pleas'd
    not th
e million, 'twas caviary to the general; but it was (as
I
    receiv'd it, and others, whose judgm
ents in such matters
cried in
    the top of mine) an excellent play, well digested in the
scenes
,
    set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember one said
    there were no sallets in t
he lines to make the matter
savoury,
    nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author 
of
    affectation; but call'd it an honest method, as wholesome as
    sweet, and by very much mo
re handsome than fine. One speech
in't
    I chiefly lov'd. 'Twas AEneas' tale to Dido, and therea
bout
of it
    especially where he speaks of Priam's slaughter. If it live
in
    your memory, b
egin at this line- let me see, let me see:

         'The rugged Pyrrhus, like th' Hyrcanian beast
-'

    'Tis not so; it begins with Pyrrhus:

         'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,

         Black as his purpose, did the night resemble
         When he lay couched in the ominous
 horse,
         Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd
         With heraldry more dism
al. Head to foot
         Now is be total gules, horridly trick'd
         With blood of fathers, 
mothers, daughters, sons,
         Bak'd and impasted with the parching streets,
         That len
d a tyrannous and a damned light
         To their lord's murther. Roasted in wrath and fire,
    
     And thus o'ersized with coagulate gore,
         With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhu
s
         Old grandsire Priam seeks.'

    So, proceed you.
  Pol. Fore God, my lord, well spok
en, with good accent and good
     discretion.

  1. Play. 'Anon he finds him,
      Striking to
o short at Greeks. His antique sword,
      Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
      Repu
gnant to command. Unequal match'd,
      Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide;
      But 
with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
      Th' unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
 
     Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
      Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash

      Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear. For lo! his sword,
      Which was declining on the milky head

      Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' th' air to stick.
      So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood
,
      And, like a neutral to his will and matter,
      Did nothing.
      But, as we often see
, against some storm,
      A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
      The bold winds s
peechless, and the orb below
      As hush as death- anon the dreadful thunder
      Doth rend the
 region; so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
      Aroused vengeance sets him new awork;
      And never did
 the Cyclops' hammers fall
      On Mars's armour, forg'd for proof eterne,
      With less remors
e than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
      Now falls on Priam.
      Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune! Al
l you gods,
      In general synod take away her power;
      Break all the spokes and fellies fro
m her wheel,
      And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
      As low as to the fiends!


  Pol. This is too long.
  Ham. It shall to the barber's, with your beard.- Prithee say
on.
 
   He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps. Say on;
come to
    Hecuba.

  1. Play. 'Bu
t who, O who, had seen the mobled queen-'

  Ham. 'The mobled queen'?
  Pol. That's good! 'Mobled
 queen' is good.

  1. Play. 'Run barefoot up and down, threat'ning the flames
      With bisson 
rheum; a clout upon that head
      Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
      About her l
ank and all o'erteemed loins,
      A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up-
      Who this had 
seen, with tongue in venom steep'd
      'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have pronounc'd.
  
    But if the gods themselves did see her then,
      When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
 
     In Mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,
      The instant burst of clamour that she mad
e
      (Unless things mortal move them not at all)
      Would have made milch the burning eyes o
f heaven
      And passion in the gods.'

  Pol. Look, whe'r he has not turn'd his colour, and ha
s tears
in's
    eyes. Prithee no more!
  Ham. 'Tis well. I'll have thee speak out the rest of th
is
soon.-
    Good my lord, will you see the players well bestow'd? Do you
    hear? Let them be 
well us'd; for they are the abstract and
brief
    chronicles of the time. After your death you we
re better have
a
    bad epitaph than their ill report while you live.
  Pol. My lord, I will use
 them according to their desert.
  Ham. God's bodykins, man, much better! Use every man after his

    desert, and who should scape whipping? Use them after your
own
    honour and dignity. The les
s they deserve, the more merit is
in
    your bounty. Take them in.
  Pol. Come, sirs.
  Ham. Fo
llow him, friends. We'll hear a play to-morrow.
                 Exeunt Polonius and Players [excep
t the First].
    Dost thou hear me, old friend? Can you play 'The Murther of
    Gonzago'?
  1. 
Play. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need, study a
    speech of
 some dozen or sixteen lines which I would set down
and
    insert in't, could you not?
  1. Play
. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Very well. Follow that lord- and look you mock him not.
                    
                        [Exit First Player.]
    My good friends, I'll leave you till night. You ar
e welcome
to
    Elsinore.
  Ros. Good my lord!
  Ham. Ay, so, God b' wi' ye!
                 
           [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
    Now I am alone.
    O what a rogue and peasant
 slave am I!
    Is it not monstrous that this player here,
    But in a fiction, in a dream of pa
ssion,
    Could force his soul so to his own conceit
    That, from her working, all his visage w
ann'd,
    Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
    A broken voice, and his whole function 
suiting
    With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!
    For Hecuba!
    What's Hecuba to 
him, or he to Hecuba,
    That he should weep for her? What would he do,
    Had he the motive and
 the cue for passion
    That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
    And cleave the gener
al ear with horrid speech;
    Make mad the guilty and appal the free,
    Confound the ignorant, 
and amaze indeed
    The very faculties of eyes and ears.
    Yet I,
    A dull and muddy-mettled
 rascal, peak
    Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
    And can say nothing! No, not for
 a king,
    Upon whose property and most dear life
    A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?

    Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
    Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?

    Tweaks me by th' nose? gives me the lie i' th' throat
    As deep as to the lungs? Who does me 
this, ha?
    'Swounds, I should take it! for it cannot be
    But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack ga
ll
    To make oppression bitter, or ere this
    I should have fatted all the region kites
    W
ith this slave's offal. Bloody bawdy villain!
    Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless vil
lain!
    O, vengeance!
    Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
    That I, the son of a d
ear father murther'd,
    Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
    Must (like a whore) unpac
k my heart with words
    And fall a-cursing like a very drab,
    A scullion!
    Fie upon't! fo
h! About, my brain! Hum, I have heard
    That guilty creatures, sitting at a play,
    Have by th
e very cunning of the scene
    Been struck so to the soul that presently
    They have proclaim'd
 their malefactions;
    For murther, though it have no tongue, will speak
    With most miraculou
s organ, I'll have these Players
    Play something like the murther of my father
    Before mine 
uncle. I'll observe his looks;
    I'll tent him to the quick. If he but blench,
    I know my cou
rse. The spirit that I have seen
    May be a devil; and the devil hath power
    T' assume a plea
sing shape; yea, and perhaps
    Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
    As he is very potent wi
th such spirits,
    Abuses me to damn me. I'll have grounds
    More relative than this. The play
's the thing
    Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King.         Exit.

ACT III. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencra
ntz, Guildenstern,
and Lords.

  King. And can you by no drift of circumstance
    Get from him 
why he puts on this confusion,
    Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
    With turbulent and
 dangerous lunacy?
  Ros. He does confess he feels himself distracted,
    But from what cause he 
will by no means speak.
  Guil. Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
    But with a crafty ma
dness keeps aloof
    When we would bring him on to some confession
    Of his true state.
  Quee
n. Did he receive you well?
  Ros. Most like a gentleman.
  Guil. But with much forcing of his dis
position.
  Ros. Niggard of question, but of our demands
    Most free in his reply.
  Queen. Did
 you assay him
    To any pastime?
  Ros. Madam, it so fell out that certain players
    We o'err
aught on the way. Of these we told him,
    And there did seem in him a kind of joy
    To hear of
 it. They are here about the court,
    And, as I think, they have already order
    This night to
 play before him.
  Pol. 'Tis most true;
    And he beseech'd me to entreat your Majesties
    To
 hear and see the matter.
  King. With all my heart, and it doth much content me
    To hear him s
o inclin'd.
    Good gentlemen, give him a further edge
    And drive his purpose on to these deli
ghts.
  Ros. We shall, my lord.
                            Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  King. Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
    For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
    That he,
 as 'twere by accident, may here
    Affront Ophelia.
    Her father and myself (lawful espials)

    Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing unseen,
    We may of their encounter frankly judge
    
And gather by him, as he is behav'd,
    If't be th' affliction of his love, or no,
    That thus 
he suffers for.
  Queen. I shall obey you;
    And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
    That you
r good beauties be the happy cause
    Of Hamlet's wildness. So shall I hope your virtues
    Will
 bring him to his wonted way again,
    To both your honours.
  Oph. Madam, I wish it may.
      
                                             [Exit Queen.]
  Pol. Ophelia, walk you here.- Gracious
, so please you,
    We will bestow ourselves.- [To Ophelia] Read on this book,
    That show of s
uch an exercise may colour
    Your loneliness.- We are oft to blame in this,
    'Tis too much pr
ov'd, that with devotion's visage
    And pious action we do sugar o'er
    The Devil himself.
  
King. [aside] O, 'tis too true!
    How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
    The 
harlot's cheek, beautied with plast'ring art,
    Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
    
Than is my deed to my most painted word.
    O heavy burthen!
  Pol. I hear him coming. Let's with
draw, my lord.
                                      Exeunt King and Polonius].

                
           Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. To be, or not to be- that is the question:
    Whether 'tis nobl
er in the mind to suffer
    The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
    Or to take arms again
st a sea of troubles,
    And by opposing end them. To die- to sleep-
    No more; and by a sleep 
to say we end
    The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks
    That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a
 consummation
    Devoutly to be wish'd. To die- to sleep.
    To sleep- perchance to dream: ay, t
here's the rub!
    For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
    When we have shuffled off 
this mortal coil,
    Must give us pause. There's the respect
    That makes calamity of so long l
ife.
    For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
    Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man
's contumely,
    The pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay,
    The insolence of office, and th
e spurns
    That patient merit of th' unworthy takes,
    When he himself might his quietus make

    With a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear,
    To grunt and sweat under a weary life,

    But that the dread of something after death-
    The undiscover'd country, from whose bourn
  
  No traveller returns- puzzles the will,
    And makes us rather bear those ills we have
    Than
 fly to others that we know not of?
    Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
    And thus 
the native hue of resolution
    Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
    And enterpris
es of great pith and moment
    With this regard their currents turn awry
    And lose the name of
 action.- Soft you now!
    The fair Ophelia!- Nymph, in thy orisons
    Be all my sins rememb'red
.
  Oph. Good my lord,
    How does your honour for this many a day?
  Ham. I humbly thank you; w
ell, well, well.
  Oph. My lord, I have remembrances of yours
    That I have longed long to re-de
liver.
    I pray you, now receive them.
  Ham. No, not I!
    I never gave you aught.
  Oph. My
 honour'd lord, you know right well you did,
    And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd
 
   As made the things more rich. Their perfume lost,
    Take these again; for to the noble mind
 
   Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
    There, my lord.
  Ham. Ha, ha! Are you honest
?
  Oph. My lord?
  Ham. Are you fair?
  Oph. What means your lordship?
  Ham. That if you be ho
nest and fair, your honesty should admit
no
    discourse to your beauty.
  Oph. Could beauty, my
 lord, have better commerce than with
honesty?
  Ham. Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will soon
er transform
    honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty
can
    translate be
auty into his likeness. This was sometime a
paradox,
    but now the time gives it proof. I did lo
ve you once.
  Oph. Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
  Ham. You should not have believ'd m
e; for virtue cannot so
    inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it. I loved
you
    no
t.
  Oph. I was the more deceived.
  Ham. Get thee to a nunnery! Why wouldst thou be a breeder of

    sinners? I am myself indifferent honest, but yet I could
accuse
    me of such things that it
 were better my mother had not borne
me.
    I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more off
ences at
my
    beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give
    them shape, or 
time to act them in. What should such fellows
as I
    do, crawling between earth and heaven? We a
re arrant knaves
all;
    believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where's your
    father?

  Oph. At home, my lord.
  Ham. Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool
    now
here but in's own house. Farewell.
  Oph. O, help him, you sweet heavens!
  Ham. If thou dost marr
y, I'll give thee this plague for thy
dowry:
    be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou s
halt not
escape
    calumny. Get thee to a nunnery. Go, farewell. Or if thou wilt
    needs marry
, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what
    monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go;
 and quickly too.
    Farewell.
  Oph. O heavenly powers, restore him!
  Ham. I have heard of you
r paintings too, well enough. God hath
    given you one face, and you make yourselves another. You
 jig,
you
    amble, and you lisp; you nickname God's creatures and make
your
    wantonness you
r ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't! it hath
made
    me mad. I say, we will have no more marria
ges. Those that are
    married already- all but one- shall live; the rest shall keep
as
    they
 are. To a nunnery, go.                            Exit.
  Oph. O, what a noble mind is here o'erth
rown!
    The courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword,
    Th' expectancy and rose of
 the fair state,
    The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
    Th' observ'd of all observers
- quite, quite down!
    And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
    That suck'd the honey of h
is music vows,
    Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
    Like sweet bells jangled, out
 of tune and harsh;
    That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
    Blasted with ecstasy. O
, woe is me
    T' have seen what I have seen, see what I see!

                   Enter King and
 Polonius.

  King. Love? his affections do not that way tend;
    Nor what he spake, though it l
ack'd form a little,
    Was not like madness. There's something in his soul
    O'er which his me
lancholy sits on brood;
    And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
    Will be some danger; whi
ch for to prevent,
    I have in quick determination
    Thus set it down: he shall with speed to 
England
    For the demand of our neglected tribute.
    Haply the seas, and countries different,

    With variable objects, shall expel
    This something-settled matter in his heart,
    Whereo
n his brains still beating puts him thus
    From fashion of himself. What think you on't?
  Pol. 
It shall do well. But yet do I believe
    The origin and commencement of his grief
    Sprung fro
m neglected love.- How now, Ophelia?
    You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said.
    We heard 
it all.- My lord, do as you please;
    But if you hold it fit, after the play
    Let his queen m
other all alone entreat him
    To show his grief. Let her be round with him;
    And I'll be plac
'd so please you, in the ear
    Of all their conference. If she find him not,
    To England send
 him; or confine him where
    Your wisdom best shall think.
  King. It shall be so.
    Madness 
in great ones must not unwatch'd go.         Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. hall in the Castl
e.

Enter Hamlet and three of the Players.

  Ham. Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounc'd
 it to you,
    trippingly on the tongue. But if you mouth it, as many of our
    players do, I ha
d as live the town crier spoke my lines. Nor
do
    not saw the air too much with your hand, thus,
 but use all
    gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and (as I may say)
    whirlwind of you
r passion, you must acquire and beget a
    temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends m
e to
the
    soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion
to
    tatters, to ve
ry rags, to split the cars of the groundlings,
who
    (for the most part) are capable of nothing 
but inexplicable
dumb
    shows and noise. I would have such a fellow whipp'd for
o'erdoing
    
Termagant. It out-herods Herod. Pray you avoid it.
  Player. I warrant your honour.
  Ham. Be not 
too tame neither; but let your own discretion be
your
    tutor. Suit the action to the word, the 
word to the action;
with
    this special observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of
    na
ture: for anything so overdone is from the purpose of
playing,
    whose end, both at the first an
d now, was and is, to hold, as
    'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show Virtue her own
feature
,
    scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time
his
    form and pressure. Now t
his overdone, or come tardy off,
though
    it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judic
ious
    grieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance
    o'erweigh a whole theatre
 of others. O, there be players that
I
    have seen play, and heard others praise, and that highl
y (not
to
    speak it profanely), that, neither having the accent of
    Christians, nor the gai
t of Christian, pagan, nor man, have
so
    strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of Natu
re's
    journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they
imitated
    humanity so abominabl
y.
  Player. I hope we have reform'd that indifferently with us,
sir.
  Ham. O, reform it altoget
her! And let those that play your
clowns
    speak no more than is set down for them. For there be
 of them
    that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren
    spectators to laugh
 too, though in the mean time some
necessary
    question of the play be then to be considered. Th
at's
villanous
    and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it.
Go
    make you r
eady.
                                                 Exeunt Players.

            Enter Poloniu
s, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.

    How now, my lord? Will the King hear this piece of work?
 
 Pol. And the Queen too, and that presently.
  Ham. Bid the players make haste, [Exit Polonius.] Wi
ll you two
    help to hasten them?
  Both. We will, my lord.                       Exeunt they tw
o.
  Ham. What, ho, Horatio!

                      Enter Horatio.

  Hor. Here, sweet lord, at
 your service.
  Ham. Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
    As e'er my conversation cop'd witha
l.
  Hor. O, my dear lord!
  Ham. Nay, do not think I flatter;
    For what advancement may I hop
e from thee,
    That no revenue hast but thy good spirits
    To feed and clothe thee? Why should
 the poor be flatter'd?
    No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
    And crook the pregnan
t hinges of the knee
    Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
    Since my dear soul w
as mistress of her choice
    And could of men distinguish, her election
    Hath seal'd thee for 
herself. For thou hast been
    As one, in suff'ring all, that suffers nothing;
    A man that For
tune's buffets and rewards
    Hast ta'en with equal thanks; and blest are those
    Whose blood a
nd judgment are so well commingled
    That they are not a pipe for Fortune's finger
    To sound 
what stop she please. Give me that man
    That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
    In
 my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
    As I do thee. Something too much of this I
    The
re is a play to-night before the King.
    One scene of it comes near the circumstance,
    Which 
I have told thee, of my father's death.
    I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
    Even wi
th the very comment of thy soul
    Observe my uncle. If his occulted guilt
    Do not itself unke
nnel in one speech,
    It is a damned ghost that we have seen,
    And my imaginations are as fou
l
    As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
    For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,
    
And after we will both our judgments join
    In censure of his seeming.
  Hor. Well, my lord.
  
  If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
    And scape detecting, I will pay the theft.


    Sound a flourish. [Enter Trumpets and Kettledrums. Danish
    march. [Enter King, Queen, Po
lonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz,
      Guildenstern, and other Lords attendant, with the Guard
      
                 carrying torches.

  Ham. They are coming to the play. I must be idle.
    Get y
ou a place.
  King. How fares our cousin Hamlet?
  Ham. Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's di
sh. I eat the
air,
    promise-cramm'd. You cannot feed capons so.
  King. I have nothing with th
is answer, Hamlet. These words are
not
    mine.
  Ham. No, nor mine now. [To Polonius] My lord, 
you play'd once
    i' th' university, you say?
  Pol. That did I, my lord, and was accounted a go
od actor.
  Ham. What did you enact?
  Pol. I did enact Julius Caesar; I was kill'd i' th' Capitol
;
Brutus
    kill'd me.
  Ham. It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf
there. Be
 
   the players ready.
  Ros. Ay, my lord. They stay upon your patience.
  Queen. Come hither, my d
ear Hamlet, sit by me.
  Ham. No, good mother. Here's metal more attractive.
  Pol. [to the King] 
O, ho! do you mark that?
  Ham. Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
                                  [
Sits down at Ophelia's feet.]

  Oph. No, my lord.
  Ham. I mean, my head upon your lap?
  Oph. 
Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Do you think I meant country matters?
  Oph. I think nothing, my lord.
  Ham.
 That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
  Oph. What is, my lord?
  Ham. Nothing.
  Oph
. You are merry, my lord.
  Ham. Who, I?
  Oph. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. O God, your only jig-maker! W
hat should a man do but be
merry?
    For look you how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father

died
    within 's two hours.
  Oph. Nay 'tis twice two months, my lord.
  Ham. So long? Nay then
, let the devil wear black, for I'll have
a
    suit of sables. O heavens! die two months ago, and
 not
forgotten
    yet? Then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his
life
    half a y
ear. But, by'r Lady, he must build churches then; or
else
    shall he suffer not thinking on, wit
h the hobby-horse, whose

    epitaph is 'For O, for O, the hobby-horse is forgot!'

           
    Hautboys play. The dumb show enters.

    Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen em
bracing
    him and he her. She kneels, and makes show of protestation
    unto him. He takes her 
up, and declines his head upon her
    neck. He lays him down upon a bank of flowers. She, seeing

    him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his
    crown, kisses it, pours poiso
n in the sleeper's ears, and
    leaves him. The Queen returns, finds the King dead, and makes
   
 passionate action. The Poisoner with some three or four
Mutes,
    comes in again, seem to condol
e with her. The dead body is
    carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with gifts; she
    se
ems harsh and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts
    his love.
                             
                            Exeunt.

  Oph. What means this, my lord?
  Ham. Marry, this is michi
ng malhecho; it means mischief.
  Oph. Belike this show imports the argument of the play.

      
                Enter Prologue.

  Ham. We shall know by this fellow. The players cannot keep
cou
nsel;
    they'll tell all.
  Oph. Will he tell us what this show meant?
  Ham. Ay, or any show t
hat you'll show him. Be not you asham'd
to
    show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means.
 
 Oph. You are naught, you are naught! I'll mark the play.

    Pro. For us, and for our tragedy,

      Here stooping to your clemency,
      We beg your hearing patiently.                     [Exi
t.]

  Ham. Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
  Oph. 'Tis brief, my lord.
  Ham. As wom
an's love.

              Enter [two Players as] King and Queen.

    King. Full thirty times ha
th Phoebus' cart gone round
      Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
      And thirty d
ozen moons with borrowed sheen
      About the world have times twelve thirties been,
      Since 
love our hearts, and Hymen did our hands,
      Unite comutual in most sacred bands.
    Queen. So
 many journeys may the sun and moon
      Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
      But woe
 is me! you are so sick of late,
      So far from cheer and from your former state.
      That I 
distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
      Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must;
      For wo
men's fear and love holds quantity,
      In neither aught, or in extremity.
      Now what my lov
e is, proof hath made you know;
      And as my love is siz'd, my fear is so.
      Where love is 
great, the littlest doubts are fear;
      Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.

    King. Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;
      My operant powers their functions 
leave to do.
      And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
      Honour'd, belov'd, and hap
ly one as kind
      For husband shalt thou-
    Queen. O, confound the rest!
      Such love mus
t needs be treason in my breast.
      When second husband let me be accurst!
      None wed the s
econd but who killed the first.

  Ham. [aside] Wormwood, wormwood!

    Queen. The instances th
at second marriage move
      Are base respects of thrift, but none of love.
      A second time I
 kill my husband dead
      When second husband kisses me in bed.
    King. I do believe you think
 what now you speak;
      But what we do determine oft we break.
      Purpose is but the slave t
o memory,
      Of violent birth, but poor validity;
      Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on
 the tree,
      But fall unshaken when they mellow be.
      Most necessary 'tis that we forget

      To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt.
      What to ourselves in passion we propose,
 
     The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
      The violence of either grief or joy
      Th
eir own enactures with themselves destroy.
      Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
  
    Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
      This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not str
ange
      That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
      For 'tis a question left us 
yet to prove,
      Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
      The great man down, you
 mark his favourite flies,
      The poor advanc'd makes friends of enemies;
      And hitherto do
th love on fortune tend,
      For who not needs shall never lack a friend,
      And who in want 
a hollow friend doth try,
      Directly seasons him his enemy.
      But, orderly to end where I 
begun,
      Our wills and fates do so contrary run
      That our devices still are overthrown;

      Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own.
      So think thou wilt no second husband
 wed;
      But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
    Queen. Nor earth to me give food
, nor heaven light,
      Sport and repose lock from me day and night,
      To desperation turn m
y trust and hope,
      An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope,
      Each opposite that blanks t
he face of joy
      Meet what I would have well, and it destroy,
      Both here and hence pursue
 me lasting strife,
      If, once a widow, ever I be wife!

  Ham. If she should break it now!


    King. 'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile.
      My spirits grow dull, and fain I 
would beguile
      The tedious day with sleep.
    Queen. Sleep rock thy brain,
                
                                    [He] sleeps.
      And never come mischance between us twain!

Exit.

  Ham. Madam, how like you this play?
  Queen. The lady doth protest too much, methinks.

  Ham. O, but she'll keep her word.
  King. Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in't?

  Ham. No, no! They do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i'
th'
    world.
  King. What do yo
u call the play?
  Ham. 'The Mousetrap.' Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the
    image of a m
urther done in Vienna. Gonzago is the duke's
name;
    his wife, Baptista. You shall see anon. 'Ti
s a knavish piece
of
    work; but what o' that? Your Majesty, and we that have free
    souls, i
t touches us not. Let the gall'd jade winch; our
withers
    are unwrung.

                     
    Enter Lucianus.

    This is one Lucianus, nephew to the King.
  Oph. You are as good as a ch
orus, my lord.
  Ham. I could interpret between you and your love, if I could
see
    the puppets
 dallying.
  Oph. You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
  Ham. It would cost you a groaning to take
 off my edge.
  Oph. Still better, and worse.
  Ham. So you must take your husbands.- Begin, murth
erer. Pox,
leave
    thy damnable faces, and begin! Come, the croaking raven doth
    bellow for 
revenge.

    Luc. Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
      Confederate sea
son, else no creature seeing;
      Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,
      With Hec
ate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,
      Thy natural magic and dire property
      On whol
esome life usurp immediately.
                                   Pours the poison in his ears.

 
 Ham. He poisons him i' th' garden for's estate. His name's
Gonzago.
    The story is extant, and 
written in very choice Italian. You
    shall see anon how the murtherer gets the love of Gonzago's

wife.
  Oph. The King rises.
  Ham. What, frighted with false fire?
  Queen. How fares my lord?

  Pol. Give o'er the play.
  King. Give me some light! Away!
  All. Lights, lights, lights!
   
                           Exeunt all but Hamlet and Horatio.
  Ham.   Why, let the strucken deer g
o weep,
          The hart ungalled play;
         For some must watch, while some must sleep:
  
        Thus runs the world away.
    Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers- if the rest of

my
    fortunes turn Turk with me-with two Provincial roses on my
raz'd
    shoes, get me a fel
lowship in a cry of players, sir?
  Hor. Half a share.
  Ham.   A whole one I!
         For thou 
dost know, O Damon dear,
           This realm dismantled was
         Of Jove himself; and now re
igns here
           A very, very- pajock.
  Hor. You might have rhym'd.
  Ham. O good Horatio, I
'll take the ghost's word for a thousand
    pound! Didst perceive?
  Hor. Very well, my lord.
  
Ham. Upon the talk of the poisoning?
  Hor. I did very well note him.
  Ham.   Aha! Come, some mus
ic! Come, the recorders!
         For if the King like not the comedy,
         Why then, belike h
e likes it not, perdy.
    Come, some music!

                Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.


  Guil. Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.
  Ham. Sir, a whole history.
  Guil. The K
ing, sir-
  Ham. Ay, sir, what of him?
  Guil. Is in his retirement, marvellous distemper'd.
  Ha
m. With drink, sir?
  Guil. No, my lord; rather with choler.
  Ham. Your wisdom should show itself
 more richer to signify this
to
    the doctor; for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps

    plunge him into far more choler.
  Guil. Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame, and

start
    not so wildly from my affair.
  Ham. I am tame, sir; pronounce.
  Guil. The Queen, you
r mother, in most great affliction of
spirit
    hath sent me to you.
  Ham. You are welcome.
  
Guil. Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right
breed.
    If it shall please you to ma
ke me a wholesome answer, I will
do
    your mother's commandment; if not, your pardon and my retu
rn
    shall be the end of my business.
  Ham. Sir, I cannot.
  Guil. What, my lord?
  Ham. Make
 you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseas'd. But, sir,
such
    answer as I can make, you shall com
mand; or rather, as you
say,
    my mother. Therefore no more, but to the matter! My mother,
you

    say-
  Ros. Then thus she says: your behaviour hath struck her into
    amazement and admirat
ion.
  Ham. O wonderful son, that can so stonish a mother! But is
there no
    sequel at the heel
s of this mother's admiration? Impart.
  Ros. She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you g
o to
bed.
  Ham. We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any
    further trade wit
h us?
  Ros. My lord, you once did love me.
  Ham. And do still, by these pickers and stealers!
 
 Ros. Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? You do
surely
    bar the door upon your own 
liberty, if you deny your griefs
to
    your friend.
  Ham. Sir, I lack advancement.
  Ros. How 
can that be, when you have the voice of the King
himself
    for your succession in Denmark?
  Ha
m. Ay, sir, but 'while the grass grows'- the proverb is
something
    musty.

                  
   Enter the Players with recorders.

    O, the recorders! Let me see one. To withdraw with you- 
why
do
    you go about to recover the wind of me, as if you would drive
me
    into a toil?
  
Guil. O my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too
unmannerly.
  Ham. I do not well understan
d that. Will you play upon this
pipe?
  Guil. My lord, I cannot.
  Ham. I pray you.
  Guil. Beli
eve me, I cannot.
  Ham. I do beseech you.
  Guil. I know, no touch of it, my lord.
  Ham. It is 
as easy as lying. Govern these ventages with your
    fingers and thumbs, give it breath with your 
mouth, and it
will
    discourse most eloquent music. Look you, these are the stops.
  Guil. But 
these cannot I command to any utt'rance of harmony. I
    have not the skill.
  Ham. Why, look you
 now, how unworthy a thing you make of me!
You
    would play upon me; you would seem to know my s
tops; you
would
    pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound me from my
    lowest note
 to the top of my compass; and there is much
music,
    excellent voice, in this little organ, yet
 cannot you make it
    speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am easier to be play'd on than
a
    pipe?
 Call me what instrument you will, though you can fret
me,
    you cannot play upon me.

       
                 Enter Polonius.

    God bless you, sir!
  Pol. My lord, the Queen would speak w
ith you, and presently.
  Ham. Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
  Pol. B
y th' mass, and 'tis like a camel indeed.
  Ham. Methinks it is like a weasel.
  Pol. It is back'd
 like a weasel.
  Ham. Or like a whale.
  Pol. Very like a whale.
  Ham. Then will I come to my m
other by-and-by.- They fool me to
the
    top of my bent.- I will come by-and-by.
  Pol. I will s
ay so.                                      Exit.
  Ham. 'By-and-by' is easily said.- Leave me, fri
ends.
                                        [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]

    'Tis now the very wit
ching time of night,
    When churchyards yawn, and hell itself breathes out
    Contagion to this
 world. Now could I drink hot blood
    And do such bitter business as the day
    Would quake to 
look on. Soft! now to my mother!
    O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever
    The soul of Ne
ro enter this firm bosom.
    Let me be cruel, not unnatural;
    I will speak daggers to her, but
 use none.
    My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites-
    How in my words somever she be shent,

    To give them seals never, my soul, consent!             Exit.




Scene III.
A room in t
he Castle.

Enter King, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.

  King. I like him not, nor stands it sa
fe with us
    To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;
    I your commission will forthwi
th dispatch,
    And he to England shall along with you.
    The terms of our estate may not endur
e
    Hazard so near us as doth hourly grow
    Out of his lunacies.
  Guil. We will ourselves pr
ovide.
    Most holy and religious fear it is
    To keep those many many bodies safe
    That li
ve and feed upon your Majesty.
  Ros. The single and peculiar life is bound
    With all the stren
gth and armour of the mind
    To keep itself from noyance; but much more
    That spirit upon who
se weal depends and rests
    The lives of many. The cesse of majesty
    Dies not alone, but like
 a gulf doth draw
    What's near it with it. It is a massy wheel,
    Fix'd on the summit of the 
highest mount,
    To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
    Are mortis'd and adjoin'd; 
which when it falls,
    Each small annexment, petty consequence,
    Attends the boist'rous ruin.
 Never alone
    Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.
  King. Arm you, I pray you, to this
 speedy voyage;
    For we will fetters put upon this fear,
    Which now goes too free-footed.
 
 Both. We will haste us.
                                               Exeunt Gentlemen.

      
             Enter Polonius.

  Pol. My lord, he's going to his mother's closet.
    Behind the a
rras I'll convey myself
    To hear the process. I'll warrant she'll tax him home;
    And, as you
 said, and wisely was it said,
    'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,
    Since natu
re makes them partial, should o'erhear
    The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege.
    I'
ll call upon you ere you go to bed
    And tell you what I know.
  King. Thanks, dear my lord.
  
                                              Exit [Polonius].
    O, my offence is rank, it smells
 to heaven;
    It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,
    A brother's murther! Pray can I not,

    Though inclination be as sharp as will.
    My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent,
    An
d, like a man to double business bound,
    I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
    And bo
th neglect. What if this cursed hand
    Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,
    Is the
re not rain enough in the sweet heavens
    To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
    But
 to confront the visage of offence?
    And what's in prayer but this twofold force,
    To be for
estalled ere we come to fall,
    Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;
    My fault is past.
 But, O, what form of prayer
    Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murther'?
    That cannot 
be; since I am still possess'd
    Of those effects for which I did the murther-
    My crown, min
e own ambition, and my queen.
    May one be pardon'd and retain th' offence?
    In the corrupted
 currents of this world
    Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,
    And oft 'tis seen the 
wicked prize itself
    Buys out the law; but 'tis not so above.
    There is no shuffling; there 
the action lies
    In his true nature, and we ourselves compell'd,
    Even to the teeth and fore
head of our faults,
    To give in evidence. What then? What rests?
    Try what repentance can. W
hat can it not?
    Yet what can it when one cannot repent?
    O wretched state! O bosom black as
 death!
    O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
    Art more engag'd! Help, angels! Make as
say.
    Bow, stubborn knees; and heart with strings of steel,
    Be soft as sinews of the new-bo
rn babe!
    All may be well.                                  He kneels.

                      
   Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
    And now I'll do't. And so 
he goes to heaven,
    And so am I reveng'd. That would be scann'd.
    A villain kills my father;
 and for that,
    I, his sole son, do this same villain send
    To heaven.
    Why, this is hir
e and salary, not revenge!
    He took my father grossly, full of bread,
    With all his crimes b
road blown, as flush as May;
    And how his audit stands, who knows save heaven?
    But in our c
ircumstance and course of thought,
    'Tis heavy with him; and am I then reveng'd,
    To take hi
m in the purging of his soul,
    When he is fit and seasoned for his passage?
    No.
    Up, sw
ord, and know thou a more horrid hent.
    When he is drunk asleep; or in his rage;
    Or in th' 
incestuous pleasure of his bed;
    At gaming, swearing, or about some act
    That has no relish 
of salvation in't-
    Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,
    And that his soul may
 be as damn'd and black
    As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays.
    This physic but prolong
s thy sickly days.              Exit.
  King. [rises] My words fly up, my thoughts remain below.
 
   Words without thoughts never to heaven go.             Exit.




Scene IV.
The Queen's clos
et.

Enter Queen and Polonius.

  Pol. He will come straight. Look you lay home to him.
    Tel
l him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,
    And that your Grace hath screen'd and stood 
between
    Much heat and him. I'll silence me even here.
    Pray you be round with him.
  Ham. 
(within) Mother, mother, mother!
  Queen. I'll warrant you; fear me not. Withdraw; I hear him
comi
ng.
                              [Polonius hides behind the arras.]

                          E
nter Hamlet.

  Ham. Now, mother, what's the matter?
  Queen. Hamlet, thou hast thy father much o
ffended.
  Ham. Mother, you have my father much offended.
  Queen. Come, come, you answer with an 
idle tongue.
  Ham. Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
  Queen. Why, how now, Hamlet?
  H
am. What's the matter now?
  Queen. Have you forgot me?
  Ham. No, by the rood, not so!
    You a
re the Queen, your husband's brother's wife,
    And (would it were not so!) you are my mother.
  
Queen. Nay, then I'll set those to you that can speak.
  Ham. Come, come, and sit you down. You sha
ll not budge;
    You go not till I set you up a glass
    Where you may see the inmost part of yo
u.
  Queen. What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murther me?
    Help, help, ho!
  Pol. [behind] What
, ho! help, help, help!
  Ham. [draws] How now? a rat? Dead for a ducat, dead!
            [Makes 
a pass through the arras and] kills Polonius.
  Pol. [behind] O, I am slain!
  Queen. O me, what h
ast thou done?
  Ham. Nay, I know not. Is it the King?
  Queen. O, what a rash and bloody deed is 
this!
  Ham. A bloody deed- almost as bad, good mother,
    As kill a king, and marry with his bro
ther.
  Queen. As kill a king?
  Ham. Ay, lady, it was my word.
                         [Lifts u
p the arras and sees Polonius.]
    Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
    I took thee
 for thy better. Take thy fortune.
    Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.
    Leave wring
ing of your hands. Peace! sit you down
    And let me wring your heart; for so I shall
    If it b
e made of penetrable stuff;
    If damned custom have not braz'd it so
    That it is proof and bu
lwark against sense.
  Queen. What have I done that thou dar'st wag thy tongue
    In noise so rud
e against me?
  Ham. Such an act
    That blurs the grace and blush of modesty;
    Calls virtue 
hypocrite; takes off the rose
    From the fair forehead of an innocent love,
    And sets a blist
er there; makes marriage vows
    As false as dicers' oaths. O, such a deed
    As from the body o
f contraction plucks
    The very soul, and sweet religion makes
    A rhapsody of words! Heaven's
 face doth glow;
    Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
    With tristful visage, as against th
e doom,
    Is thought-sick at the act.
  Queen. Ah me, what act,
    That roars so loud and thun
ders in the index?
  Ham. Look here upon th's picture, and on this,
    The counterfeit presentmen
t of two brothers.
    See what a grace was seated on this brow;
    Hyperion's curls; the front o
f Jove himself;
    An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
    A station like the herald Mercu
ry
    New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill:
    A combination and a form indeed
    Where every 
god did seem to set his seal
    To give the world assurance of a man.
    This was your husband. 
Look you now what follows.
    Here is your husband, like a mildew'd ear
    Blasting his wholesom
e brother. Have you eyes?
    Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
    And batten on thi
s moor? Ha! have you eyes
    You cannot call it love; for at your age
    The heyday in the blood
 is tame, it's humble,
    And waits upon the judgment; and what judgment
    Would step from this
 to this? Sense sure you have,
    Else could you not have motion; but sure that sense
    Is apop
lex'd; for madness would not err,
    Nor sense to ecstacy was ne'er so thrall'd
    But it reserv
'd some quantity of choice
    To serve in such a difference. What devil was't
    That thus hath 
cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
    Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
    Ears without ha
nds or eyes, smelling sans all,
    Or but a sickly part of one true sense
    Could not so mope.

    O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
    If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
 
   To flaming youth let virtue be as wax
    And melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame
    When 
the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
    Since frost itself as actively doth burn,
    And reas
on panders will.
  Queen. O Hamlet, speak no more!
    Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul,

    And there I see such black and grained spots
    As will not leave their tinct.
  Ham. Nay, bu
t to live
    In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
    Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making 
love
    Over the nasty sty!
  Queen. O, speak to me no more!
    These words like daggers enter 
in mine ears.
    No more, sweet Hamlet!
  Ham. A murtherer and a villain!
    A slave that is no
t twentieth part the tithe
    Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
    A cutpurse of the empi
re and the rule,
    That from a shelf the precious diadem stole
    And put it in his pocket!
  
Queen. No more!

                Enter the Ghost in his nightgown.

  Ham. A king of shreds and 
patches!-
    Save me and hover o'er me with your wings,
    You heavenly guards! What would your 
gracious figure?
  Queen. Alas, he's mad!
  Ham. Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
    Tha
t, laps'd in time and passion, lets go by
    Th' important acting of your dread command?
    O, s
ay!
  Ghost. Do not forget. This visitation
    Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
    Bu
t look, amazement on thy mother sits.
    O, step between her and her fighting soul
    Conceit in
 weakest bodies strongest works.
    Speak to her, Hamlet.
  Ham. How is it with you, lady?
  Que
en. Alas, how is't with you,
    That you do bend your eye on vacancy,
    And with th' encorporal
 air do hold discourse?
    Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
    And, as the sleeping 
soldiers in th' alarm,
    Your bedded hairs, like life in excrements,
    Start up and stand an e
nd. O gentle son,
    Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
    Sprinkle cool patience! Whereon
 do you look?
  Ham. On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!
    His form and cause conjoin'd
, preaching to stones,
    Would make them capable.- Do not look upon me,
    Lest with this piteo
us action you convert
    My stern effects. Then what I have to do
    Will want true colour- tear
s perchance for blood.
  Queen. To whom do you speak this?
  Ham. Do you see nothing there?
  Que
en. Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
  Ham. Nor did you nothing hear?
  Queen. No, nothing b
ut ourselves.
  Ham. Why, look you there! Look how it steals away!
    My father, in his habit as 
he liv'd!
    Look where he goes even now out at the portal!
                                     
                Exit Ghost.
  Queen. This is the very coinage of your brain.
    This bodiless cre
ation ecstasy
    Is very cunning in.
  Ham. Ecstasy?
    My pulse as yours doth temperately keep
 time
    And makes as healthful music. It is not madness
    That I have utt'red. Bring me to the
 test,
    And I the matter will reword; which madness
    Would gambol from. Mother, for love of 
grace,
    Lay not that flattering unction to your soul
    That not your trespass but my madness 
speaks.
    It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
    Whiles rank corruption, mining all w
ithin,
    Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
    Repent what's past; avoid what is to co
me;
    And do not spread the compost on the weeds
    To make them ranker. Forgive me this my vir
tue;
    For in the fatness of these pursy times
    Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg-
    Y
ea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.
  Queen. O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
 
 Ham. O, throw away the worser part of it,
    And live the purer with the other half,
    Good ni
ght- but go not to my uncle's bed.
    Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
    That monster, cust
om, who all sense doth eat
    Of habits evil, is angel yet in this,
    That to the use of action
s fair and good
    He likewise gives a frock or livery,
    That aptly is put on. Refrain to-nigh
t,
    And that shall lend a kind of easiness
    To the next abstinence; the next more easy;
   
 For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
    And either [master] the devil, or throw him out

    With wondrous potency. Once more, good night;
    And when you are desirous to be blest,
   
 I'll blessing beg of you.- For this same lord,
    I do repent; but heaven hath pleas'd it so,
  
  To punish me with this, and this with me,
    That I must be their scourge and minister.
    I w
ill bestow him, and will answer well
    The death I gave him. So again, good night.
    I must be
 cruel, only to be kind;
    Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.
    One word more, good la
dy.
  Queen. What shall I do?
  Ham. Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
    Let the bloat 
King tempt you again to bed;
    Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
    And let him, 
for a pair of reechy kisses,
    Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,
    Make you to
 ravel all this matter out,
    That I essentially am not in madness,
    But mad in craft. 'Twere
 good you let him know;
    For who that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
    Would from a paddoc
k, from a bat, a gib
    Such dear concernings hide? Who would do so?
    No, in despite of sense 
and secrecy,
    Unpeg the basket on the house's top,
    Let the birds fly, and like the famous a
pe,
    To try conclusions, in the basket creep
    And break your own neck down.
  Queen. Be tho
u assur'd, if words be made of breath,
    And breath of life, I have no life to breathe
    What 
thou hast said to me.
  Ham. I must to England; you know that?
  Queen. Alack,
    I had forgot! 
'Tis so concluded on.
  Ham. There's letters seal'd; and my two schoolfellows,
    Whom I will tru
st as I will adders fang'd,
    They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way
    And marshal me t
o knavery. Let it work;
    For 'tis the sport to have the enginer
    Hoist with his own petar; a
nd 't shall go hard
    But I will delve one yard below their mines
    And blow them at the moon.
 O, 'tis most sweet
    When in one line two crafts directly meet.
    This man shall set me packi
ng.
    I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.-
    Mother, good night.- Indeed, this counsell
or
    Is now most still, most secret, and most grave,
    Who was in life a foolish peating knave
.
    Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.
    Good night, mother.
                  [Exit 
the Queen. Then] Exit Hamlet, tugging in
                                                       Pol
onius.

ACT IV. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King and Quee
n, with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  King. There's matter in these sighs. These profound heave
s
    You must translate; 'tis fit we understand them.
    Where is your son?
  Queen. Bestow thi
s place on us a little while.
                          [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
   
 Ah, mine own lord, what have I seen to-night!
  King. What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
  Queen. M
ad as the sea and wind when both contend
    Which is the mightier. In his lawless fit
    Behind 
the arras hearing something stir,
    Whips out his rapier, cries 'A rat, a rat!'
    And in this 
brainish apprehension kills
    The unseen good old man.
  King. O heavy deed!
    It had been so
 with us, had we been there.
    His liberty is full of threats to all-
    To you yourself, to us
, to every one.
    Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
    It will be laid to us, whose
 providence
    Should have kept short, restrain'd, and out of haunt
    This mad young man. But s
o much was our love
    We would not understand what was most fit,
    But, like the owner of a fo
ul disease,
    To keep it from divulging, let it feed
    Even on the pith of life. Where is he g
one?
  Queen. To draw apart the body he hath kill'd;
    O'er whom his very madness, like some ore

    Among a mineral of metals base,
    Shows itself pure. He weeps for what is done.
  King. O 
Gertrude, come away!
    The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch
    But we will ship him henc
e; and this vile deed
    We must with all our majesty and skill
    Both countenance and excuse. 
Ho, Guildenstern!

             Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

    Friends both, go join y
ou with some further aid.
    Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
    And from his mother's clo
set hath he dragg'd him.
    Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body
    Into the chapel. 
I pray you haste in this.
                          Exeunt [Rosencrantz and Guildenstern].
    Com
e, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends
    And let them know both what we mean to do
    An
d what's untimely done. [So haply slander-]
    Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter,
    As le
vel as the cannon to his blank,
    Transports his poisoned shot- may miss our name
    And hit th
e woundless air.- O, come away!
    My soul is full of discord and dismay.
                       
                                  Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A passage in the Castle.


Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Safely stow'd.
  Gentlemen. (within) Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!
  Ham. But soft!
 What noise? Who calls on Hamlet? O, here they
come.

               Enter Rosencrantz and Guilde
nstern.

  Ros. What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
  Ham. Compounded it with dust, 
whereto 'tis kin.
  Ros. Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
    And bear it to the cha
pel.
  Ham. Do not believe it.
  Ros. Believe what?
  Ham. That I can keep your counsel, and not 
mine own. Besides,
to be
    demanded of a sponge, what replication should be made by the
son
  
  of a king?
  Ros. Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
  Ham. Ay, sir; that soaks up the King's co
untenance, his
rewards,
    his authorities. But such officers do the King best service
in
    t
he end. He keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his
jaw;
    first mouth'd, to be last swallo
wed. When he needs what you
have
    glean'd, it is but squeezing you and, sponge, you shall be
d
ry
    again.
  Ros. I understand you not, my lord.
  Ham. I am glad of it. A knavish speech slee
ps in a foolish ear.
  Ros. My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us
to
    the
 King.
  Ham. The body is with the King, but the King is not with the
body.
    The King is a thi
ng-
  Guil. A thing, my lord?
  Ham. Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.
      
                                                   Exeunt.




Scene III.
Elsinore. A room in 
the Castle.

Enter King.

  King. I have sent to seek him and to find the body.
    How dangero
us is it that this man goes loose!
    Yet must not we put the strong law on him.
    He's lov'd o
f the distracted multitude,
    Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;
    And where 'tis
 so, th' offender's scourge is weigh'd,
    But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,
  
  This sudden sending him away must seem
    Deliberate pause. Diseases desperate grown
    By des
perate appliance are reliev'd,
    Or not at all.

                    Enter Rosencrantz.

    
How now O What hath befall'n?
  Ros. Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
    We cannot get f
rom him.
  King. But where is he?
  Ros. Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
  King
. Bring him before us.
  Ros. Ho, Guildenstern! Bring in my lord.

        Enter Hamlet and Guild
enstern [with Attendants].

  King. Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
  Ham. At supper.
  King. At 
supper? Where?
  Ham. Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A certain
    convocation of polit
ic worms are e'en at him. Your worm is
your
    only emperor for diet. We fat all creatures else t
o fat us,
and
    we fat ourselves for maggots. Your fat king and your lean
beggar
    is but va
riable service- two dishes, but to one table. That's
the
    end.
  King. Alas, alas!
  Ham. A m
an may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and
eat
    of the fish that hath fed of that w
orm.
  King. What dost thou mean by this?
  Ham. Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progr
ess
through
    the guts of a beggar.
  King. Where is Polonius?
  Ham. In heaven. Send thither 
to see. If your messenger find him
not
    there, seek him i' th' other place yourself. But indeed
, if
you
    find him not within this month, you shall nose him as you go
up
    the stair, into
 the lobby.
  King. Go seek him there. [To Attendants.]
  Ham. He will stay till you come.
      
                                      [Exeunt Attendants.]
  King. Hamlet, this deed, for thine esp
ecial safety,-
    Which we do tender as we dearly grieve
    For that which thou hast done,- must
 send thee hence
    With fiery quickness. Therefore prepare thyself.
    The bark is ready and th
e wind at help,

    For England.
  Ham. For Engla
nd?
  King. Ay, Hamlet.
  Ham. Good.
  King. So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
  Ham. I se
e a cherub that sees them. But come, for England!
    Farewell, dear mother.
  King. Thy loving fa
ther, Hamlet.
  Ham. My mother! Father and mother is man and wife; man and wife
is
    one flesh;
 and so, my mother. Come, for England!
Exit.
  King. Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboa
rd.
    Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night.
    Away! for everything is seal'd and done
 
   That else leans on th' affair. Pray you make haste.
                            Exeunt Rosencran
tz and Guildenstern]
    And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught,-
    As my great power th
ereof may give thee sense,
    Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
    After the Danish swor
d, and thy free awe
    Pays homage to us,- thou mayst not coldly set
    Our sovereign process, w
hich imports at full,
    By letters congruing to that effect,
    The present death of Hamlet. Do
 it, England;
    For like the hectic in my blood he rages,
    And thou must cure me. Till I know
 'tis done,
    Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.             Exit.

cene IV.
Near Elsinore.

Enter Fortinbras with his Army over the stage.

  For. Go, Captain, fr
om me greet the Danish king.
    Tell him that by his license Fortinbras
    Craves the conveyance
 of a promis'd march
    Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.
    If that his Majesty would 
aught with us,
    We shall express our duty in his eye;
    And let him know so.
  Capt. I will 
do't, my lord.
  For. Go softly on.
                                   Exeunt [all but the Captain
].

       Enter Hamlet, Rosencrantz, [Guildenstern,] and others.

  Ham. Good sir, whose powers
 are these?
  Capt. They are of Norway, sir.
  Ham. How purpos'd, sir, I pray you?
  Capt. Agains
t some part of Poland.
  Ham. Who commands them, sir?
  Capt. The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras
.
  Ham. Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
    Or for some frontier?
  Capt. Truly to spea
k, and with no addition,
    We go to gain a little patch of ground
    That hath in it no profit 
but the name.
    To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
    Nor will it yield to Norway o
r the Pole
    A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
  Ham. Why, then the Polack never will def
end it.
  Capt. Yes, it is already garrison'd.
  Ham. Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducat
s
    Will not debate the question of this straw.
    This is th' imposthume of much wealth and pe
ace,
    That inward breaks, and shows no cause without
    Why the man dies.- I humbly thank you,
 sir.
  Capt. God b' wi' you, sir.                             [Exit.]
  Ros. Will't please you go
, my lord?
  Ham. I'll be with you straight. Go a little before.
                                 
       [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]
    How all occasions do inform against me
    And spur my dull re
venge! What is a man,
    If his chief good and market of his time
    Be but to sleep and feed? A
 beast, no more.
    Sure he that made us with such large discourse,
    Looking before and after,
 gave us not
    That capability and godlike reason
    To fust in us unus'd. Now, whether it be

    Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple
    Of thinking too precisely on th' event,-
    A th
ought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
    And ever three parts coward,- I do not know
 
   Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do,'
    Sith I have cause, and will, and strength, and m
eans
    To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me.
    Witness this army of such mass and charge
,
    Led by a delicate and tender prince,
    Whose spirit, with divine ambition puff'd,
    Mak
es mouths at the invisible event,
    Exposing what is mortal and unsure
    To all that fortune, 
death, and danger dare,
    Even for an eggshell. Rightly to be great
    Is not to stir without g
reat argument,
    But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
    When honour's at the stake. How stan
d I then,
    That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,
    Excitements of my reason and my blo
od,
    And let all sleep, while to my shame I see
    The imminent death of twenty thousand men

    That for a fantasy and trick of fame
    Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot
    Wh
ereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
    Which is not tomb enough and continent
    To hide the
 slain? O, from this time forth,
    My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!            Exit.

Scene V.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter Horatio, Queen, and a Gentlem
an.

  Queen. I will not speak with her.
  Gent. She is importunate, indeed distract.
    Her mo
od will needs be pitied.
  Queen. What would she have?
  Gent. She speaks much of her father; says
 she hears
    There's tricks i' th' world, and hems, and beats her heart;
    Spurns enviously at
 straws; speaks things in doubt,
    That carry but half sense. Her speech is nothing,
    Yet the
 unshaped use of it doth move
    The hearers to collection; they aim at it,
    And botch the wor
ds up fit to their own thoughts;
    Which, as her winks and nods and gestures yield them,
    Ind
eed would make one think there might be thought,
    Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
  Ho
r. 'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew
    Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding mi
nds.
  Queen. Let her come in.
                                               [Exit Gentleman.]
 
   [Aside] To my sick soul (as sin's true nature is)
    Each toy seems Prologue to some great amis
s.
    So full of artless jealousy is guilt
    It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.

      
           Enter Ophelia distracted.

  Oph. Where is the beauteous Majesty of Denmark?
  Queen. 
How now, Ophelia?
  Oph. (sings)
         How should I your true-love know
           From anothe
r one?
         By his cockle bat and' staff
           And his sandal shoon.

  Queen. Alas, sw
eet lady, what imports this song?
  Oph. Say you? Nay, pray You mark.

    (Sings) He is dead and
 gone, lady,
              He is dead and gone;
            At his head a grass-green turf,
     
         At his heels a stone.

    O, ho!
  Queen. Nay, but Ophelia-
  Oph. Pray you mark.

 
   (Sings) White his shroud as the mountain snow-

                    Enter King.

  Queen. Ala
s, look here, my lord!
  Oph. (Sings)
           Larded all with sweet flowers;
         Which be
wept to the grave did not go
           With true-love showers.

  King. How do you, pretty lady?

  Oph. Well, God dild you! They say the owl was a baker's
daughter.
    Lord, we know what we ar
e, but know not what we may be. God
be at
    your table!
  King. Conceit upon her father.
  Oph
. Pray let's have no words of this; but when they ask, you
what
    it means, say you this:

   
 (Sings) To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,
              All in the morning bedtime,
           
 And I a maid at your window,
              To be your Valentine.

            Then up he rose an
d donn'd his clo'es
              And dupp'd the chamber door,
            Let in the maid, that o
ut a maid
              Never departed more.

  King. Pretty Ophelia!
  Oph. Indeed, la, without
 an oath, I'll make an end on't!

    [Sings] By Gis and by Saint Charity,
              Alack, a
nd fie for shame!
            Young men will do't if they come to't
              By Cock, they ar
e to blame.

            Quoth she, 'Before you tumbled me,
              You promis'd me to wed.
'

    He answers:

            'So would I 'a' done, by yonder sun,
              An thou hads
t not come to my bed.'

  King. How long hath she been thus?
  Oph. I hope all will be well. We m
ust be patient; but I cannot
    choose but weep to think they would lay him i' th' cold
ground.

    My brother shall know of it; and so I thank you for your good
    counsel. Come, my coach! Good
 night, ladies. Good night,
sweet
    ladies. Good night, good night.                         Exit

  King. Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.
                                      
           [Exit Horatio.]

    O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs
    All from her 
father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
    When sorrows come, they come not single spies.
    But i
n battalions! First, her father slain;
    Next, your son gone, and he most violent author
    Of 
his own just remove; the people muddied,
    Thick and and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispe
rs
    For good Polonius' death, and we have done but greenly
    In hugger-mugger to inter him; p
oor Ophelia
    Divided from herself and her fair judgment,
    Without the which we are pictures 
or mere beasts;
    Last, and as much containing as all these,
    Her brother is in secret come f
rom France;
    And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
    Feeds on his wonder, keep, himself in 
clouds,
    With pestilent speeches of his father's death,
    Wherein necessity, of matter beggar
'd,
    Will nothing stick our person to arraign
    In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
  
  Like to a murd'ring piece, in many places
    Give me superfluous death.                  A noise
 within.
  Queen. Alack, what noise is this?
  King. Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the doo
r.

                     Enter a Messenger.

    What is the matter?
  Mess. Save Yourself, my 
lord:
    The ocean, overpeering of his list,
    Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
  
  Than Young Laertes, in a riotous head,
    O'erbears Your offices. The rabble call him lord;
   
 And, as the world were now but to begin,
    Antiquity forgot, custom not known,
    The ratifier
s and props of every word,
    They cry 'Choose we! Laertes shall be king!'
    Caps, hands, and t
ongues applaud it to the clouds,
    'Laertes shall be king! Laertes king!'
                      
                           A noise within.
  Queen. How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!
  
  O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!
  King. The doors are broke.

                    En
ter Laertes with others.

  Laer. Where is this king?- Sirs, staid you all without.
  All. No, le
t's come in!
  Laer. I pray you give me leave.
  All. We will, we will!
  Laer. I thank you. Keep
 the door.      [Exeunt his Followers.]
    O thou vile king,
    Give me my father!
  Queen. Cal
mly, good Laertes.
  Laer. That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard;
    Cries cuckold 
to my father; brands the harlot
    Even here between the chaste unsmirched brows
    Of my true m
other.
  King. What is the cause, Laertes,
    That thy rebellion looks so giantlike?
    Let him
 go, Gertrude. Do not fear our person.
    There's such divinity doth hedge a king
    That treaso
n can but peep to what it would,
    Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,
    Why thou art t
hus incens'd. Let him go, Gertrude.
    Speak, man.
  Laer. Where is my father?
  King. Dead.
  
Queen. But not by him!
  King. Let him demand his fill.
  Laer. How came he dead? I'll not be jugg
led with:
    To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil
    Conscience and grace, to the pr
ofoundest pit!
    I dare damnation. To this point I stand,
    That both the world, I give to neg
ligence,
    Let come what comes; only I'll be reveng'd
    Most throughly for my father.
  King.
 Who shall stay you?
  Laer. My will, not all the world!
    And for my means, I'll husband them s
o well
    They shall go far with little.
  King. Good Laertes,
    If you desire to know the cer
tainty
    Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge
    That sweepstake you will dra
w both friend and foe,
    Winner and loser?
  Laer. None but his enemies.
  King. Will you know 
them then?
  Laer. To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms
    And, like the kind life-rend
'ring pelican,
    Repast them with my blood.
  King. Why, now You speak
    Like a good child an
d a true gentleman.
    That I am guiltless of your father's death,
    And am most sensibly in gr
ief for it,
    It shall as level to your judgment pierce
    As day does to your eye.
          
                    A noise within: 'Let her come in.'
  Laer. How now? What noise is that?

    
                  Enter Ophelia.

    O heat, dry up my brains! Tears seven times salt
    Burn o
ut the sense and virtue of mine eye!
    By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight
    Till o
ur scale turn the beam. O rose of May!
    Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
    O heavens! i
s't possible a young maid's wits
    Should be as mortal as an old man's life?
    Nature is fine 
in love, and where 'tis fine,
    It sends some precious instance of itself
    After the thing it
 loves.

  Oph. (sings)
         They bore him barefac'd on the bier
           (Hey non nony, n
ony, hey nony)
         And in his grave rain'd many a tear.

    Fare you well, my dove!
  Laer
. Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
    It could not move thus.
  Oph. You must sin
g 'A-down a-down, and you call him a-down-a.'
O,
    how the wheel becomes it! It is the false ste
ward, that stole
his
    master's daughter.
  Laer. This nothing's more than matter.
  Oph. Ther
e's rosemary, that's for remembrance. Pray you, love,
    remember. And there is pansies, that's fo
r thoughts.
  Laer. A document in madness! Thoughts and remembrance fitted.
  Oph. There's fennel 
for you, and columbines. There's rue for
you,
    and here's some for me. We may call it herb of g
race o'
Sundays.
    O, you must wear your rue with a difference! There's a daisy.
I
    would g
ive you some violets, but they wither'd all when my
father
    died. They say he made a good end.


    [Sings] For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.

  Laer. Thought and affliction, passion, hell
 itself,
    She turns to favour and to prettiness.
  Oph. (sings)
         And will he not come 
again?
         And will he not come again?
           No, no, he is dead;
           Go to thy d
eathbed;
         He never will come again.

         His beard was as white as snow,
         A
ll flaxen was his poll.
           He is gone, he is gone,
           And we cast away moan.
    
     God 'a'mercy on his soul!

    And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God b' wi' you.
Exit.

  Laer. Do you see this, O God?
  King. Laertes, I must commune with your grief,
    Or you deny
 me right. Go but apart,
    Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will,
    And they shall 
hear and judge 'twixt you and me.
    If by direct or by collateral hand
    They find us touch'd,
 we will our kingdom give,
    Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours,
    To you in satis
faction; but if not,
    Be you content to lend your patience to us,
    And we shall jointly labo
ur with your soul
    To give it due content.
  Laer. Let this be so.
    His means of death, his
 obscure funeral-
    No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,
    No noble rite nor formal
 ostentation,-
    Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
    That I must call't in ques
tion.
  King. So you shall;
    And where th' offence is let the great axe fall.
    I pray you g
o with me.
                                                          Exeunt

Enter Horatio with an Attendant.

  Hor. What ar
e they that would speak with me?
  Servant. Seafaring men, sir. They say they have letters for
you
.
  Hor. Let them come in.
                                               [Exit Attendant.]

  Sailor. God bless you, sir.
  Hor. Let him bless thee too.

  Sailor. 'A shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter for
you,
    sir,- it comes from th' 
ambassador that was bound for
England- if

    very warlike appointment gave us chase. Finding ourselves too
    slow of sail, we put on a co
mpelled valour, and in the
grapple I
    boarded them. On the instant they got clear of our ship; 
so I
    alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with me like
thieves
    of mercy; but they
 knew what they did: I am to do a good turn

thou

words
    to s

Scene VII.
Elsinore. Another room in the Castle.

Enter King and Laertes
.

  King. Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
    And You must put me in your heart fo
r friend,
    Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
    That he which hath your noble fathe
r slain
    Pursued my life.
  Laer. It well appears. But tell me
    Why you proceeded not again
st these feats
    So crimeful and so capital in nature,
    As by your safety, wisdom, all things
 else,
    You mainly were stirr'd up.
  King. O, for two special reasons,
    Which may to you, 
perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,
    But yet to me they are strong. The Queen his mother
    Lives al
most by his looks; and for myself,-
    My virtue or my plague, be it either which,-
    She's so 
conjunctive to my life and soul
    That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
    I could not
 but by her. The other motive
    Why to a public count I might not go
    Is the great love the g
eneral gender bear him,
    Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
    Would, like the sp
ring that turneth wood to stone,
    Convert his gives to graces; so that my arrows,
    Too sligh
tly timber'd for so loud a wind,
    Would have reverted to my bow again,
    And not where I had 
aim'd them.
  Laer. And so have I a noble father lost;
    A sister driven into desp'rate terms,

    Whose worth, if praises may go back again,
    Stood challenger on mount of all the age
    Fo
r her perfections. But my revenge will come.
  King. Break not your sleeps for that. You must not t
hink
    That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
    That we can let our beard be shook with da
nger,
    And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more.
    I lov'd your father, and we love 
ourself,
    And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine-

                 Enter a Messenger wit
h letters.

    How now? What news?
  Mess. Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:
    This to your Maje
sty; this to the Queen.
  King. From Hamlet? Who brought them?
  Mess. Sailors, my lord, they say;
 I saw them not.
    They were given me by Claudio; he receiv'd them
    Of him that brought them.

  King. Laertes, you shall hear them.
    Leave us.
                                            
     Exit Messenger.
    [Reads]'High and Mighty,-You shall know I am set naked on
your
    kingd
om. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes;
    when I shall (first asking your pardon
 thereunto) recount the
    occasion of my sudden and more strange return.
                       
                              'HAMLET.'
    What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?
   
 Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?
  Laer. Know you the hand?
  King. 'Tis Hamlet's characte
r. 'Naked!'
    And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'
    Can you advise me?
  Laer. I am lo
st in it, my lord. But let him come!
    It warms the very sickness in my heart
    That I shall l
ive and tell him to his teeth,
    'Thus didest thou.'
  King. If it be so, Laertes
    (As how s
hould it be so? how otherwise?),
    Will you be rul'd by me?
  Laer. Ay my lord,
    So you will
 not o'errule me to a peace.
  King. To thine own peace. If he be now return'd
    As checking at 
his voyage, and that he means
    No more to undertake it, I will work him
    To exploit now ripe
 in my device,
    Under the which he shall not choose but fall;
    And for his death no wind sha
ll breathe
    But even his mother shall uncharge the practice
    And call it accident.
  Laer. 
My lord, I will be rul'd;
    The rather, if you could devise it so
    That I might be the organ.

  King. It falls right.
    You have been talk'd of since your travel much,
    And that in Haml
et's hearing, for a quality
    Wherein they say you shine, Your sum of parts
    Did not together
 pluck such envy from him
    As did that one; and that, in my regard,
    Of the unworthiest sieg
e.
  Laer. What part is that, my lord?
  King. A very riband in the cap of youth-
    Yet needful
l too; for youth no less becomes
    The light and careless livery that it wears
    Than settled 
age his sables and his weeds,
    Importing health and graveness. Two months since
    Here was a 
gentleman of Normandy.
    I have seen myself, and serv'd against, the French,
    And they can we
ll on horseback; but this gallant
    Had witchcraft in't. He grew unto his seat,
    And to such 
wondrous doing brought his horse
    As had he been incorps'd and demi-natur'd
    With the brave 
beast. So far he topp'd my thought
    That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
    Come short of 
what he did.
  Laer. A Norman was't?
  King. A Norman.
  Laer. Upon my life, Lamound.
  King. Th
e very same.
  Laer. I know him well. He is the broach indeed
    And gem of all the nation.
  Ki
ng. He made confession of you;
    And gave you such a masterly report
    For art and exercise in
 your defence,
    And for your rapier most especially,
    That he cried out 'twould be a sight i
ndeed
    If one could match you. The scrimers of their nation
    He swore had neither motion, gu
ard, nor eye,
    If you oppos'd them. Sir, this report of his
    Did Hamlet so envenom with his 
envy
    That he could nothing do but wish and beg
    Your sudden coming o'er to play with you.

    Now, out of this-
  Laer. What out of this, my lord?
  King. Laertes, was your father dear to 
you?
    Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
    A face without a heart,'
  Laer. Why ask y
ou this?
  King. Not that I think you did not love your father;
    But that I know love is begun 
by time,
    And that I see, in passages of proof,
    Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
 
   There lives within the very flame of love
    A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
    A
nd nothing is at a like goodness still;
    For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
    Dies in his ow
n too-much. That we would do,
    We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes,
    And ha
th abatements and delays as many
    As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
    And then 
this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
    That hurts by easing. But to the quick o' th' ulcer!

    Hamlet comes back. What would you undertake
    To show yourself your father's son in deed
  
  More than in words?
  Laer. To cut his throat i' th' church!
  King. No place indeed should murt
her sanctuarize;
    Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,
    Will you do this? Keep 
close within your chamber.
    Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home.
    We'll put on thos
e shall praise your excellence
    And set a double varnish on the fame
    The Frenchman gave you
; bring you in fine together
    And wager on your heads. He, being remiss,
    Most generous, and
 free from all contriving,
    Will not peruse the foils; so that with ease,
    Or with a little 
shuffling, you may choose
    A sword unbated, and, in a pass of practice,
    Requite him for you
r father.
  Laer. I will do't!
    And for that purpose I'll anoint my sword.
    I bought an unc
tion of a mountebank,
    So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
    Where it draws blood no catap
lasm so rare,
    Collected from all simples that have virtue
    Under the moon, can save the thi
ng from death
    This is but scratch'd withal. I'll touch my point
    With this contagion, that,
 if I gall him slightly,
    It may be death.
  King. Let's further think of this,
    Weigh what
 convenience both of time and means
    May fit us to our shape. If this should fall,
    And that
 our drift look through our bad performance.
    'Twere better not assay'd. Therefore this project

    Should have a back or second, that might hold
    If this did blast in proof. Soft! let me see
.
    We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings-
    I ha't!
    When in your motion you are hot
 and dry-
    As make your bouts more violent to that end-
    And that he calls for drink, I'll h
ave prepar'd him
    A chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,
    If he by chance escape your
 venom'd stuck,
    Our purpose may hold there.- But stay, what noise,

                         
  Enter Queen.

    How now, sweet queen?
  Queen. One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
    S
o fast they follow. Your sister's drown'd, Laertes.
  Laer. Drown'd! O, where?
  Queen. There is a
 willow grows aslant a brook,
    That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream.
    There with 
fantastic garlands did she come
    Of crowflowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,
    That l
iberal shepherds give a grosser name,
    But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them.
    
There on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds
    Clamb'ring to hang, an envious sliver broke,
   
 When down her weedy trophies and herself
    Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide
 
   And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up;
    Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes,

    As one incapable of her own distress,
    Or like a creature native and indued
    Unto that e
lement; but long it could not be
    Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
    Pull'd th
e poor wretch from her melodious lay
    To muddy death.
  Laer. Alas, then she is drown'd?
  Que
en. Drown'd, drown'd.
  Laer. Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
    And therefore I forbi
d my tears; but yet
    It is our trick; nature her custom holds,
    Let shame say what it will. 
When these are gone,
    The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord.
    I have a speech of fire, that 
fain would blaze
    But that this folly douts it.                          Exit.
  King. Let's fo
llow, Gertrude.
    How much I had to do to calm his rage I
    Now fear I this will give it start
 again;
    Therefore let's follow.
                                                         Exeun

ACT V. Scene I.
Elsinore. A churchyard.

Enter two Clowns, [with spades a
nd pickaxes].

  Clown. Is she to be buried in Christian burial when she
wilfully
    seeks her 
own salvation?
  Other. I tell thee she is; therefore make her grave straight.
    The crowner hat
h sate on her, and finds it Christian burial.
  Clown. How can that be, unless she drown'd herself 
in her own
    defence?
  Other. Why, 'tis found so.
  Clown. It must be se offendendo; it cannot
 be else. For here
lies
    the point: if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act; and
an
   
 act hath three branches-it is to act, to do, and to perform;
    argal, she drown'd herself wittin
gly.
  Other. Nay, but hear you, Goodman Delver!
  Clown. Give me leave. Here lies the water; good
. Here stands
the
    man; good. If the man go to this water and drown himself, it
is,
    will 
he nill he, he goes- mark you that. But if the water
come to
    him and drown him, he drowns not 
himself. Argal, he that is
not
    guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.
  Other. Bu
t is this law?
  Clown. Ay, marry, is't- crowner's quest law.
  Other. Will you ha' the truth an't
? If this had not been a
    gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o' Christian
burial.
  
Clown. Why, there thou say'st! And the more pity that great
folk
    should have count'nance in th
is world to drown or hang
themselves
    more than their even-Christian. Come, my spade! There is 
no
    ancient gentlemen but gard'ners, ditchers, and grave-makers.
They
    hold up Adam's profe
ssion.
  Other. Was he a gentleman?
  Clown. 'A was the first that ever bore arms.
  Other. Why, 
he had none.
  Clown. What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the
Scripture?
    The Script
ure says Adam digg'd. Could he dig without arms?
I'll
    put another question to thee. If thou an
swerest me not to the
    purpose, confess thyself-
  Other. Go to!
  Clown. What is he that buil
ds stronger than either the mason,
the
    shipwright, or the carpenter?
  Other. The gallows-mak
er; for that frame outlives a thousand
    tenants.
  Clown. I like thy wit well, in good faith. T
he gallows does
well.
    But how does it well? It does well to those that do ill. Now,
    thou 
dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the
    church. Argal, the gallows may do well t
o thee. To't again,
come!
  Other. Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a
    carpe
nter?
  Clown. Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
  Other. Marry, now I can tell!
  Clown. To't.
  Ot
her. Mass, I cannot tell.

                 Enter Hamlet and Horatio afar off.

  Clown. Cudgel 
thy brains no more about it, for your dull ass
will
    not mend his pace with beating; and when y
ou are ask'd this
    question next, say 'a grave-maker.' The houses he makes lasts
    till dooms
day. Go, get thee to Yaughan; fetch me a stoup of
    liquor.
                                    
        [Exit Second Clown.]


                       [Clown digs and] sings.

       In youth 
when I did love, did love,
         Methought it was very sweet;
       To contract- O- the time f
or- a- my behove,
         O, methought there- a- was nothing- a- meet.

  Ham. Has this fellow n
o feeling of his business, that he sings
at
    grave-making?
  Hor. Custom hath made it in him a
 property of easiness.
  Ham. 'Tis e'en so. The hand of little employment hath the
daintier
    s
ense.
  Clown. (sings)
         But age with his stealing steps
           Hath clawed me in his 
clutch,
         And hath shipped me intil the land,
           As if I had never been such.
    
                                        [Throws up a skull.]

  Ham. That skull had a tongue in it
, and could sing once. How
the
    knave jowls it to the ground,as if 'twere Cain's jawbone,
that

    did the first murther! This might be the pate of a
Politician,
    which this ass now o'erre
aches; one that would circumvent
God,
    might it not?
  Hor. It might, my lord.
  Ham. Or of a
 courtier, which could say 'Good morrow, sweet
lord!
    How dost thou, good lord?' This might be 
my Lord Such-a-one,
that
    prais'd my Lord Such-a-one's horse when he meant to beg it-
might
 
   it not?
  Hor. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Why, e'en so! and now my Lady Worm's, chapless, and
knock'd

    about the mazzard with a sexton's spade. Here's fine
revolution,
    and we had the trick to
 see't. Did these bones cost no more
the
    breeding but to play at loggets with 'em? Mine ache t
o think
    on't.
  Clown. (Sings)
         A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,
           For and a
 shrouding sheet;
         O, a Pit of clay for to be made
           For such a guest is meet.
 
                                     Throws up [another skull].

  Ham. There's another. Why may n
ot that be the skull of a
lawyer?
    Where be his quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, his
ten
ures,
    and his tricks? Why does he suffer this rude knave now to
knock
    him about the sconc
e with a dirty shovel, and will not tell
him
    of his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might 
be in's time
a
    great buyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizances,
his
    fines, his
 double vouchers, his recoveries. Is this the fine
of
    his fines, and the recovery of his recov
eries, to have his
fine
    pate full of fine dirt? Will his vouchers vouch him no more
of
    h
is purchases, and double ones too, than the length and
breadth
    of a pair of indentures? The ve
ry conveyances of his lands
will
    scarcely lie in this box; and must th' inheritor himself have

no
    more, ha?
  Hor. Not a jot more, my lord.
  Ham. Is not parchment made of sheepskins?
 
 Hor. Ay, my lord, And of calveskins too.
  Ham. They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance
 in
that. I
    will speak to this fellow. Whose grave's this, sirrah?
  Clown. Mine, sir.

   
 [Sings] O, a pit of clay for to be made
              For such a guest is meet.

  Ham. I think 
it be thine indeed, for thou liest in't.
  Clown. You lie out on't, sir, and therefore 'tis not you
rs.
    For my part, I do not lie in't, yet it is mine.
  Ham. Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and 
say it is thine. 'Tis
for
    the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.
  Clown. 'Tis a 
quick lie, sir; 'twill away again from me to you.
  Ham. What man dost thou dig it for?
  Clown. F
or no man, sir.
  Ham. What woman then?
  Clown. For none neither.
  Ham. Who is to be buried in'
t?
  Clown. One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's
dead.
  Ham. How absolute the kn
ave is! We must speak by the card, or
    equivocation will undo us. By the Lord, Horatio, this thr
ee
years
    I have taken note of it, the age is grown so picked that the
toe
    of the peasant
 comes so near the heel of the courtier he
galls
    his kibe.- How long hast thou been a grave-ma
ker?
  Clown. Of all the days i' th' year, I came to't that day that
our
    last king Hamlet ove
rcame Fortinbras.
  Ham. How long is that since?
  Clown. Cannot you tell that? Every fool can tel
l that. It was
the
    very day that young Hamlet was born- he that is mad, and sent
    into Eng
land.
  Ham. Ay, marry, why was be sent into England?
  Clown. Why, because 'a was mad. 'A shall r
ecover his wits
there;
    or, if 'a do not, 'tis no great matter there.
  Ham. Why?
  Clown. 'T
will not he seen in him there. There the men are as
mad as
    he.
  Ham. How came he mad?
  Clo
wn. Very strangely, they say.
  Ham. How strangely?
  Clown. Faith, e'en with losing his wits.
  
Ham. Upon what ground?
  Clown. Why, here in Denmark. I have been sexton here, man and
boy
    th
irty years.
  Ham. How long will a man lie i' th' earth ere he rot?
  Clown. Faith, if 'a be not r
otten before 'a die (as we have
many
    pocky corses now-a-days that will scarce hold the laying 
in,
I
    will last you some eight year or nine year. A tanner will
last
    you nine year.
  H
am. Why he more than another?
  Clown. Why, sir, his hide is so tann'd with his trade that 'a
will

    keep out water a great while; and your water is a sore
decayer of
    your whoreson dead bod
y. Here's a skull now. This skull hath
lien
    you i' th' earth three-and-twenty years.
  Ham. W
hose was it?
  Clown. A whoreson, mad fellow's it was. Whose do you think it
was?
  Ham. Nay, I k
now not.
  Clown. A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! 'A pour'd a flagon
of
    Rhenish on my he
ad once. This same skull, sir, was Yorick's
    skull, the King's jester.
  Ham. This?
  Clown. E
'en that.
  Ham. Let me see. [Takes the skull.] Alas, poor Yorick! I knew
him,
    Horatio. A fel
low of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy.
He
    hath borne me on his back a thousand times. 
And now how
abhorred
    in my imagination it is! My gorge rises at it. Here hung
those
    lips
 that I have kiss'd I know not how oft. Where be your
gibes
    now? your gambols? your songs? you
r flashes of merriment that
    were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock
your
 
   own grinning? Quite chap- fall'n? Now get you to my lady's
    chamber, and tell her, let her pa
int an inch thick, to this
    favour she must come. Make her laugh at that. Prithee,
Horatio,
  
  tell me one thing.
  Hor. What's that, my lord?
  Ham. Dost thou think Alexander look'd o' this 
fashion i' th'
earth?
  Hor. E'en so.
  Ham. And smelt so? Pah!
                                
          [Puts down the skull.]
  Hor. E'en so, my lord.
  Ham. To what base uses we may return, 
Horatio! Why may not
    imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it
    stoppin
g a bunghole?
  Hor. 'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.
  Ham. No, faith, not a jot
; but to follow him thither with
modesty
    enough, and likelihood to lead it; as thus: Alexander
 died,
    Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust
is
    earth; of earth w
e make loam; and why of that loam (whereto
he
    was converted) might they not stop a beer barrel
?
    Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
    Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.
   
 O, that that earth which kept the world in awe
    Should patch a wall t' expel the winter's flaw!

    But soft! but soft! aside! Here comes the King-

    Enter [priests with] a coffin [in funer
al procession], King,
             Queen, Laertes, with Lords attendant.]

    The Queen, the cou
rtiers. Who is this they follow?
    And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken
    The corse t
hey follow did with desp'rate hand
    Fordo it own life. 'Twas of some estate.
    Couch we awhil
e, and mark.
                                         [Retires with Horatio.]

  Laer. What cerem
ony else?
  Ham. That is Laertes,
    A very noble youth. Mark.
  Laer. What ceremony else?
  Pr
iest. Her obsequies have been as far enlarg'd
    As we have warranty. Her death was doubtful;
   
 And, but that great command o'ersways the order,
    She should in ground unsanctified have lodg'd

    Till the last trumpet. For charitable prayers,
    Shards, flints, and pebbles should be thro
wn on her.
    Yet here she is allow'd her virgin rites,
    Her maiden strewments, and the bringi
ng home
    Of bell and burial.
  Laer. Must there no more be done?
  Priest. No more be done.
 
   We should profane the service of the dead
    To sing a requiem and such rest to her
    As to 
peace-parted souls.
  Laer. Lay her i' th' earth;
    And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
    
May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,
    A minist'ring angel shall my sister be
    W
hen thou liest howling.
  Ham. What, the fair Ophelia?
  Queen. Sweets to the sweet! Farewell.
  
                                           [Scatters flowers.]
    I hop'd thou shouldst have been 
my Hamlet's wife;
    I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
    And not have strew'd
 thy grave.
  Laer. O, treble woe
    Fall ten times treble on that cursed head
    Whose wicked 
deed thy most ingenious sense
    Depriv'd thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,
    Till I have cau
ght her once more in mine arms.
                                             Leaps in the grave.
 
   Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead
    Till of this flat a mountain you have made
    T
' o'ertop old Pelion or the skyish head
    Of blue Olympus.
  Ham. [comes forward] What is he who
se grief
    Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow
    Conjures the wand'ring stars, and 
makes them stand
    Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,
    Hamlet the Dane.                 
   [Leaps in after Laertes.
  Laer. The devil take thy soul!
                                     
       [Grapples with him].
  Ham. Thou pray'st not well.
    I prithee take thy fingers from my t
hroat;
    For, though I am not splenitive and rash,
    Yet have I in me something dangerous,
  
  Which let thy wisdom fear. Hold off thy hand!
  King. Pluck them asunder.
  Queen. Hamlet, Hamle
t!
  All. Gentlemen!
  Hor. Good my lord, be quiet.
             [The Attendants part them, and t
hey come out of the
                                                         grave.]
  Ham. Why, I
 will fight with him upon this theme
    Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
  Queen. O my son, w
hat theme?
  Ham. I lov'd Ophelia. Forty thousand brothers
    Could not (with all their quantity 
of love)
    Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?
  King. O, he is mad, Laertes.
  Queen. F
or love of God, forbear him!
  Ham. 'Swounds, show me what thou't do.
    Woo't weep? woo't fight?
 woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?
    Woo't drink up esill? eat a crocodile?
    I'll do't. Dost th
ou come here to whine?
    To outface me with leaping in her grave?
    Be buried quick with her, 
and so will I.
    And if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
    Millions of acres on us, til
l our ground,
    Singeing his pate against the burning zone,
    Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an t
hou'lt mouth,
    I'll rant as well as thou.
  Queen. This is mere madness;
    And thus a while 
the fit will work on him.
    Anon, as patient as the female dove
    When that her golden couplet
s are disclos'd,
    His silence will sit drooping.
  Ham. Hear you, sir!
    What is the reason 
that you use me thus?
    I lov'd you ever. But it is no matter.
    Let Hercules himself do what 
he may,
    The cat will mew, and dog will have his day.
Exit.
  King. I pray thee, good Horatio,
 wait upon him.
                                                   Exit Horatio.
    [To Laertes] 
Strengthen your patience in our last night's
speech.
    We'll put the matter to the present push.
-
    Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.-
    This grave shall have a living monument.

    An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
    Till then in patience our proceeding be.
          
                                               Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A hall in the C
astle.

Enter Hamlet and Horatio.

  Ham. So much for this, sir; now shall you see the other.
 
   You do remember all the circumstance?
  Hor. Remember it, my lord!
  Ham. Sir, in my heart ther
e was a kind of fighting
    That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay
    Worse than the mutin
ies in the bilboes. Rashly-
    And prais'd be rashness for it; let us know,
    Our indiscretion 
sometime serves us well
    When our deep plots do pall; and that should learn us
    There's a di
vinity that shapes our ends,
    Rough-hew them how we will-
  Hor. That is most certain.
  Ham. 
Up from my cabin,
    My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
    Grop'd I to find out them; had
 my desire,
    Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew
    To mine own room again; making so 
bold
    (My fears forgetting manners) to unseal
    Their grand commission; where I found, Horati
o
    (O royal knavery!), an exact command,
    Larded with many several sorts of reasons,
    Im
porting Denmark's health, and England's too,
    With, hoo! such bugs and goblins in my life-
    
That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
    No, not to stay the finding of the axe,
    My head 
should be struck off.
  Hor. Is't possible?
  Ham. Here's the commission; read it at more leisure.

    But wilt thou bear me how I did proceed?
  Hor. I beseech you.
  Ham. Being thus benetted ro
und with villanies,
    Or I could make a prologue to my brains,
    They had begun the play. I sa
t me down;
    Devis'd a new commission; wrote it fair.
    I once did hold it, as our statists do
,
    A baseness to write fair, and labour'd much
    How to forget that learning; but, sir, now

    It did me yeoman's service. Wilt thou know
    Th' effect of what I wrote?
  Hor. Ay, good my 
lord.
  Ham. An earnest conjuration from the King,
    As England was his faithful tributary,
   
 As love between them like the palm might flourish,
    As peace should still her wheaten garland w
ear
    And stand a comma 'tween their amities,
    And many such-like as's of great charge,
    
That, on the view and knowing of these contents,
    Without debatement further, more or less,
   
 He should the bearers put to sudden death,
    Not shriving time allow'd.
  Hor. How was this sea
l'd?
  Ham. Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
    I had my father's signet in my purse,
    
Which was the model of that Danish seal;
    Folded the writ up in the form of th' other,
    Subs
crib'd it, gave't th' impression, plac'd it safely,
    The changeling never known. Now, the next d
ay
    Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent
    Thou know'st already.
  Hor. So Guilde
nstern and Rosencrantz go to't.
  Ham. Why, man, they did make love to this employment!
    They a
re not near my conscience; their defeat
    Does by their own insinuation grow.
    'Tis dangerous
 when the baser nature comes
    Between the pass and fell incensed points
    Of mighty opposites
.
  Hor. Why, what a king is this!
  Ham. Does it not, thinks't thee, stand me now upon-
    He t
hat hath kill'd my king, and whor'd my mother;
    Popp'd in between th' election and my hopes;
  
  Thrown out his angle for my proper life,
    And with such coz'nage- is't not perfect conscience

    To quit him with this arm? And is't not to be damn'd
    To let this canker of our nature come

    In further evil?
  Hor. It must be shortly known to him from England
    What is the issue o
f the business there.
  Ham. It will be short; the interim is mine,
    And a man's life is no mor
e than to say 'one.'
    But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
    That to Laertes I forgot myself,

    For by the image of my cause I see
    The portraiture of his. I'll court his favours.
    But
 sure the bravery of his grief did put me
    Into a tow'ring passion.
  Hor. Peace! Who comes her
e?

                 Enter young Osric, a courtier.

  Osr. Your lordship is right welcome back 
to Denmark.
  Ham. I humbly thank you, sir. [Aside to Horatio] Dost know this
    waterfly?
  Hor
. [aside to Hamlet] No, my good lord.
  Ham. [aside to Horatio] Thy state is the more gracious; for

'tis a
    vice to know him. He hath much land, and fertile. Let a beast
be
    lord of beasts,
 and his crib shall stand at the king's mess.
'Tis
    a chough; but, as I say, spacious in the po
ssession of dirt.

  Osr. Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should
impart
    a th
ing to you from his Majesty.
  Ham. I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit. Put
your

    bonnet to his right use. 'Tis for the head.
  Osr. I thank your lordship, it is very hot.
  
Ham. No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly.
  Osr. It is indifferent cold, my lord,
 indeed.
  Ham. But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my
complexion.
  Osr. Exceedingly,
 my lord; it is very sultry, as 'twere- I
cannot
    tell how. But, my lord, his Majesty bade me s
ignify to you
that
    he has laid a great wager on your head. Sir, this is the
matter-
  Ham. I
 beseech you remember.
                           [Hamlet moves him to put on his hat.]
  Osr. Nay
, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here
is
    newly come to court Laertes; believ
e me, an absolute
gentleman,
    full of most excellent differences, of very soft society and
   
 great showing. Indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the
card
    or calendar of gentry; for y
ou shall find in him the
continent of
    what part a gentleman would see.
  Ham. Sir, his define
ment suffers no perdition in you; though, I

    know, to divide him inventorially would dozy th' 
arithmetic
of
    memory, and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail.
    But, in the v
erity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of
great
    article, and his infusion of such dearth 
and rareness as, to
make
    true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror, and who
else
    
would trace him, his umbrage, nothing more.
  Osr. Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
  
Ham. The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our
more
    rawer breath?
  Osr. Sir?

  Hor [aside to Hamlet] Is't not possible to understand in
another
    tongue? You will do't, si
r, really.
  Ham. What imports the nomination of this gentleman?
  Osr. Of Laertes?
  Hor. [aside
] His purse is empty already. All's golden words are
    spent.
  Ham. Of him, sir.
  Osr. I know
 you are not ignorant-
  Ham. I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would
not
    m
uch approve me. Well, sir?
  Osr. You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is-
  Ham. I dar
e not confess that, lest I should compare with him in
    excellence; but to know a man well were t
o know himself.
  Osr. I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on
him
    by them
, in his meed he's unfellowed.
  Ham. What's his weapon?
  Osr. Rapier and dagger.
  Ham. That's 
two of his weapons- but well.
  Osr. The King, sir, hath wager'd with him six Barbary horses;
    
against the which he has impon'd, as I take it, six French
    rapiers and poniards, with their ass
igns, as girdle, hangers,
and
    so. Three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy,
 
   very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of
    very liberal conceit.
  Ham. 
What call you the carriages?
  Hor. [aside to Hamlet] I knew you must be edified by the
margent
 
   ere you had done.
  Osr. The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
  Ham. The phrase would be more g
ermane to the matter if we could
    carry cannon by our sides. I would it might be hangers till
t
hen.
    But on! Six Barbary horses against six French swords, their
    assigns, and three libera
l-conceited carriages: that's the
French
    bet against the Danish. Why is this all impon'd, as y
ou call
it?
  Osr. The King, sir, hath laid that, in a dozen passes between
    yourself and him,
 he shall not exceed you three hits; he hath
    laid on twelve for nine, and it would come to imme
diate trial
    if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.
  Ham. How if I answer no?
  Osr. I 
mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
  Ham. Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If
 it please his
Majesty,
    it is the breathing time of day with me. Let the foils be
    brought
, the gentleman willing, and the King hold his
purpose,
    I will win for him if I can; if not, I
 will gain nothing but
my
    shame and the odd hits.
  Osr. Shall I redeliver you e'en so?
  Ha
m. To this effect, sir, after what flourish your nature will.
  Osr. I commend my duty to your lord
ship.
  Ham. Yours, yours. [Exit Osric.] He does well to commend it
    himself; there are no tong
ues else for's turn.
  Hor. This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.
  Ham. He did compl
y with his dug before he suck'd it. Thus has
he,
    and many more of the same bevy that I know th
e drossy age
dotes
    on, only got the tune of the time and outward habit of
encounter-
    a k
ind of yesty collection, which carries them through and
    through the most fann'd and winnowed op
inions; and do but
blow
    them to their trial-the bubbles are out,

                          
  Enter a Lord.

  Lord. My lord, his Majesty commended him to you by young Osric,
who
    bring
s back to him, that you attend him in the hall. He sends
to
    know if your pleasure hold to play
 with Laertes, or that you
will
    take longer time.
  Ham. I am constant to my purposes; they f
ollow the King's
pleasure.
    If his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or whensoever,
provided

    I be so able as now.
  Lord. The King and Queen and all are coming down.
  Ham. In happy time
.
  Lord. The Queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to
    Laertes before you fall to
 play.
  Ham. She well instructs me.
                                                    [Exit Lor
d.]
  Hor. You will lose this wager, my lord.
  Ham. I do not think so. Since he went into France 
I have been
in
    continual practice. I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst
not
    think h
ow ill all's here about my heart. But it is no matter.
  Hor. Nay, good my lord -
  Ham. It is but
 foolery; but it is such a kind of gaingiving as
    would perhaps trouble a woman.
  Hor. If your
 mind dislike anything, obey it. I will forestall
their
    repair hither and say you are not fit.

  Ham. Not a whit, we defy augury; there's a special providence
in
    the fall of a sparrow. If
 it be now, 'tis not to come; if it
be
    not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it w
ill
come:
    the readiness is all. Since no man knows aught of what he
leaves,
    what is't to
 leave betimes? Let be.

    Enter King, Queen, Laertes, Osric, and Lords, with other
           
   Attendants with foils and gauntlets.
               A table and flagons of wine on it.

  King
. Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
                    [The King puts Laertes' hand 
into Hamlet's.]
  Ham. Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong;
    But pardon't, as you a
re a gentleman.
    This presence knows,
    And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd
   
 With sore distraction. What I have done
    That might your nature, honour, and exception
    Rou
ghly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
    Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet.
    If Ha
mlet from himself be taken away,
    And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
    Then Hamlet
 does it not, Hamlet denies it.
    Who does it, then? His madness. If't be so,
    Hamlet is of t
he faction that is wrong'd;
    His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
    Sir, in this audience,
  
  Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd evil
    Free me so far in your most generous thoughts
    Th
at I have shot my arrow o'er the house
    And hurt my brother.
  Laer. I am satisfied in nature,

    Whose motive in this case should stir me most
    To my revenge. But in my terms of honour
  
  I stand aloof, and will no reconcilement
    Till by some elder masters of known honour
    I ha
ve a voice and precedent of peace
    To keep my name ungor'd. But till that time
    I do receive
 your offer'd love like love,
    And will not wrong it.
  Ham. I embrace it freely,
    And will
 this brother's wager frankly play.
    Give us the foils. Come on.
  Laer. Come, one for me.
  H
am. I'll be your foil, Laertes. In mine ignorance
    Your skill shall, like a star i' th' darkest 
night,
    Stick fiery off indeed.
  Laer. You mock me, sir.
  Ham. No, by this hand.
  King. Gi
ve them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
    You know the wager?
  Ham. Very well, my lord.

    Your Grace has laid the odds o' th' weaker side.
  King. I do not fear it, I have seen you bot
h;
    But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.
  Laer. This is too heavy; let me see ano
ther.
  Ham. This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
                                  
              Prepare to play.
  Osr. Ay, my good lord.
  King. Set me the stoups of wine upon tha
t table.
    If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
    Or quit in answer of the third exchange,

    Let all the battlements their ordnance fire;
    The King shall drink to Hamlet's better breat
h,
    And in the cup an union shall he throw
    Richer than that which four successive kings
  
  In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;
    And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
   
 The trumpet to the cannoneer without,
    The cannons to the heavens, the heaven to earth,
    'N
ow the King drinks to Hamlet.' Come, begin.
    And you the judges, bear a wary eye.
  Ham. Come o
n, sir.
  Laer. Come, my lord.                                They play.
  Ham. One.
  Laer. No.

  Ham. Judgment!
  Osr. A hit, a very palpable hit.
  Laer. Well, again!
  King. Stay, give me d
rink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
    Here's to thy health.
               [Drum; trumpets sound;
 a piece goes off [within].
    Give him the cup.
  Ham. I'll play this bout first; set it by awhi
le.
    Come. (They play.) Another hit. What say you?
  Laer. A touch, a touch; I do confess't.
 
 King. Our son shall win.
  Queen. He's fat, and scant of breath.
    Here, Hamlet, take my napkin
, rub thy brows.
    The Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
  Ham. Good madam!
  King. Gertru
de, do not drink.
  Queen. I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.          Drinks.
  King. [aside]
 It is the poison'd cup; it is too late.
  Ham. I dare not drink yet, madam; by-and-by.
  Queen. C
ome, let me wipe thy face.
  Laer. My lord, I'll hit him now.
  King. I do not think't.
  Laer. [
aside] And yet it is almost against my conscience.
  Ham. Come for the third, Laertes! You but dall
y.
    Pray you pass with your best violence;
    I am afeard you make a wanton of me.
  Laer. Sa
y you so? Come on.                               Play.
  Osr. Nothing neither way.
  Laer. Have at
 you now!
                [Laertes wounds Hamlet; then] in scuffling, they
                    cha
nge rapiers, [and Hamlet wounds Laertes].
  King. Part them! They are incens'd.
  Ham. Nay come! a
gain!                         The Queen falls.

  Osr. Look to the Queen there, ho!
  Hor. They b
leed on both sides. How is it, my lord?
  Osr. How is't, Laertes?
  Laer. Why, as a woodcock to mi
ne own springe, Osric.
    I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.
  Ham. How does the Queen?

  King. She sounds to see them bleed.
  Queen. No, no! the drink, the drink! O my dear Hamlet!
  
  The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.                 [Dies.]
  Ham. O villany! Ho! let the door b
e lock'd.
    Treachery! Seek it out.
                                                [Laertes fal
ls.]
  Laer. It is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain;
    No medicine in the world can do thee 
good.
    In thee there is not half an hour of life.
    The treacherous instrument is in thy hand
,
    Unbated and envenom'd. The foul practice
    Hath turn'd itself on me. Lo, here I lie,
    
Never to rise again. Thy mother's poison'd.
    I can no more. The King, the King's to blame.
  Ha
m. The point envenom'd too?
    Then, venom, to thy work.                    Hurts the King.
  All
. Treason! treason!
  King. O, yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt.
  Ham. Here, thou incestuous
, murd'rous, damned Dane,
    Drink off this potion! Is thy union here?
    Follow my mother.     
                            King dies.
  Laer. He is justly serv'd.
    It is a poison temper'd by
 himself.
    Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet.
    Mine and my father's death come not 
upon thee,
    Nor thine on me!                                       Dies.
  Ham. Heaven make the
e free of it! I follow thee.
    I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!
    You that look pale
 and tremble at this chance,
    That are but mutes or audience to this act,
    Had I but time (a
s this fell sergeant, Death,
    Is strict in his arrest) O, I could tell you-
    But let it be. 
Horatio, I am dead;
    Thou liv'st; report me and my cause aright
    To the unsatisfied.
  Hor.
 Never believe it.
    I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.
    Here's yet some liquor left.
 
 Ham. As th'art a man,
    Give me the cup. Let go! By heaven, I'll ha't.
    O good Horatio, what
 a wounded name
    (Things standing thus unknown) shall live behind me!
    If thou didst ever ho
ld me in thy heart,
    Absent thee from felicity awhile,
    And in this harsh world draw thy bre
ath in pain,
    To tell my story.         [March afar off, and shot within.]
    What warlike noi
se is this?
  Osr. Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
    To the ambassadors of Eng
land gives
    This warlike volley.
  Ham. O, I die, Horatio!
    The potent poison quite o'ercro
ws my spirit.
    I cannot live to hear the news from England,
    But I do prophesy th' election 
lights
    On Fortinbras. He has my dying voice.
    So tell him, with th' occurrents, more and le
ss,
    Which have solicited- the rest is silence.             Dies.
  Hor. Now cracks a noble hea
rt. Good night, sweet prince,
    And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
                   
                              [March within.]
    Why does the drum come hither?

    Enter Forti
nbras and English Ambassadors, with Drum,
                  Colours, and Attendants.

  Fort. Whe
re is this sight?
  Hor. What is it you will see?
    If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search
.
  Fort. This quarry cries on havoc. O proud Death,
    What feast is toward in thine eternal cel
l
    That thou so many princes at a shot
    So bloodily hast struck.
  Ambassador. The sight is
 dismal;
    And our affairs from England come too late.
    The ears are senseless that should gi
ve us hearing
    To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd
    That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern a
re dead.
    Where should we have our thanks?
  Hor. Not from his mouth,
    Had it th' ability o
f life to thank you.
    He never gave commandment for their death.
    But since, so jump upon th
is bloody question,
    You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
    Are here arriv'd, give
 order that these bodies
    High on a stage be placed to the view;
    And let me speak to the ye
t unknowing world
    How these things came about. So shall you hear
    Of carnal, bloody and unn
atural acts;
    Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters;
    Of deaths put on by cunning and f
orc'd cause;
    And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
    Fall'n on th' inventors' heads. All thi
s can I
    Truly deliver.
  Fort. Let us haste to hear it,
    And call the noblest to the audie
nce.
    For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.
    I have some rights of memory in this kingdo
m
    Which now, to claim my vantage doth invite me.
  Hor. Of that I shall have also cause to spe
ak,
    And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more.
    But let this same be presently perfo
rm'd,
    Even while men's minds are wild, lest more mischance
    On plots and errors happen.
  
Fort. Let four captains
    Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage;
    For he was likely, had he
 been put on,
    To have prov'd most royally; and for his passage
    The soldiers' music and the
 rites of war
    Speak loudly for him.
    Take up the bodies. Such a sight as this
    Becomes 
the field but here shows much amiss.
    Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
            Exeunt marching; 
after the which a peal of ordnance
                                                   are shot off.

ACT I. Scene I.
Elsinore. A platform befo
re the Castle.

Enter two Sentinels-[first,] Francisco, [who paces up and down
at his post; then]
 Bernardo, [who approaches him].

  Ber. Who's there?
  Fran. Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yo
urself.
  Ber. Long live the King!
  Fran. Bernardo?
  Ber. He.
  Fran. You come most carefully 
upon your hour.
  Ber. 'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.
  Fran. For this relief
 much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold,
    And I am sick at heart.
  Ber. Have you had quiet guard?
  Fr
an. Not a mouse stirring.
  Ber. Well, good night.
    If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
    
The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.

                    Enter Horatio and Marcellus.


  Fran. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?
  Hor. Friends to this ground.
  Mar. And li
egemen to the Dane.
  Fran. Give you good night.
  Mar. O, farewell, honest soldier.
    Who hath
 reliev'd you?
  Fran. Bernardo hath my place.
    Give you good night.                           
        Exit.
  Mar. Holla, Bernardo!
  Ber. Say-
    What, is Horatio there ?
  Hor. A piece of
 him.
  Ber. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.
  Mar. What, has this thing appear'd again
 to-night?
  Ber. I have seen nothing.
  Mar. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
    And will not
 let belief take hold of him
    Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.
    Therefore I ha
ve entreated him along,
    With us to watch the minutes of this night,
    That, if again this ap
parition come,
    He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
  Hor. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.

  Ber. Sit down awhile,
    And let us once again assail your ears,
    That are so fortified aga
inst our story,
    What we two nights have seen.
  Hor. Well, sit we down,
    And let us hear B
ernardo speak of this.
  Ber. Last night of all,
    When yond same star that's westward from the 
pole
    Had made his course t' illume that part of heaven
    Where now it burns, Marcellus and m
yself,
    The bell then beating one-

                        Enter Ghost.

  Mar. Peace! brea
k thee off! Look where it comes again!
  Ber. In the same figure, like the King that's dead.
  Mar
. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
  Ber. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.
 
 Hor. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.
  Ber. It would be spoke to.
  Mar. Question 
it, Horatio.
  Hor. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night
    Together with that fair and
 warlike form
    In which the majesty of buried Denmark
    Did sometimes march? By heaven I char
ge thee speak!
  Mar. It is offended.
  Ber. See, it stalks away!
  Hor. Stay! Speak, speak! I ch
arge thee speak!
                                                     Exit Ghost.
  Mar. 'Tis gone
 and will not answer.
  Ber. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale.
    Is not this somethin
g more than fantasy?
    What think you on't?
  Hor. Before my God, I might not this believe
    
Without the sensible and true avouch
    Of mine own eyes.
  Mar. Is it not like the King?
  Hor.
 As thou art to thyself.
    Such was the very armour he had on
    When he th' ambitious Norway c
ombated.
    So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,
    He smote the sledded Polacks on the i
ce.
    'Tis strange.
  Mar. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
    With martial stal
k hath he gone by our watch.
  Hor. In what particular thought to work I know not;
    But, in the
 gross and scope of my opinion,
    This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
  Mar. Good now
, sit down, and tell me he that knows,
    Why this same strict and most observant watch
    So ni
ghtly toils the subject of the land,
    And why such daily cast of brazen cannon
    And foreign 
mart for implements of war;
    Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
    Does not divi
de the Sunday from the week.
    What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
    Doth make the ni
ght joint-labourer with the day?
    Who is't that can inform me?
  Hor. That can I.
    At least
, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
    Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
    Was, as you
 know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
    Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
    Dar'd to the c
ombat; in which our valiant Hamlet
    (For so this side of our known world esteem'd him)
    Did 
slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,
    Well ratified by law and heraldry,
    Did for
feit, with his life, all those his lands
    Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror;
    Again
st the which a moiety competent
    Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
    To the inheritan
ce of Fortinbras,
    Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant
    And carriage of the art
icle design'd,
    His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
    Of unimproved mettle hot an
d full,
    Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,
    Shark'd up a list of lawless resolut
es,
    For food and diet, to some enterprise
    That hath a stomach in't; which is no other,
  
  As it doth well appear unto our state,
    But to recover of us, by strong hand
    And terms co
mpulsatory, those foresaid lands
    So by his father lost; and this, I take it,
    Is the main m
otive of our preparations,
    The source of this our watch, and the chief head
    Of this post-h
aste and romage in the land.
  Ber. I think it be no other but e'en so.
    Well may it sort that 
this portentous figure
    Comes armed through our watch, so like the King
    That was and is the
 question of these wars.
  Hor. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
    In the most high and p
almy state of Rome,
    A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
    The graves stood tenantless, a
nd the sheeted dead
    Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;
    As stars with trains of fi
re, and dews of blood,
    Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
    Upon whose influence Neptu
ne's empire stands
    Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.
    And even the like precurse of
 fierce events,
    As harbingers preceding still the fates
    And prologue to the omen coming on
,
    Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
    Unto our climature and countrymen.

      
                Enter Ghost again.

    But soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again!
    I'll cros
s it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!
                                               Spreads hi
s arms.
    If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
    Speak to me.
    If there be any good th
ing to be done,
    That may to thee do ease, and, race to me,
    Speak to me.
    If thou art p
rivy to thy country's fate,
    Which happily foreknowing may avoid,
    O, speak!
    Or if thou
 hast uphoarded in thy life
    Extorted treasure in the womb of earth
    (For which, they say, y
ou spirits oft walk in death),
                                                 The cock crows.
  
  Speak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!
  Mar. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?

  Hor. Do, if it will not stand.
  Ber. 'Tis here!
  Hor. 'Tis here!
  Mar. 'Tis gone!
        
                                             Exit Ghost.
    We do it wrong, being so majestical,

    To offer it the show of violence;
    For it is as the air, invulnerable,
    And our vain blo
ws malicious mockery.
  Ber. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
  Hor. And then it started
, like a guilty thing
    Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
    The cock, that is the trumpet t
o the morn,
    Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
    Awake the god of day; and at hi
s warning,
    Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
    Th' extravagant and erring spirit hies

    To his confine; and of the truth herein
    This present object made probation.
  Mar. It fa
ded on the crowing of the cock.
    Some say that ever, 'gainst that season comes
    Wherein our 
Saviour's birth is celebrated,
    The bird of dawning singeth all night long;
    And then, they 
say, no spirit dare stir abroad,
    The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,
    No fair
y takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
    So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
  Hor. So hav
e I heard and do in part believe it.
    But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
    Walks o'er
 the dew of yon high eastward hill.
    Break we our watch up; and by my advice
    Let us impart 
what we have seen to-night
    Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
    This spirit, dumb to us, 
will speak to him.
    Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
    As needful in our loves, 
fitting our duty?
    Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
    Where we shall find him most
 conveniently.           Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A room of state in the Castle.

Flo
urish. [Enter Claudius, King of Denmark, Gertrude the Queen,
Hamlet,
Polonius, Laertes and his sis
ter Ophelia, [Voltemand, Cornelius,]
Lords Attendant.

  King. Though yet of Hamlet our dear brot
her's death
    The memory be green, and that it us befitted
    To bear our hearts in grief, and 
our whole kingdom
    To be contracted in one brow of woe,
    Yet so far hath discretion fought w
ith nature
    That we with wisest sorrow think on him
    Together with remembrance of ourselves.

    Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
    Th' imperial jointress to this warlike stat
e,
    Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,
    With an auspicious, and a dropping eye,
    Wi
th mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,
    In equal scale weighing delight and dole,
   
 Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd
    Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
    With
 this affair along. For all, our thanks.
    Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
    Hol
ding a weak supposal of our worth,
    Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
    Our state 
to be disjoint and out of frame,
    Colleagued with this dream of his advantage,
    He hath not 
fail'd to pester us with message
    Importing the surrender of those lands
    Lost by his father
, with all bands of law,
    To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
    Now for ourself and
 for this time of meeting.
    Thus much the business is: we have here writ
    To Norway, uncle o
f young Fortinbras,
    Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears
    Of this his nephew's purpose,
 to suppress
    His further gait herein, in that the levies,
    The lists, and full proportions 
are all made
    Out of his subject; and we here dispatch
    You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltem
and,
    For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,
    Giving to you no further personal power

    To business with the King, more than the scope
    Of these dilated articles allow.            
[Gives a paper.]
    Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
  Cor., Volt. In that, and al
l things, will we show our duty.
  King. We doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell.
                 
                Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius.
    And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
  
  You told us of some suit. What is't, Laertes?
    You cannot speak of reason to the Dane
    And
 lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
    That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?

    The head is not more native to the heart,
    The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
    Tha
n is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
    What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
  Laer. My dread lo
rd,
    Your leave and favour to return to France;
    From whence though willingly I came to Denm
ark
    To show my duty in your coronation,
    Yet now I must confess, that duty done,
    My th
oughts and wishes bend again toward France
    And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
  K
ing. Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
  Pol. He hath, my lord, wrung from me my sl
ow leave
    By laboursome petition, and at last
    Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent.
    
I do beseech you give him leave to go.
  King. Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,
    And
 thy best graces spend it at thy will!
    But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son-
  Ham. [aside] A
 little more than kin, and less than kind!
  King. How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
  
Ham. Not so, my lord. I am too much i' th' sun.
  Queen. Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,

    And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
    Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
   
 Seek for thy noble father in the dust.
    Thou know'st 'tis common. All that lives must die,
   
 Passing through nature to eternity.
  Ham. Ay, madam, it is common.
  Queen. If it be,
    Why s
eems it so particular with thee?
  Ham. Seems, madam, Nay, it is. I know not 'seems.'
    'Tis not
 alone my inky cloak, good mother,
    Nor customary suits of solemn black,
    Nor windy suspirat
ion of forc'd breath,
    No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
    Nor the dejected havior of th
e visage,
    Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
    'That can denote me truly. Thes
e indeed seem,
    For they are actions that a man might play;
    But I have that within which pa
sseth show-
    These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
  King. 'Tis sweet and commendable i
n your nature, Hamlet,
    To give these mourning duties to your father;
    But you must know, yo
ur father lost a father;
    That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
    In filial obli
gation for some term
    To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever
    In obstinate condolement is 
a course
    Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief;
    It shows a will most incorrect to he
aven,
    A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
    An understanding simple and unschool'd;
    
For what we know must be, and is as common
    As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
    Why shou
ld we in our peevish opposition
    Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
    A fault aga
inst the dead, a fault to nature,
    To reason most absurd, whose common theme
    Is death of fa
thers, and who still hath cried,
    From the first corse till he that died to-day,
    'This must
 be so.' We pray you throw to earth
    This unprevailing woe, and think of us
    As of a father;
 for let the world take note
    You are the most immediate to our throne,
    And with no less no
bility of love
    Than that which dearest father bears his son
    Do I impart toward you. For yo
ur intent
    In going back to school in Wittenberg,
    It is most retrograde to our desire;
   
 And we beseech you, bend you to remain
    Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
    Our chie
fest courtier, cousin, and our son.
  Queen. Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.
    I pr
ay thee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.
  Ham. I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
  King.
 Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.
    Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come.
    This gentle a
nd unforc'd accord of Hamlet
    Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,
    No jocund health 
that Denmark drinks to-day
    But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
    And the King's r
ouse the heaven shall bruit again,
    Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.
                    
            Flourish. Exeunt all but Hamlet.
  Ham. O that this too too solid flesh would melt,
  
  Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!
    Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
    His canon 'ga
inst self-slaughter! O God! God!
    How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
    Seem to me all t
he uses of this world!
    Fie on't! ah, fie! 'Tis an unweeded garden
    That grows to seed; thin
gs rank and gross in nature
    Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
    But two months
 dead! Nay, not so much, not two.
    So excellent a king, that was to this
    Hyperion to a saty
r; so loving to my mother
    That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
    Visit her face too 
roughly. Heaven and earth!
    Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him
    As if increase of a
ppetite had grown
    By what it fed on; and yet, within a month-
    Let me not think on't! Frail
ty, thy name is woman!-
    A little month, or ere those shoes were old
    With which she followe
d my poor father's body
    Like Niobe, all tears- why she, even she
    (O God! a beast that want
s discourse of reason
    Would have mourn'd longer) married with my uncle;
    My father's brothe
r, but no more like my father
    Than I to Hercules. Within a month,
    Ere yet the salt of most
 unrighteous tears
    Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
    She married. O, most wicked s
peed, to post
    With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
    It is not, nor it cannot come to g
ood.
    But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue!

          Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and 
Bernardo.

  Hor. Hail to your lordship!
  Ham. I am glad to see you well.
    Horatio!- or I do
 forget myself.
  Hor. The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
  Ham. Sir, my good friend- 
I'll change that name with you.
    And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?
    Marcellus?
  
Mar. My good lord!
  Ham. I am very glad to see you.- [To Bernardo] Good even, sir.-

    But wha
t, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
  Hor. A truant disposition, good my lord.
  Ham. I would n
ot hear your enemy say so,
    Nor shall you do my ear that violence
    To make it truster of you
r own report
    Against yourself. I know you are no truant.
    But what is your affair in Elsino
re?
    We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
  Hor. My lord, I came to see your father's 
funeral.
  Ham. I prithee do not mock me, fellow student.
    I think it was to see my mother's we
dding.
  Hor. Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.
  Ham. Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral 
bak'd meats
    Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
    Would I had met my dearest foe i
n heaven
    Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
    My father- methinks I see my father.
  Hor
. O, where, my lord?
  Ham. In my mind's eye, Horatio.
  Hor. I saw him once. He was a goodly king
.
  Ham. He was a man, take him for all in all.
    I shall not look upon his like again.
  Hor. 
My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
  Ham. Saw? who?
  Hor. My lord, the King your father.
  
Ham. The King my father?
  Hor. Season your admiration for a while
    With an attent ear, till I 
may deliver
    Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
    This marvel to you.
  Ham. For God's lov
e let me hear!
  Hor. Two nights together had these gentlemen
    (Marcellus and Bernardo) on thei
r watch
    In the dead vast and middle of the night
    Been thus encount'red. A figure like your
 father,
    Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
    Appears before them and with solemn march
    
Goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walk'd
    By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
  
  Within his truncheon's length; whilst they distill'd
    Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
 
   Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
    In dreadful secrecy impart they did,
    And I 
with them the third night kept the watch;
    Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
    Form
 of the thing, each word made true and good,
    The apparition comes. I knew your father.
    The
se hands are not more like.
  Ham. But where was this?
  Mar. My lord, upon the platform where we 
watch'd.
  Ham. Did you not speak to it?
  Hor. My lord, I did;
    But answer made it none. Yet 
once methought
    It lifted up it head and did address
    Itself to motion, like as it would spe
ak;
    But even then the morning cock crew loud,
    And at the sound it shrunk in haste away
  
  And vanish'd from our sight.
  Ham. 'Tis very strange.
  Hor. As I do live, my honour'd lord, 't
is true;
    And we did think it writ down in our duty
    To let you know of it.
  Ham. Indeed, 
indeed, sirs. But this troubles me.
    Hold you the watch to-night?
  Both [Mar. and Ber.] We do,
 my lord.
  Ham. Arm'd, say you?
  Both. Arm'd, my lord.
  Ham. From top to toe?
  Both. My lord
, from head to foot.
  Ham. Then saw you not his face?
  Hor. O, yes, my lord! He wore his beaver 
up.
  Ham. What, look'd he frowningly.
  Hor. A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
  Ham. 
Pale or red?
  Hor. Nay, very pale.
  Ham. And fix'd his eyes upon you?
  Hor. Most constantly.

  Ham. I would I had been there.
  Hor. It would have much amaz'd you.
  Ham. Very like, very like
. Stay'd it long?
  Hor. While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
  Both. Longer, longe
r.
  Hor. Not when I saw't.
  Ham. His beard was grizzled- no?
  Hor. It was, as I have seen it i
n his life,
    A sable silver'd.
  Ham. I will watch to-night.
    Perchance 'twill walk again.

  Hor. I warr'nt it will.
  Ham. If it assume my noble father's person,
    I'll speak to it, tho
ugh hell itself should gape
    And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
    If you have hitherto
 conceal'd this sight,
    Let it be tenable in your silence still;
    And whatsoever else shall 
hap to-night,
    Give it an understanding but no tongue.
    I will requite your loves. So, fare 
you well.
    Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
    I'll visit you.
  All. Our duty to
 your honour.
  Ham. Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell.
                                       
 Exeunt [all but Hamlet].
    My father's spirit- in arms? All is not well.
    I doubt some foul 
play. Would the night were come!
    Till then sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,
    Thoug
h all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
Exit.




Scene III.
Elsinore. A room in the h
ouse of Polonius.

Enter Laertes and Ophelia.

  Laer. My necessaries are embark'd. Farewell.
 
   And, sister, as the winds give benefit
    And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
    But let m
e hear from you.
  Oph. Do you doubt that?
  Laer. For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,
  
  Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood;
    A violet in the youth of primy nature,
    Forward, n
ot permanent- sweet, not lasting;
    The perfume and suppliance of a minute;
    No more.
  Oph.
 No more but so?
  Laer. Think it no more.
    For nature crescent does not grow alone
    In the
ws and bulk; but as this temple waxes,
    The inward service of the mind and soul
    Grows wide 
withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
    And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
    The virtue of h
is will; but you must fear,
    His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
    For he himself
 is subject to his birth.
    He may not, as unvalued persons do,
    Carve for himself, for on hi
s choice depends
    The safety and health of this whole state,
    And therefore must his choice 
be circumscrib'd
    Unto the voice and yielding of that body
    Whereof he is the head. Then if 
he says he loves you,
    It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
    As he in his particular act
 and place
    May give his saying deed; which is no further
    Than the main voice of Denmark go
es withal.
    Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain
    If with too credent ear you list h
is songs,
    Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
    To his unmast'red importunity.

    Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
    And keep you in the rear of your affection,
  
  Out of the shot and danger of desire.
    The chariest maid is prodigal enough
    If she unmask
 her beauty to the moon.
    Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes.
    The canker galls the
 infants of the spring
    Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd,
    And in the morn and liqu
id dew of youth
    Contagious blastments are most imminent.
    Be wary then; best safety lies in
 fear.
    Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
  Oph. I shall th' effect of this good l
esson keep
    As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
    Do not as some ungracious pastor
s do,
    Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven,
    Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless liber
tine,
    Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads
    And recks not his own rede.
  Laer. O
, fear me not!

                       Enter Polonius.

    I stay too long. But here my father 
comes.
    A double blessing is a double grace;
    Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
  Pol. Y
et here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame!
    The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
    A
nd you are stay'd for. There- my blessing with thee!
    And these few precepts in thy memory
    
Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
    Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.
    
Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar:
    Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
 
   Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel;
    But do not dull thy palm with entertainment

    Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware
    Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,
  
  Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee.
    Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice;
   
 Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
    Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
   
 But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
    For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
    And t
hey in France of the best rank and station
    Are most select and generous, chief in that.
    Ne
ither a borrower nor a lender be;
    For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
    And borrowing
 dulls the edge of husbandry.
    This above all- to thine own self be true,
    And it must follo
w, as the night the day,
    Thou canst not then be false to any man.
    Farewell. My blessing se
ason this in thee!
  Laer. Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
  Pol. The time invites you. G
o, your servants tend.
  Laer. Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well
    What I have said to you.

  Oph. 'Tis in my memory lock'd,
    And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
  Laer. Farewell. 
                                         Exit.
  Pol. What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?
  O
ph. So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
  Pol. Marry, well bethought!
    'Tis told
 me he hath very oft of late
    Given private time to you, and you yourself
    Have of your audi
ence been most free and bounteous.
    If it be so- as so 'tis put on me,
    And that in way of c
aution- I must tell you
    You do not understand yourself so clearly
    As it behooves my daught
er and your honour.
    What is between you? Give me up the truth.
  Oph. He hath, my lord, of lat
e made many tenders
    Of his affection to me.
  Pol. Affection? Pooh! You speak like a green gir
l,
    Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
    Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?

  Oph. I do not know, my lord, what I should think,
  Pol. Marry, I will teach you! Think yourself 
a baby
    That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
    Which are not sterling. Tender your
self more dearly,
    Or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
    Running it thus) you'll te
nder me a fool.
  Oph. My lord, he hath importun'd me with love
    In honourable fashion.
  Pol.
 Ay, fashion you may call it. Go to, go to!
  Oph. And hath given countenance to his speech, my lor
d,
    With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
  Pol. Ay, springes to catch woodcocks! I do know,

    When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
    Lends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter
,
    Giving more light than heat, extinct in both
    Even in their promise, as it is a-making,

    You must not take for fire. From this time
    Be something scanter of your maiden presence.
 
   Set your entreatments at a higher rate
    Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
    Belie
ve so much in him, that he is young,
    And with a larger tether may he walk
    Than may be give
n you. In few, Ophelia,
    Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
    Not of that dye whi
ch their investments show,
    But mere implorators of unholy suits,
    Breathing like sanctified
 and pious bawds,
    The better to beguile. This is for all:
    I would not, in plain terms, fro
m this time forth
    Have you so slander any moment leisure
    As to give words or talk with the
 Lord Hamlet.
    Look to't, I charge you. Come your ways.
  Oph. I shall obey, my lord.
        
                                                 Exeunt.




Scene IV.
Elsinore. The platform 
before the Castle.

Enter Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus.

  Ham. The air bites shrewdly; it is 
very cold.
  Hor. It is a nipping and an eager air.
  Ham. What hour now?
  Hor. I think it lacks
 of twelve.
  Mar. No, it is struck.
  Hor. Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws near the season

    Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
                   A flourish of trumpets, and two p
ieces go off.
    What does this mean, my lord?
  Ham. The King doth wake to-night and takes his r
ouse,
    Keeps wassail, and the swagg'ring upspring reels,
    And, as he drains his draughts of 
Rhenish down,
    The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out
    The triumph of his pledge.
  Hor. 
Is it a custom?
  Ham. Ay, marry, is't;
    But to my mind, though I am native here
    And to th
e manner born, it is a custom
    More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
    This heavy-
headed revel east and west
    Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations;
    They clip us drun
kards and with swinish phrase
    Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
    From our achievements
, though perform'd at height,
    The pith and marrow of our attribute.
    So oft it chances in p
articular men
    That, for some vicious mole of nature in them,
    As in their birth,- wherein t
hey are not guilty,
    Since nature cannot choose his origin,-
    By the o'ergrowth of some comp
lexion,
    Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
    Or by some habit that too much o'
erleavens
    The form of plausive manners, that these men
    Carrying, I say, the stamp of one d
efect,
    Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,
    Their virtues else- be they as pure as gr
ace,
    As infinite as man may undergo-
    Shall in the general censure take corruption
    Fro
m that particular fault. The dram of e'il
    Doth all the noble substance often dout To his own sc
andal.

                         Enter Ghost.

  Hor. Look, my lord, it comes!
  Ham. Angels an
d ministers of grace defend us!
    Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
    Bring with th
ee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
    Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
    Thou com'st 
in such a questionable shape
    That I will speak to thee. I'll call thee Hamlet,
    King, fathe
r, royal Dane. O, answer me?
    Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell
    Why thy canoniz'd bon
es, hearsed in death,
    Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre
    Wherein we saw thee qu
ietly inurn'd,
    Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws
    To cast thee up again. What may thi
s mean
    That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,
    Revisits thus the glimpses of the m
oon,
    Making night hideous, and we fools of nature
    So horridly to shake our disposition
  
  With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
    Say, why is this? wherefore? What should we do
?
                                           Ghost beckons Hamlet.
  Hor. It beckons you to go awa
y with it,
    As if it some impartment did desire
    To you alone.
  Mar. Look with what courte
ous action
    It waves you to a more removed ground.
    But do not go with it!
  Hor. No, by no
 means!
  Ham. It will not speak. Then will I follow it.
  Hor. Do not, my lord!
  Ham. Why, what
 should be the fear?
    I do not set my life at a pin's fee;
    And for my soul, what can it do 
to that,
    Being a thing immortal as itself?
    It waves me forth again. I'll follow it.
  Hor
. What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
    Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
    T
hat beetles o'er his base into the sea,
    And there assume some other, horrible form
    Which m
ight deprive your sovereignty of reason
    And draw you into madness? Think of it.
    The very p
lace puts toys of desperation,
    Without more motive, into every brain
    That looks so many fa
doms to the sea
    And hears it roar beneath.
  Ham. It waves me still.
    Go on. I'll follow t
hee.
  Mar. You shall not go, my lord.
  Ham. Hold off your hands!
  Hor. Be rul'd. You shall not
 go.
  Ham. My fate cries out
    And makes each petty artire in this body
    As hardy as the Ne
mean lion's nerve.
                                                [Ghost beckons.]

    Still am
 I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
    By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!-
    I say,
 away!- Go on. I'll follow thee.
                                        Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet.

  Hor. He waxes desperate with imagination.
  Mar. Let's follow. 'Tis not fit thus to obey him.
  
Hor. Have after. To what issue will this come?
  Mar. Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.

  Hor. Heaven will direct it.
  Mar. Nay, let's follow him.
                                     
                    Exeunt.




Scene V.
Elsinore. The Castle. Another part of the fortificati
ons.

Enter Ghost and Hamlet.

  Ham. Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak! I'll go no further.
  G
host. Mark me.
  Ham. I will.
  Ghost. My hour is almost come,
    When I to sulph'rous and torme
nting flames
    Must render up myself.
  Ham. Alas, poor ghost!
  Ghost. Pity me not, but lend t
hy serious hearing
    To what I shall unfold.
  Ham. Speak. I am bound to hear.
  Ghost. So art 
thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
  Ham. What?
  Ghost. I am thy father's spirit,
    Doom'd
 for a certain term to walk the night,
    And for the day confin'd to fast in fires,
    Till the
 foul crimes done in my days of nature
    Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid
    To 
tell the secrets of my prison house,
    I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
    Would harro
w up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
    Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,

    Thy knotted and combined locks to part,
    And each particular hair to stand on end
    Lik
e quills upon the fretful porcupine.
    But this eternal blazon must not be
    To ears of flesh 
and blood. List, list, O, list!
    If thou didst ever thy dear father love-
  Ham. O God!
  Ghos
t. Revenge his foul and most unnatural murther.
  Ham. Murther?
  Ghost. Murther most foul, as in 
the best it is;
    But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.
  Ham. Haste me to know't, that I,
 with wings as swift
    As meditation or the thoughts of love,
    May sweep to my revenge.
  Gh
ost. I find thee apt;
    And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
    That rots itself in ea
se on Lethe wharf,
    Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.
    'Tis given out that, 
sleeping in my orchard,
    A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark
    Is by a forged pro
cess of my death
    Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth,
    The serpent that did sting thy
 father's life
    Now wears his crown.
  Ham. O my prophetic soul!
    My uncle?
  Ghost. Ay, t
hat incestuous, that adulterate beast,
    With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts-
    
O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
    So to seduce!- won to his shameful lust
    The wi
ll of my most seeming-virtuous queen.
    O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there,
    From me, who
se love was of that dignity
    That it went hand in hand even with the vow
    I made to her in m
arriage, and to decline
    Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
    To those of mine!
   
 But virtue, as it never will be mov'd,
    Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
    So 
lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
    Will sate itself in a celestial bed
    And prey on ga
rbage.
    But soft! methinks I scent the morning air.
    Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orc
hard,
    My custom always of the afternoon,
    Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
    With ju
ice of cursed hebona in a vial,
    And in the porches of my ears did pour
    The leperous distil
ment; whose effect
    Holds such an enmity with blood of man
    That swift as quicksilver it cou
rses through
    The natural gates and alleys of the body,
    And with a sudden vigour it doth po
sset
    And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
    The thin and wholesome blood. So did it min
e;
    And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
    Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust

    All my smooth body.
    Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
    Of life, of crown, of q
ueen, at once dispatch'd;
    Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
    Unhous'led, disappointed
, unanel'd,
    No reckoning made, but sent to my account
    With all my imperfections on my head
.
  Ham. O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
  Ghost. If thou hast nature in thee, bear it no
t.
    Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
    A couch for luxury and damned incest.
    But, how
soever thou pursuest this act,
    Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
    Against thy m
other aught. Leave her to heaven,
    And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge
    To prick and
 sting her. Fare thee well at once.
    The glowworm shows the matin to be near
    And gins to pa
le his uneffectual fire.
    Adieu, adieu, adieu! Remember me.                      Exit.

  Ham.
 O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?
    And shall I couple hell? Hold, hold, my heart!

    And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
    But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?
    Ay, t
hou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
    In this distracted globe. Remember thee?
    Yea, fr
om the table of my memory
    I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
    All saws of books, all 
forms, all pressures past
    That youth and observation copied there,
    And thy commandment all
 alone shall live
    Within the book and volume of my brain,
    Unmix'd with baser matter. Yes, 
by heaven!
    O most pernicious woman!
    O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
    My t
ables! Meet it is I set it down
    That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
    At least 
I am sure it may be so in Denmark.        [Writes.]
    So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word:

    It is 'Adieu, adieu! Remember me.'
    I have sworn't.
  Hor. (within) My lord, my lord!

  
                 Enter Horatio and Marcellus.

  Mar. Lord Hamlet!
  Hor. Heaven secure him!
  H
am. So be it!
  Mar. Illo, ho, ho, my lord!
  Ham. Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.
  Mar. H
ow is't, my noble lord?
  Hor. What news, my lord?
  Mar. O, wonderful!
  Hor. Good my lord, tell
 it.
  Ham. No, you will reveal it.
  Hor. Not I, my lord, by heaven!
  Mar. Nor I, my lord.
  H
am. How say you then? Would heart of man once think it?
    But you'll be secret?
  Both. Ay, by h
eaven, my lord.
  Ham. There's neer a villain dwelling in all Denmark
    But he's an arrant knave
.
  Hor. There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
    To tell us this.
  Ham. Why, righ
t! You are in the right!
    And so, without more circumstance at all,
    I hold it fit that we s
hake hands and part;
    You, as your business and desires shall point you,
    For every man hath
 business and desire,
    Such as it is; and for my own poor part,
    Look you, I'll go pray.
  
Hor. These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
  Ham. I am sorry they offend you, heartily;

    Yes, faith, heartily.
  Hor. There's no offence, my lord.
  Ham. Yes, by Saint Patrick, but th
ere is, Horatio,
    And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
    It is an honest ghost, t
hat let me tell you.
    For your desire to know what is between us,
    O'ermaster't as you may. 
And now, good friends,
    As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,
    Give me one poor reques
t.
  Hor. What is't, my lord? We will.
  Ham. Never make known what you have seen to-night.
  Bot
h. My lord, we will not.
  Ham. Nay, but swear't.
  Hor. In faith,
    My lord, not I.
  Mar. No
r I, my lord- in faith.
  Ham. Upon my sword.
  Mar. We have sworn, my lord, already.
  Ham. Inde
ed, upon my sword, indeed.

                 Ghost cries under the stage.

  Ghost. Swear.
  Ha
m. Aha boy, say'st thou so? Art thou there, truepenny?
    Come on! You hear this fellow in the cel
larage.
    Consent to swear.
  Hor. Propose the oath, my lord.
  Ham. Never to speak of this tha
t you have seen.
    Swear by my sword.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
  Ham. Hic et ubique? Then we'l
l shift our ground.
    Come hither, gentlemen,
    And lay your hands again upon my sword.
    N
ever to speak of this that you have heard:
    Swear by my sword.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear by his 
sword.
  Ham. Well said, old mole! Canst work i' th' earth so fast?
    A worthy pioner! Once more
 remove, good friends."
  Hor. O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
  Ham. And therefore
 as a stranger give it welcome.
    There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
    Than a
re dreamt of in your philosophy.
    But come!
    Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
   
 How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself
    (As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
    To put
 an antic disposition on),
    That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
    With arms encum
b'red thus, or this head-shake,
    Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
    As 'Well, well,
 we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'
    Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they mi
ght,'
    Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
    That you know aught of me- this is not to do,

    So grace and mercy at your most need help you,
    Swear.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
        
                                           [They swear.]
  Ham. Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! So, g
entlemen,
    With all my love I do commend me to you;
    And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
  
  May do t' express his love and friending to you,
    God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in to
gether;
    And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
    The time is out of joint. O cursed sp
ite
    That ever I was born to set it right!
    Nay, come, let's go together.
                 
                                        Exeunt.

Act II. Scene I.
Elsinore. A r
oom in the house of Polonius.

Enter Polonius and Reynaldo.

  Pol. Give him this money and thes
e notes, Reynaldo.
  Rey. I will, my lord.
  Pol. You shall do marvell's wisely, good Reynaldo,
 
   Before You visit him, to make inquire
    Of his behaviour.
  Rey. My lord, I did intend it.
 
 Pol. Marry, well said, very well said. Look you, sir,
    Enquire me first what Danskers are in Pa
ris;
    And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
    What company, at what expense; and
 finding
    By this encompassment and drift of question
    That they do know my son, come you mo
re nearer
    Than your particular demands will touch it.
    Take you, as 'twere, some distant kn
owledge of him;
    As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
    And in part him.' Do you mark
 this, Reynaldo?
  Rey. Ay, very well, my lord.
  Pol. 'And in part him, but,' you may say, 'not w
ell.
    But if't be he I mean, he's very wild
    Addicted so and so'; and there put on him
    
What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
    As may dishonour him- take heed of that;
    Bu
t, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips
    As are companions noted and most known
    To youth
 and liberty.
  Rey. As gaming, my lord.
  Pol. Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,

    Drabbing. You may go so far.
  Rey. My lord, that would dishonour him.
  Pol. Faith, no, as yo
u may season it in the charge.
    You must not put another scandal on him,
    That he is open to
 incontinency.
    That's not my meaning. But breathe his faults so quaintly
    That they may see
m the taints of liberty,
    The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
    A savageness in unreclaim
ed blood,
    Of general assault.
  Rey. But, my good lord-
  Pol. Wherefore should you do this?

  Rey. Ay, my lord,
    I would know that.
  Pol. Marry, sir, here's my drift,
    And I believe
 it is a fetch of warrant.
    You laying these slight sullies on my son
    As 'twere a thing a l
ittle soil'd i' th' working,
    Mark you,
    Your party in converse, him you would sound,
    H
aving ever seen in the prenominate crimes
    The youth you breathe of guilty, be assur'd
    He c
loses with you in this consequence:
    'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman'-
    Accord
ing to the phrase or the addition
    Of man and country-
  Rey. Very good, my lord.
  Pol. And t
hen, sir, does 'a this- 'a does- What was I about to
say?
    By the mass, I was about to say some
thing! Where did I leave?
  Rey. At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,' and
    gentle
man.'
  Pol. At 'closes in the consequence'- Ay, marry!
    He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman.

    I saw him yesterday, or t'other day,
    Or then, or then, with such or such; and, as you say
,
    There was 'a gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
    There falling out at tennis'; or perchan
ce,
    'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'
    Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
    See yo
u now-
    Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth;
    And thus do we of wisdom and of re
ach,
    With windlasses and with assays of bias,
    By indirections find directions out.
    So
, by my former lecture and advice,
    Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?
  Rey. My lord
, I have.
  Pol. God b' wi' ye, fare ye well!
  Rey. Good my lord!                                
    [Going.]
  Pol. Observe his inclination in yourself.
  Rey. I shall, my lord.
  Pol. And let 
him ply his music.
  Rey. Well, my lord.
  Pol. Farewell!
                                       
           Exit Reynaldo.

                       Enter Ophelia.

    How now, Ophelia? What's t
he matter?
  Oph. O my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
  Pol. With what, i' th' name of 
God?
  Oph. My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
    Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac'd,

    No hat upon his head, his stockings foul'd,
    Ungart'red, and down-gyved to his ankle;
   
 Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,
    And with a look so piteous in purport
    A
s if he had been loosed out of hell
    To speak of horrors- he comes before me.
  Pol. Mad for th
y love?
  Oph. My lord, I do not know,
    But truly I do fear it.
  Pol. What said he?
  Oph. H
e took me by the wrist and held me hard;
    Then goes he to the length of all his arm,
    And, w
ith his other hand thus o'er his brow,
    He falls to such perusal of my face
    As he would dra
w it. Long stay'd he so.
    At last, a little shaking of mine arm,
    And thrice his head thus w
aving up and down,
    He rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound
    As it did seem to shatter all 
his bulk
    And end his being. That done, he lets me go,
    And with his head over his shoulder 
turn'd
    He seem'd to find his way without his eyes,
    For out o' doors he went without their 
help
    And to the last bended their light on me.
  Pol. Come, go with me. I will go seek the Kin
g.
    This is the very ecstasy of love,
    Whose violent property fordoes itself
    And leads 
the will to desperate undertakings
    As oft as any passion under heaven
    That does afflict ou
r natures. I am sorry.
    What, have you given him any hard words of late?
  Oph. No, my good lor
d; but, as you did command,
    I did repel his letters and denied
    His access to me.
  Pol. T
hat hath made him mad.
    I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
    I had not quoted him.
 I fear'd he did but trifle
    And meant to wrack thee; but beshrew my jealousy!
    By heaven, i
t is as proper to our age
    To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
    As it is common for the
 younger sort
    To lack discretion. Come, go we to the King.
    This must be known; which, bein
g kept close, might move
    More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
    Come.
              
                                           Exeunt.

Scene II.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.


Flourish. [Enter King and Queen, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern,
cum aliis.

  King. Welcome, dear 
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
    Moreover that we much did long to see you,
    The need we have 
to use you did provoke
    Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
    Of Hamlet's transformat
ion. So I call it,
    Sith nor th' exterior nor the inward man
    Resembles that it was. What it
 should be,
    More than his father's death, that thus hath put him
    So much from th' understa
nding of himself,
    I cannot dream of. I entreat you both
    That, being of so young days broug
ht up with him,
    And since so neighbour'd to his youth and haviour,
    That you vouchsafe your
 rest here in our court
    Some little time; so by your companies
    To draw him on to pleasures
, and to gather
    So much as from occasion you may glean,
    Whether aught to us unknown afflic
ts him thus
    That, open'd, lies within our remedy.
  Queen. Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd
 of you,
    And sure I am two men there are not living
    To whom he more adheres. If it will pl
ease you
    To show us so much gentry and good will
    As to expend your time with us awhile
  
  For the supply and profit of our hope,
    Your visitation shall receive such thanks
    As fits
 a king's remembrance.
  Ros. Both your Majesties
    Might, by the sovereign power you have of us
,
    Put your dread pleasures more into command
    Than to entreaty.
  Guil. But we both obey,

    And here give up ourselves, in the full bent,
    To lay our service freely at your feet,
   
 To be commanded.
  King. Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
  Queen. Thanks, Guildenste
rn and gentle Rosencrantz.
    And I beseech you instantly to visit
    My too much changed son.- 
Go, some of you,
    And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
  Guil. Heavens make our presence 
and our practices
    Pleasant and helpful to him!
  Queen. Ay, amen!
                 Exeunt Ros
encrantz and Guildenstern, [with some
                                                    Attendant
s].

                         Enter Polonius.

  Pol. Th' ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,

    Are joyfully return'd.
  King. Thou still hast been the father of good news.
  Pol. Have I, 
my lord? Assure you, my good liege,
    I hold my duty as I hold my soul,
    Both to my God and t
o my gracious king;
    And I do think- or else this brain of mine
    Hunts not the trail of poli
cy so sure
    As it hath us'd to do- that I have found
    The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
  
King. O, speak of that! That do I long to hear.
  Pol. Give first admittance to th' ambassadors.
 
   My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
  King. Thyself do grace to them, and bring them
 in.
                                                [Exit Polonius.]
    He tells me, my dear Ger
trude, he hath found
    The head and source of all your son's distemper.
  Queen. I doubt it is n
o other but the main,
    His father's death and our o'erhasty marriage.
  King. Well, we shall si
ft him.

              Enter Polonius, Voltemand, and Cornelius.

    Welcome, my good friends.

    Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?
  Volt. Most fair return of greetings and desire
s.
    Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
    His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
   
 To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack,
    But better look'd into, he truly found
    It was aga
inst your Highness; whereat griev'd,
    That so his sickness, age, and impotence
    Was falsely 
borne in hand, sends out arrests
    On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys,
    Receives rebuke
 from Norway, and, in fine,
    Makes vow before his uncle never more
    To give th' assay of arm
s against your Majesty.
    Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
    Gives him three thousand cr
owns in annual fee
    And his commission to employ those soldiers,
    So levied as before, again
st the Polack;
    With an entreaty, herein further shown,
                                       
         [Gives a paper.]
    That it might please you to give quiet pass
    Through your dominio
ns for this enterprise,
    On such regards of safety and allowance
    As therein are set down.

  King. It likes us well;
    And at our more consider'd time we'll read,
    Answer, and think up
on this business.
    Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour.
    Go to your rest; at nig
ht we'll feast together.
    Most welcome home!                       Exeunt Ambassadors.
  Pol. T
his business is well ended.
    My liege, and madam, to expostulate
    What majesty should be, wh
at duty is,
    Why day is day, night is night, and time is time.
    Were nothing but to waste ni
ght, day, and time.
    Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
    And tediousness the limbs
 and outward flourishes,
    I will be brief. Your noble son is mad.
    Mad call I it; for, to de
fine true madness,
    What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
    But let that go.
  Queen. Mo
re matter, with less art.
  Pol. Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
    That he is mad, 'tis true
: 'tis true 'tis pity;
    And pity 'tis 'tis true. A foolish figure!
    But farewell it, for I w
ill use no art.
    Mad let us grant him then. And now remains
    That we find out the cause of t
his effect-
    Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
    For this effect defective comes by ca
use.
    Thus it remains, and the remainder thus.
    Perpend.
    I have a daughter (have while 
she is mine),
    Who in her duty and obedience, mark,
    Hath given me this. Now gather, and sur
mise.
                                             [Reads] the letter.
    'To the celestial, and 
my soul's idol, the most beautified
      Ophelia,'-

    That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'b
eautified' is a vile
      phrase.
    But you shall hear. Thus:
                                
                        [Reads.]
    'In her excellent white bosom, these, &c.'
  Queen. Came this
 from Hamlet to her?
  Pol. Good madam, stay awhile. I will be faithful.     [Reads.]


        
  'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
            Doubt that the sun doth move;
          Doubt truth 
to be a liar;
            But never doubt I love.
      'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers
; I have not art
to
    reckon my groans; but that I love thee best, O most best,
believe
    it
. Adieu.
      'Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to
him,

HAMLET.'

    
This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me;
    And more above, hath his solicitings,
    As th
ey fell out by time, by means, and place,
    All given to mine ear.
  King. But how hath she
   
 Receiv'd his love?
  Pol. What do you think of me?
  King. As of a man faithful and honourable.

  Pol. I would fain prove so. But what might you think,
    When I had seen this hot love on the wi
ng
    (As I perceiv'd it, I must tell you that,
    Before my daughter told me), what might you,

    Or my dear Majesty your queen here, think,
    If I had play'd the desk or table book,
    Or
 given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
    Or look'd upon this love with idle sight?
    What m
ight you think? No, I went round to work
    And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
    'Lord H
amlet is a prince, out of thy star.
    This must not be.' And then I prescripts gave her,
    Tha
t she should lock herself from his resort,
    Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
    Which d
one, she took the fruits of my advice,
    And he, repulsed, a short tale to make,
    Fell into a
 sadness, then into a fast,
    Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
    Thence to a lightne
ss, and, by this declension,
    Into the madness wherein now he raves,
    And all we mourn for.

  King. Do you think 'tis this?
  Queen. it may be, very like.
  Pol. Hath there been such a time
- I would fain know that-
    That I have Positively said ''Tis so,'
    When it prov'd otherwise.
?
  King. Not that I know.
  Pol. [points to his head and shoulder] Take this from this, if
this

      be otherwise.
    If circumstances lead me, I will find
    Where truth is hid, though it w
ere hid indeed
    Within the centre.
  King. How may we try it further?
  Pol. You know sometime
s he walks for hours together
    Here in the lobby.
  Queen. So he does indeed.
  Pol. At such a
 time I'll loose my daughter to him.
    Be you and I behind an arras then.
    Mark the encounter
. If he love her not,
    And he not from his reason fall'n thereon
    Let me be no assistant for
 a state,
    But keep a farm and carters.
  King. We will try it.

                 Enter Hamle
t, reading on a book.

  Queen. But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
  Pol. Away, 
I do beseech you, both away
    I'll board him presently. O, give me leave.
                      
 Exeunt King and Queen, [with Attendants].
    How does my good Lord Hamlet?
  Ham. Well, God-a-me
rcy.
  Pol. Do you know me, my lord?
  Ham. Excellent well. You are a fishmonger.
  Pol. Not I, m
y lord.
  Ham. Then I would you were so honest a man.
  Pol. Honest, my lord?
  Ham. Ay, sir. To 
be honest, as this world goes, is to be one
man
    pick'd out of ten thousand.
  Pol. That's ver
y true, my lord.
  Ham. For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god
    kissing carrio
n- Have you a daughter?
  Pol. I have, my lord.
  Ham. Let her not walk i' th' sun. Conception is 
a blessing, but
not
    as your daughter may conceive. Friend, look to't.
  Pol. [aside] How say 
you by that? Still harping on my daughter.
Yet
    he knew me not at first. He said I was a fishmo
nger. He is
far
    gone, far gone! And truly in my youth I suff'red much
extremity
    for love
- very near this. I'll speak to him again.- What do
you
    read, my lord?
  Ham. Words, words, w
ords.
  Pol. What is the matter, my lord?
  Ham. Between who?
  Pol. I mean, the matter that you 
read, my lord.
  Ham. Slanders, sir; for the satirical rogue says here that old
men
    have grey
 beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes
    purging thick amber and plum-tree gum; and t
hat they have a
    plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams. All
which,
    sir, thou
gh I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I
hold it
    not honesty to have it thus set down;
 for you yourself, sir,
    should be old as I am if, like a crab, you could go backward.

  Pol.
 [aside] Though this be madness, yet there is a method
in't.-
   Will You walk out of the air, my 
lord?
  Ham. Into my grave?
  Pol. Indeed, that is out o' th' air. [Aside] How pregnant
sometimes

    his replies are! a happiness that often madness hits on,
which
    reason and sanity could n
ot so prosperously be delivered of.
I
    will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meetin
g
between
    him and my daughter.- My honourable lord, I will most humbly
take
    my leave of 
you.
  Ham. You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more
    willingly part withal- exc
ept my life, except my life, except
my
    life,

                    Enter Rosencrantz and Guil
denstern.

  Pol. Fare you well, my lord.
  Ham. These tedious old fools!
  Pol. You go to seek 
the Lord Hamlet. There he is.
  Ros. [to Polonius] God save you, sir!
                            
                    Exit [Polonius].

  Guil. My honour'd lord!
  Ros. My most dear lord!
  Ham.
 My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern?
Ah,
    Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye
 both?
  Ros. As the indifferent children of the earth.
  Guil. Happy in that we are not over-happ
y.
    On Fortune's cap we are not the very button.
  Ham. Nor the soles of her shoe?
  Ros. Neit
her, my lord.
  Ham. Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her
    favours?
  Guil. 
Faith, her privates we.
  Ham. In the secret parts of Fortune? O! most true! she is a
    strumpet
. What news ?
  Ros. None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
  Ham. Then is doomsday nea
r! But your news is not true. Let me
    question more in particular. What have you, my good friend
s,
    deserved at the hands of Fortune that she sends you to prison
    hither?
  Guil. Prison, 
my lord?
  Ham. Denmark's a prison.
  Ros. Then is the world one.
  Ham. A goodly one; in which t
here are many confines, wards, and
    dungeons, Denmark being one o' th' worst.
  Ros. We think n
ot so, my lord.
  Ham. Why, then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either
good
    or bad bu
t thinking makes it so. To me it is a prison.
  Ros. Why, then your ambition makes it one. 'Tis too
 narrow for
your
    mind.
  Ham. O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a
   
 king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.
  Guil. Which dreams indeed are ambiti
on; for the very substance
of
    the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
  Ham. A dream i
tself is but a shadow.
  Ros. Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality
that
    
it is but a shadow's shadow.
  Ham. Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and
outstretch'd

    heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we to th' court? for, by
my
    fay, I cannot reason.
  
Both. We'll wait upon you.
  Ham. No such matter! I will not sort you with the rest of my
    serv
ants; for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most
    dreadfully attended. But in the beaten
 way of friendship,
what
    make you at Elsinore?
  Ros. To visit you, my lord; no other occasio
n.
  Ham. Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank
you;
    and sure, dear friends
, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny.
Were
    you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a
 free
    visitation? Come, deal justly with me. Come, come! Nay,
speak.
  Guil. What should we s
ay, my lord?
  Ham. Why, anything- but to th' purpose. You were sent for; and
    there is a kind 
of confession in your looks, which your
modesties
    have not craft enough to colour. I know the 
good King and
Queen
    have sent for you.
  Ros. To what end, my lord?
  Ham. That you must tea
ch me. But let me conjure you by the
rights
    of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth,
 by the
    obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear
a
    better proposer co
uld charge you withal, be even and direct
with
    me, whether you were sent for or no.
  Ros. [a
side to Guildenstern] What say you?
  Ham. [aside] Nay then, I have an eye of you.- If you love me,

hold
    not off.
  Guil. My lord, we were sent for.
  Ham. I will tell you why. So shall my an
ticipation prevent your
    discovery, and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no
    feather
. I have of late- but wherefore I know not- lost all
my
    mirth, forgone all custom of exercises
; and indeed, it goes
so
    heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the
earth,
    
seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy,
the
    air, look you, this brave o'
erhanging firmament, this
majestical
    roof fretted with golden fire- why, it appeareth no other

thing
    to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What
a
    piece of work is 
a man! how noble in reason! how infinite in
    faculties! in form and moving how express and admir
able! in
    action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the
    beauty of the world
, the paragon of animals! And yet to me
what
    is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me
- no, nor
woman
    neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.
  Ros. My lord, there was
 no such stuff in my thoughts.
  Ham. Why did you laugh then, when I said 'Man delights not me'?
 
 Ros. To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten
    entertainment the players shall
 receive from you. We coted
them
    on the way, and hither are they coming to offer you service.

  Ham. He that plays the king shall be welcome- his Majesty shall
    have tribute of me; the adve
nturous knight shall use his foil
and
    target; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humorous ma
n
shall
    end his part in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose
    lungs are tickle o'
 th' sere; and the lady shall say her mind
    freely, or the blank verse shall halt for't. What pl
ayers are
    they?
  Ros. Even those you were wont to take such delight in, the
    tragedians o
f the city.
  Ham. How chances it they travel? Their residence, both in
    reputation and profit,
 was better both ways.
  Ros. I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late
    innovati
on.
  Ham. Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in
the
    city? Are they so foll
ow'd?
  Ros. No indeed are they not.
  Ham. How comes it? Do they grow rusty?
  Ros. Nay, their e
ndeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there
is,
    sir, an eyrie of children, little eyases, tha
t cry out on the
top
    of question and are most tyrannically clapp'd for't. These
are now
    
the fashion, and so berattle the common stages (so they call
    them) that many wearing rapiers ar
e afraid of goosequills and
    dare scarce come thither.
  Ham. What, are they children? Who main
tains 'em? How are they
    escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can
    sing
? Will they not say afterwards, if they should grow
    themselves to common players (as it is most
 like, if their
means
    are no better), their writers do them wrong to make them
exclaim
    a
gainst their own succession.
  Ros. Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the
nation

    holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy. There was, for
a
    while, no money bid for a
rgument unless the poet and the
player
    went to cuffs in the question.
  Ham. Is't possible?

  Guil. O, there has been much throwing about of brains.
  Ham. Do the boys carry it away?
  Ros. 
Ay, that they do, my lord- Hercules and his load too.
  Ham. It is not very strange; for my uncle i
s King of Denmark,
and
    those that would make mows at him while my father lived give
    twent
y, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his picture
in
    little. 'Sblood, there is somethin
g in this more than
natural, if
    philosophy could find it out.

                     Flourish
 for the Players.

  Guil. There are the players.
  Ham. Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. 
Your hands, come!
Th'
    appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me
comply
    wit
h you in this garb, lest my extent to the players (which I
    tell you must show fairly outwards) 
should more appear like
    entertainment than yours. You are welcome. But my
uncle-father
    an
d aunt-mother are deceiv'd.
  Guil. In what, my dear lord?
  Ham. I am but mad north-north-west. W
hen the wind is southerly
I
    know a hawk from a handsaw.

                            Enter P
olonius.

  Pol. Well be with you, gentlemen!
  Ham. Hark you, Guildenstern- and you too- at each
 ear a hearer!
    That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling
    clouts.
  Ro
s. Happily he's the second time come to them; for they say an
old
    man is twice a child.
  Ham
. I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players. Mark
it.-
   You say right, sir; a Monday mo
rning; twas so indeed.
  Pol. My lord, I have news to tell you.
  Ham. My lord, I have news to tel
l you. When Roscius was an
actor in
    Rome-
  Pol. The actors are come hither, my lord.
  Ham.
 Buzz, buzz!
  Pol. Upon my honour-
  Ham. Then came each actor on his ass-
  Pol. The best actor
s in the world, either for tragedy, comedy,
    history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pas
toral,
    tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral;
scene
    individable, or p
oem unlimited. Seneca cannot be too heavy,
nor
    Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the 
liberty, these
are
    the only men.
  Ham. O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst th
ou!
  Pol. What treasure had he, my lord?
  Ham. Why,

         'One fair daughter, and no more,

           The which he loved passing well.'

  Pol. [aside] Still on my daughter.
  Ham. Am I 
not i' th' right, old Jephthah?
  Pol. If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I

    love passing well.
  Ham. Nay, that follows not.
  Pol. What follows then, my lord?
  Ham. Wh
y,

           'As by lot, God wot,'

 and then, you know,

           'It came to pass, as mo
st like it was.'

    The first row of the pious chanson will show you more; for
look
    where 
my abridgment comes.

                     Enter four or five Players.

    You are welcome, mas
ters; welcome, all.- I am glad to see
thee
    well.- Welcome, good friends.- O, my old friend? Wh
y, thy
face is
    valanc'd since I saw thee last. Com'st' thou to' beard me in
    Denmark?- Wha
t, my young lady and mistress? By'r Lady, your
    ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you
 last by the
    altitude of a chopine. Pray God your voice, like a piece of
    uncurrent gold, b
e not crack'd within the ring.- Masters, you
are
    all welcome. We'll e'en to't like French falc
oners, fly at
    anything we see. We'll have a speech straight. Come, give us
a
    taste of you
r quality. Come, a passionate speech.
  1. Play. What speech, my good lord?
  Ham. I heard thee sp
eak me a speech once, but it was never
acted;
    or if it was, not above once; for the play, I re
member,
pleas'd
    not the million, 'twas caviary to the general; but it was (as
I
    receiv'd
 it, and others, whose judgments in such matters
cried in
    the top of mine) an excellent play, 
well digested in the
scenes,
    set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember one said
  
  there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter
savoury,
    nor no matter in the phrase t
hat might indict the author of
    affectation; but call'd it an honest method, as wholesome as
  
  sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech
in't
    I chiefly lov'd. 'Twas AEne
as' tale to Dido, and thereabout
of it
    especially where he speaks of Priam's slaughter. If it 
live
in
    your memory, begin at this line- let me see, let me see:

         'The rugged Pyrrh
us, like th' Hyrcanian beast-'

    'Tis not so; it begins with Pyrrhus:

         'The rugged P
yrrhus, he whose sable arms,
         Black as his purpose, did the night resemble
         When h
e lay couched in the ominous horse,
         Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd
    
     With heraldry more dismal. Head to foot
         Now is be total gules, horridly trick'd
    
     With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
         Bak'd and impasted with the parching
 streets,
         That lend a tyrannous and a damned light
         To their lord's murther. Roas
ted in wrath and fire,
         And thus o'ersized with coagulate gore,
         With eyes like ca
rbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
         Old grandsire Priam seeks.'

    So, proceed you.
  Pol. 
Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good
     discretion.

  1. Play. 'Anon he f
inds him,
      Striking too short at Greeks. His antique sword,
      Rebellious to his arm, lies
 where it falls,
      Repugnant to command. Unequal match'd,
      Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in ra
ge strikes wide;
      But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
      Th' unnerved father fal
ls. Then senseless Ilium,
      Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
      Stoops to his ba
se, and with a hideous crash
      Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear. For lo! his sword,
      Which was
 declining on the milky head
      Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' th' air to stick.
      So, as a p
ainted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
      And, like a neutral to his will and matter,
      Did nothing.

      But, as we often see, against some storm,
      A silence in the heavens, the rack stand st
ill,
      The bold winds speechless, and the orb below
      As hush as death- anon the dreadful 
thunder
      Doth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
      Aroused vengeance sets him new
 awork;
      And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
      On Mars's armour, forg'd for proof ete
rne,
      With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
      Now falls on Priam.
      Out, ou
t, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods,
      In general synod take away her power;
      Break al
l the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
      And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
  
    As low as to the fiends!

  Pol. This is too long.
  Ham. It shall to the barber's, with your
 beard.- Prithee say
on.
    He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps. Say on;
come to
 
   Hecuba.

  1. Play. 'But who, O who, had seen the mobled queen-'

  Ham. 'The mobled queen'?

  Pol. That's good! 'Mobled queen' is good.

  1. Play. 'Run barefoot up and down, threat'ning th
e flames
      With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head
      Where late the diadem stood, and fo
r a robe,
      About her lank and all o'erteemed loins,
      A blanket, in the alarm of fear cau
ght up-
      Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd
      'Gainst Fortune's state would 
treason have pronounc'd.
      But if the gods themselves did see her then,
      When she saw Pyr
rhus make malicious sport
      In Mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,
      The instant b
urst of clamour that she made
      (Unless things mortal move them not at all)
      Would have m
ade milch the burning eyes of heaven
      And passion in the gods.'

  Pol. Look, whe'r he has n
ot turn'd his colour, and has tears
in's
    eyes. Prithee no more!
  Ham. 'Tis well. I'll have t
hee speak out the rest of this
soon.-
    Good my lord, will you see the players well bestow'd? Do
 you
    hear? Let them be well us'd; for they are the abstract and
brief
    chronicles of the t
ime. After your death you were better have
a
    bad epitaph than their ill report while you live.

  Pol. My lord, I will use them according to their desert.
  Ham. God's bodykins, man, much bette
r! Use every man after his
    desert, and who should scape whipping? Use them after your
own
   
 honour and dignity. The less they deserve, the more merit is
in
    your bounty. Take them in.
 
 Pol. Come, sirs.
  Ham. Follow him, friends. We'll hear a play to-morrow.
                 Exeunt
 Polonius and Players [except the First].
    Dost thou hear me, old friend? Can you play 'The Murt
her of
    Gonzago'?
  1. Play. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a 
need, study a
    speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which I would set down
and
    insert in'
t, could you not?
  1. Play. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Very well. Follow that lord- and look you mock hi
m not.
                                            [Exit First Player.]
    My good friends, I'll 
leave you till night. You are welcome
to
    Elsinore.
  Ros. Good my lord!
  Ham. Ay, so, God b
' wi' ye!
                            [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
    Now I am alone.
  
  O what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
    Is it not monstrous that this player here,
    But in
 a fiction, in a dream of passion,
    Could force his soul so to his own conceit
    That, from h
er working, all his visage wann'd,
    Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
    A broken vo
ice, and his whole function suiting
    With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!
    For He
cuba!
    What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
    That he should weep for her? What would he do
,
    Had he the motive and the cue for passion
    That I have? He would drown the stage with tea
rs
    And cleave the general ear with horrid speech;
    Make mad the guilty and appal the free,

    Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed
    The very faculties of eyes and ears.
    Yet I,

    A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak
    Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
    And 
can say nothing! No, not for a king,
    Upon whose property and most dear life
    A damn'd defea
t was made. Am I a coward?
    Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
    Plucks off my bear
d and blows it in my face?
    Tweaks me by th' nose? gives me the lie i' th' throat
    As deep a
s to the lungs? Who does me this, ha?
    'Swounds, I should take it! for it cannot be
    But I a
m pigeon-liver'd and lack gall
    To make oppression bitter, or ere this
    I should have fatted
 all the region kites
    With this slave's offal. Bloody bawdy villain!
    Remorseless, treacher
ous, lecherous, kindless villain!
    O, vengeance!
    Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,

    That I, the son of a dear father murther'd,
    Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
 
   Must (like a whore) unpack my heart with words
    And fall a-cursing like a very drab,
    A s
cullion!
    Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! Hum, I have heard
    That guilty creatures, sittin
g at a play,
    Have by the very cunning of the scene
    Been struck so to the soul that present
ly
    They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
    For murther, though it have no tongue, will sp
eak
    With most miraculous organ, I'll have these Players
    Play something like the murther of
 my father
    Before mine uncle. I'll observe his looks;
    I'll tent him to the quick. If he bu
t blench,
    I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
    May be a devil; and the devil hath
 power
    T' assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
    Out of my weakness and my melancholy,

    As he is very potent with such spirits,
    Abuses me to damn me. I'll have grounds
    More 
relative than this. The play's the thing
    Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King.        
 Exit.

ACT III. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King, Queen,
 Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern,
and Lords.

  King. And can you by no drift of cir
cumstance
    Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
    Grating so harshly all his days of q
uiet
    With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
  Ros. He does confess he feels himself distracted,

    But from what cause he will by no means speak.
  Guil. Nor do we find him forward to be sounde
d,
    But with a crafty madness keeps aloof
    When we would bring him on to some confession
  
  Of his true state.
  Queen. Did he receive you well?
  Ros. Most like a gentleman.
  Guil. But 
with much forcing of his disposition.
  Ros. Niggard of question, but of our demands
    Most free
 in his reply.
  Queen. Did you assay him
    To any pastime?
  Ros. Madam, it so fell out that c
ertain players
    We o'erraught on the way. Of these we told him,
    And there did seem in him a
 kind of joy
    To hear of it. They are here about the court,
    And, as I think, they have alre
ady order
    This night to play before him.
  Pol. 'Tis most true;
    And he beseech'd me to en
treat your Majesties
    To hear and see the matter.
  King. With all my heart, and it doth much c
ontent me
    To hear him so inclin'd.
    Good gentlemen, give him a further edge
    And drive 
his purpose on to these delights.
  Ros. We shall, my lord.
                            Exeunt Ros
encrantz and Guildenstern.
  King. Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
    For we have closely sent for 
Hamlet hither,
    That he, as 'twere by accident, may here
    Affront Ophelia.
    Her father a
nd myself (lawful espials)
    Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing unseen,
    We may of their e
ncounter frankly judge
    And gather by him, as he is behav'd,
    If't be th' affliction of his 
love, or no,
    That thus he suffers for.
  Queen. I shall obey you;
    And for your part, Ophe
lia, I do wish
    That your good beauties be the happy cause
    Of Hamlet's wildness. So shall I
 hope your virtues
    Will bring him to his wonted way again,
    To both your honours.
  Oph. M
adam, I wish it may.
                                                   [Exit Queen.]
  Pol. Ophel
ia, walk you here.- Gracious, so please you,
    We will bestow ourselves.- [To Ophelia] Read on th
is book,
    That show of such an exercise may colour
    Your loneliness.- We are oft to blame in
 this,
    'Tis too much prov'd, that with devotion's visage
    And pious action we do sugar o'er

    The Devil himself.
  King. [aside] O, 'tis too true!
    How smart a lash that speech doth g
ive my conscience!
    The harlot's cheek, beautied with plast'ring art,
    Is not more ugly to t
he thing that helps it
    Than is my deed to my most painted word.
    O heavy burthen!
  Pol. I
 hear him coming. Let's withdraw, my lord.
                                      Exeunt King and Po
lonius].

                           Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. To be, or not to be- that is the ques
tion:
    Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
    The slings and arrows of outrageous fortun
e
    Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
    And by opposing end them. To die- to sleep-

    No more; and by a sleep to say we end
    The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks
    T
hat flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation
    Devoutly to be wish'd. To die- to sleep.
    To slee
p- perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub!
    For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
  
  When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
    Must give us pause. There's the respect
    That
 makes calamity of so long life.
    For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
    Th' oppr
essor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
    The pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay,
    The
 insolence of office, and the spurns
    That patient merit of th' unworthy takes,
    When he him
self might his quietus make
    With a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear,
    To grunt and
 sweat under a weary life,
    But that the dread of something after death-
    The undiscover'd c
ountry, from whose bourn
    No traveller returns- puzzles the will,
    And makes us rather bear 
those ills we have
    Than fly to others that we know not of?
    Thus conscience does make cowar
ds of us all,
    And thus the native hue of resolution
    Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of
 thought,
    And enterprises of great pith and moment
    With this regard their currents turn aw
ry
    And lose the name of action.- Soft you now!
    The fair Ophelia!- Nymph, in thy orisons
 
   Be all my sins rememb'red.
  Oph. Good my lord,
    How does your honour for this many a day?

  Ham. I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
  Oph. My lord, I have remembrances of yours
    That
 I have longed long to re-deliver.
    I pray you, now receive them.
  Ham. No, not I!
    I neve
r gave you aught.
  Oph. My honour'd lord, you know right well you did,
    And with them words of
 so sweet breath compos'd
    As made the things more rich. Their perfume lost,
    Take these aga
in; for to the noble mind
    Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
    There, my lord.
 
 Ham. Ha, ha! Are you honest?
  Oph. My lord?
  Ham. Are you fair?
  Oph. What means your lordshi
p?
  Ham. That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit
no
    discourse to your beau
ty.
  Oph. Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with
honesty?
  Ham. Ay, truly; for t
he power of beauty will sooner transform
    honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of ho
nesty
can
    translate beauty into his likeness. This was sometime a
paradox,
    but now the t
ime gives it proof. I did love you once.
  Oph. Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
  Ham. Yo
u should not have believ'd me; for virtue cannot so
    inoculate our old stock but we shall relish
 of it. I loved
you
    not.
  Oph. I was the more deceived.
  Ham. Get thee to a nunnery! Why w
ouldst thou be a breeder of
    sinners? I am myself indifferent honest, but yet I could
accuse
 
   me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne
me.
    I am very proud, revengef
ul, ambitious; with more offences at
my
    beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination 
to give
    them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows
as I
    do, crawling be
tween earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves
all;
    believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery
. Where's your
    father?
  Oph. At home, my lord.
  Ham. Let the doors be shut upon him, that h
e may play the fool
    nowhere but in's own house. Farewell.
  Oph. O, help him, you sweet heaven
s!
  Ham. If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy
dowry:
    be thou as chaste as 
ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not
escape
    calumny. Get thee to a nunnery. Go, farewell. Or i
f thou wilt
    needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what
    monsters you mak
e of them. To a nunnery, go; and quickly too.
    Farewell.
  Oph. O heavenly powers, restore him!

  Ham. I have heard of your paintings too, well enough. God hath
    given you one face, and you 
make yourselves another. You jig,
you
    amble, and you lisp; you nickname God's creatures and ma
ke
your
    wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't! it hath
made
    me mad. I say,
 we will have no more marriages. Those that are
    married already- all but one- shall live; the r
est shall keep
as
    they are. To a nunnery, go.                            Exit.
  Oph. O, what
 a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
    The courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword,
  
  Th' expectancy and rose of the fair state,
    The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
    T
h' observ'd of all observers- quite, quite down!
    And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
  
  That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
    Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
    L
ike sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
    That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth

    Blasted with ecstasy. O, woe is me
    T' have seen what I have seen, see what I see!

     
              Enter King and Polonius.

  King. Love? his affections do not that way tend;
    No
r what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,
    Was not like madness. There's something in his
 soul
    O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
    And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose

    Will be some danger; which for to prevent,
    I have in quick determination
    Thus set it d
own: he shall with speed to England
    For the demand of our neglected tribute.
    Haply the sea
s, and countries different,
    With variable objects, shall expel
    This something-settled matt
er in his heart,
    Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
    From fashion of himself. W
hat think you on't?
  Pol. It shall do well. But yet do I believe
    The origin and commencement 
of his grief
    Sprung from neglected love.- How now, Ophelia?
    You need not tell us what Lord
 Hamlet said.
    We heard it all.- My lord, do as you please;
    But if you hold it fit, after t
he play
    Let his queen mother all alone entreat him
    To show his grief. Let her be round wit
h him;
    And I'll be plac'd so please you, in the ear
    Of all their conference. If she find h
im not,
    To England send him; or confine him where
    Your wisdom best shall think.
  King. I
t shall be so.
    Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.         Exeunt.




Scene II.

Elsinore. hall in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet and three of the Players.

  Ham. Speak the speech,
 I pray you, as I pronounc'd it to you,
    trippingly on the tongue. But if you mouth it, as many 
of our
    players do, I had as live the town crier spoke my lines. Nor
do
    not saw the air to
o much with your hand, thus, but use all
    gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and (as I ma
y say)
    whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and beget a
    temperance that may give it
 smoothness. O, it offends me to
the
    soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a pas
sion
to
    tatters, to very rags, to split the cars of the groundlings,
who
    (for the most p
art) are capable of nothing but inexplicable
dumb
    shows and noise. I would have such a fellow 
whipp'd for
o'erdoing
    Termagant. It out-herods Herod. Pray you avoid it.
  Player. I warrant 
your honour.
  Ham. Be not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be
your
    tutor. Suit 
the action to the word, the word to the action;
with
    this special observance, that you o'erste
p not the modesty of
    nature: for anything so overdone is from the purpose of
playing,
    who
se end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as
    'twere, the mirror up to nature; to 
show Virtue her own
feature,
    scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time
his

    form and pressure. Now this overdone, or come tardy off,
though
    it make the unskilful laug
h, cannot but make the judicious
    grieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance
 
   o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that
I
    have seen play, and heard o
thers praise, and that highly (not
to
    speak it profanely), that, neither having the accent of

    Christians, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have
so
    strutted and bellowed that
 I have thought some of Nature's
    journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they
imitate
d
    humanity so abominably.
  Player. I hope we have reform'd that indifferently with us,
sir.

  Ham. O, reform it altogether! And let those that play your
clowns
    speak no more than is set
 down for them. For there be of them
    that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of bar
ren
    spectators to laugh too, though in the mean time some
necessary
    question of the play 
be then to be considered. That's
villanous
    and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that 
uses it.
Go
    make you ready.
                                                 Exeunt Players.


            Enter Polonius, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.

    How now, my lord? Will the King
 hear this piece of work?
  Pol. And the Queen too, and that presently.
  Ham. Bid the players mak
e haste, [Exit Polonius.] Will you two
    help to hasten them?
  Both. We will, my lord.         
              Exeunt they two.
  Ham. What, ho, Horatio!

                      Enter Horatio.


  Hor. Here, sweet lord, at your service.
  Ham. Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
    As e'er
 my conversation cop'd withal.
  Hor. O, my dear lord!
  Ham. Nay, do not think I flatter;
    Fo
r what advancement may I hope from thee,
    That no revenue hast but thy good spirits
    To feed
 and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
    No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp
,
    And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
    Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hea
r?
    Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
    And could of men distinguish, her electio
n
    Hath seal'd thee for herself. For thou hast been
    As one, in suff'ring all, that suffers 
nothing;
    A man that Fortune's buffets and rewards
    Hast ta'en with equal thanks; and blest 
are those
    Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled
    That they are not a pipe for For
tune's finger
    To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
    That is not passion's slave,
 and I will wear him
    In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
    As I do thee. Something
 too much of this I
    There is a play to-night before the King.
    One scene of it comes near t
he circumstance,
    Which I have told thee, of my father's death.
    I prithee, when thou seest 
that act afoot,
    Even with the very comment of thy soul
    Observe my uncle. If his occulted g
uilt
    Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
    It is a damned ghost that we have seen,
    An
d my imaginations are as foul
    As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
    For I mine eyes w
ill rivet to his face,
    And after we will both our judgments join
    In censure of his seeming
.
  Hor. Well, my lord.
    If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
    And scape dete
cting, I will pay the theft.

    Sound a flourish. [Enter Trumpets and Kettledrums. Danish
    m
arch. [Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz,
      Guildenstern, and other Lords atten
dant, with the Guard
                       carrying torches.

  Ham. They are coming to the play
. I must be idle.
    Get you a place.
  King. How fares our cousin Hamlet?
  Ham. Excellent, i' 
faith; of the chameleon's dish. I eat the
air,
    promise-cramm'd. You cannot feed capons so.
  
King. I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet. These words are
not
    mine.
  Ham. No, nor mine 
now. [To Polonius] My lord, you play'd once
    i' th' university, you say?
  Pol. That did I, my 
lord, and was accounted a good actor.
  Ham. What did you enact?
  Pol. I did enact Julius Caesar;
 I was kill'd i' th' Capitol;
Brutus
    kill'd me.
  Ham. It was a brute part of him to kill so 
capital a calf
there. Be
    the players ready.
  Ros. Ay, my lord. They stay upon your patience.

  Queen. Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
  Ham. No, good mother. Here's metal more attrac
tive.
  Pol. [to the King] O, ho! do you mark that?
  Ham. Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
       
                           [Sits down at Ophelia's feet.]

  Oph. No, my lord.
  Ham. I mean, my 
head upon your lap?
  Oph. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Do you think I meant country matters?
  Oph. I thi
nk nothing, my lord.
  Ham. That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
  Oph. What is, my l
ord?
  Ham. Nothing.
  Oph. You are merry, my lord.
  Ham. Who, I?
  Oph. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. O
 God, your only jig-maker! What should a man do but be
merry?
    For look you how cheerfully my m
other looks, and my father
died
    within 's two hours.
  Oph. Nay 'tis twice two months, my lor
d.
  Ham. So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I'll have
a
    suit of sables. O heav
ens! die two months ago, and not
forgotten
    yet? Then there's hope a great man's memory may out
live his
life
    half a year. But, by'r Lady, he must build churches then; or
else
    shall he
 suffer not thinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose

    epitaph is 'For O, for O, the hobby-hors
e is forgot!'

               Hautboys play. The dumb show enters.

    Enter a King and a Queen
 very lovingly; the Queen embracing
    him and he her. She kneels, and makes show of protestation

    unto him. He takes her up, and declines his head upon her
    neck. He lays him down upon a ba
nk of flowers. She, seeing
    him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his
    c
rown, kisses it, pours poison in the sleeper's ears, and
    leaves him. The Queen returns, finds t
he King dead, and makes
    passionate action. The Poisoner with some three or four
Mutes,
    co
mes in again, seem to condole with her. The dead body is
    carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Q
ueen with gifts; she
    seems harsh and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts
    his love.
 
                                                        Exeunt.

  Oph. What means this, my lord?

  Ham. Marry, this is miching malhecho; it means mischief.
  Oph. Belike this show imports the arg
ument of the play.

                      Enter Prologue.

  Ham. We shall know by this fellow. 
The players cannot keep
counsel;
    they'll tell all.
  Oph. Will he tell us what this show mean
t?
  Ham. Ay, or any show that you'll show him. Be not you asham'd
to
    show, he'll not shame t
o tell you what it means.
  Oph. You are naught, you are naught! I'll mark the play.

    Pro. Fo
r us, and for our tragedy,
      Here stooping to your clemency,
      We beg your hearing patient
ly.                     [Exit.]

  Ham. Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
  Oph. 'Tis br
ief, my lord.
  Ham. As woman's love.

              Enter [two Players as] King and Queen.

  
  King. Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round
      Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed
 ground,
      And thirty dozen moons with borrowed sheen
      About the world have times twelve 
thirties been,
      Since love our hearts, and Hymen did our hands,
      Unite comutual in most 
sacred bands.
    Queen. So many journeys may the sun and moon
      Make us again count o'er ere 
love be done!
      But woe is me! you are so sick of late,
      So far from cheer and from your 
former state.
      That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
      Discomfort you, my lord, it
 nothing must;
      For women's fear and love holds quantity,
      In neither aught, or in extre
mity.
      Now what my love is, proof hath made you know;
      And as my love is siz'd, my fear 
is so.
      Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
      Where little fears grow grea
t, great love grows there.
    King. Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;
      My ope
rant powers their functions leave to do.
      And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
    
  Honour'd, belov'd, and haply one as kind
      For husband shalt thou-
    Queen. O, confound th
e rest!
      Such love must needs be treason in my breast.
      When second husband let me be ac
curst!
      None wed the second but who killed the first.

  Ham. [aside] Wormwood, wormwood!


    Queen. The instances that second marriage move
      Are base respects of thrift, but none of 
love.
      A second time I kill my husband dead
      When second husband kisses me in bed.
    
King. I do believe you think what now you speak;
      But what we do determine oft we break.
    
  Purpose is but the slave to memory,
      Of violent birth, but poor validity;
      Which now, 
like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree,
      But fall unshaken when they mellow be.
      Most nec
essary 'tis that we forget
      To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt.
      What to ourselv
es in passion we propose,
      The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
      The violence of e
ither grief or joy
      Their own enactures with themselves destroy.
      Where joy most revels,
 grief doth most lament;
      Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
      This world is n
ot for aye, nor 'tis not strange
      That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
      
For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
      Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
 
     The great man down, you mark his favourite flies,
      The poor advanc'd makes friends of ene
mies;
      And hitherto doth love on fortune tend,
      For who not needs shall never lack a fri
end,
      And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
      Directly seasons him his enemy.
      
But, orderly to end where I begun,
      Our wills and fates do so contrary run
      That our dev
ices still are overthrown;
      Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own.
      So think
 thou wilt no second husband wed;
      But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
    Quee
n. Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light,
      Sport and repose lock from me day and night,

      To desperation turn my trust and hope,
      An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope,
     
 Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
      Meet what I would have well, and it destroy,
    
  Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
      If, once a widow, ever I be wife!

  Ham. I
f she should break it now!

    King. 'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile.
      My sp
irits grow dull, and fain I would beguile
      The tedious day with sleep.
    Queen. Sleep rock 
thy brain,
                                                    [He] sleeps.
      And never come m
ischance between us twain!
Exit.

  Ham. Madam, how like you this play?
  Queen. The lady doth p
rotest too much, methinks.
  Ham. O, but she'll keep her word.
  King. Have you heard the argument
? Is there no offence in't?
  Ham. No, no! They do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i'
th'
  
  world.
  King. What do you call the play?
  Ham. 'The Mousetrap.' Marry, how? Tropically. This p
lay is the
    image of a murther done in Vienna. Gonzago is the duke's
name;
    his wife, Bapti
sta. You shall see anon. 'Tis a knavish piece
of
    work; but what o' that? Your Majesty, and we 
that have free
    souls, it touches us not. Let the gall'd jade winch; our
withers
    are unwru
ng.

                         Enter Lucianus.

    This is one Lucianus, nephew to the King.
  
Oph. You are as good as a chorus, my lord.
  Ham. I could interpret between you and your love, if I
 could
see
    the puppets dallying.
  Oph. You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
  Ham. It would
 cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
  Oph. Still better, and worse.
  Ham. So you must take 
your husbands.- Begin, murtherer. Pox,
leave
    thy damnable faces, and begin! Come, the croaking
 raven doth
    bellow for revenge.

    Luc. Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agre
eing;
      Confederate season, else no creature seeing;
      Thou mixture rank, of midnight weed
s collected,
      With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,
      Thy natural magic and 
dire property
      On wholesome life usurp immediately.
                                   Pours 
the poison in his ears.

  Ham. He poisons him i' th' garden for's estate. His name's
Gonzago.
 
   The story is extant, and written in very choice Italian. You
    shall see anon how the murthere
r gets the love of Gonzago's
wife.
  Oph. The King rises.
  Ham. What, frighted with false fire?

  Queen. How fares my lord?
  Pol. Give o'er the play.
  King. Give me some light! Away!
  All. 
Lights, lights, lights!
                              Exeunt all but Hamlet and Horatio.
  Ham.   
Why, let the strucken deer go weep,
          The hart ungalled play;
         For some must watch
, while some must sleep:
          Thus runs the world away.
    Would not this, sir, and a forest
 of feathers- if the rest of
my
    fortunes turn Turk with me-with two Provincial roses on my
ra
z'd
    shoes, get me a fellowship in a cry of players, sir?
  Hor. Half a share.
  Ham.   A whol
e one I!
         For thou dost know, O Damon dear,
           This realm dismantled was
        
 Of Jove himself; and now reigns here
           A very, very- pajock.
  Hor. You might have rhym'
d.
  Ham. O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand
    pound! Didst perceive?
  
Hor. Very well, my lord.
  Ham. Upon the talk of the poisoning?
  Hor. I did very well note him.

  Ham.   Aha! Come, some music! Come, the recorders!
         For if the King like not the comedy,

         Why then, belike he likes it not, perdy.
    Come, some music!

                Enter R
osencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Guil. Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.
  Ham. Sir, a w
hole history.
  Guil. The King, sir-
  Ham. Ay, sir, what of him?
  Guil. Is in his retirement, m
arvellous distemper'd.
  Ham. With drink, sir?
  Guil. No, my lord; rather with choler.
  Ham. Yo
ur wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this
to
    the doctor; for me to put him to h
is purgation would perhaps
    plunge him into far more choler.
  Guil. Good my lord, put your dis
course into some frame, and
start
    not so wildly from my affair.
  Ham. I am tame, sir; pronou
nce.
  Guil. The Queen, your mother, in most great affliction of
spirit
    hath sent me to you.

  Ham. You are welcome.
  Guil. Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right
breed.
    
If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, I will
do
    your mother's commandment; if 
not, your pardon and my return
    shall be the end of my business.
  Ham. Sir, I cannot.
  Guil.
 What, my lord?
  Ham. Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseas'd. But, sir,
such
    answer 
as I can make, you shall command; or rather, as you
say,
    my mother. Therefore no more, but to 
the matter! My mother,
you
    say-
  Ros. Then thus she says: your behaviour hath struck her int
o
    amazement and admiration.
  Ham. O wonderful son, that can so stonish a mother! But is
ther
e no
    sequel at the heels of this mother's admiration? Impart.
  Ros. She desires to speak with
 you in her closet ere you go to
bed.
  Ham. We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have yo
u any
    further trade with us?
  Ros. My lord, you once did love me.
  Ham. And do still, by th
ese pickers and stealers!
  Ros. Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? You do
surely
   
 bar the door upon your own liberty, if you deny your griefs
to
    your friend.
  Ham. Sir, I la
ck advancement.
  Ros. How can that be, when you have the voice of the King
himself
    for your 
succession in Denmark?
  Ham. Ay, sir, but 'while the grass grows'- the proverb is
something
    
musty.

                     Enter the Players with recorders.

    O, the recorders! Let me see
 one. To withdraw with you- why
do
    you go about to recover the wind of me, as if you would dri
ve
me
    into a toil?
  Guil. O my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too
unmannerly.
  
Ham. I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this
pipe?
  Guil. My lord, I cannot.
  Ha
m. I pray you.
  Guil. Believe me, I cannot.
  Ham. I do beseech you.
  Guil. I know, no touch of
 it, my lord.
  Ham. It is as easy as lying. Govern these ventages with your
    fingers and thumb
s, give it breath with your mouth, and it
will
    discourse most eloquent music. Look you, these 
are the stops.
  Guil. But these cannot I command to any utt'rance of harmony. I
    have not the 
skill.
  Ham. Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me!
You
    would play upon me;
 you would seem to know my stops; you
would
    pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound
 me from my
    lowest note to the top of my compass; and there is much
music,
    excellent voic
e, in this little organ, yet cannot you make it
    speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am easier to be 
play'd on than
a
    pipe? Call me what instrument you will, though you can fret
me,
    you can
not play upon me.

                        Enter Polonius.

    God bless you, sir!
  Pol. My l
ord, the Queen would speak with you, and presently.
  Ham. Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in
 shape of a camel?
  Pol. By th' mass, and 'tis like a camel indeed.
  Ham. Methinks it is like a 
weasel.
  Pol. It is back'd like a weasel.
  Ham. Or like a whale.
  Pol. Very like a whale.
  H
am. Then will I come to my mother by-and-by.- They fool me to
the
    top of my bent.- I will come
 by-and-by.
  Pol. I will say so.                                      Exit.
  Ham. 'By-and-by' is
 easily said.- Leave me, friends.
                                        [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]


    'Tis now the very witching time of night,
    When churchyards yawn, and hell itself breathe
s out
    Contagion to this world. Now could I drink hot blood
    And do such bitter business as 
the day
    Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother!
    O heart, lose not thy nature; let 
not ever
    The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom.
    Let me be cruel, not unnatural;
    I wi
ll speak daggers to her, but use none.
    My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites-
    How in my
 words somever she be shent,
    To give them seals never, my soul, consent!             Exit.





Scene III.
A room in the Castle.

Enter King, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.

  King. I li
ke him not, nor stands it safe with us
    To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;
    I 
your commission will forthwith dispatch,
    And he to England shall along with you.
    The terms
 of our estate may not endure
    Hazard so near us as doth hourly grow
    Out of his lunacies.

  Guil. We will ourselves provide.
    Most holy and religious fear it is
    To keep those many m
any bodies safe
    That live and feed upon your Majesty.
  Ros. The single and peculiar life is b
ound
    With all the strength and armour of the mind
    To keep itself from noyance; but much mo
re
    That spirit upon whose weal depends and rests
    The lives of many. The cesse of majesty

    Dies not alone, but like a gulf doth draw
    What's near it with it. It is a massy wheel,
   
 Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,
    To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
   
 Are mortis'd and adjoin'd; which when it falls,
    Each small annexment, petty consequence,
    
Attends the boist'rous ruin. Never alone
    Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.
  King. 
Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;
    For we will fetters put upon this fear,
    Which 
now goes too free-footed.
  Both. We will haste us.
                                              
 Exeunt Gentlemen.

                   Enter Polonius.

  Pol. My lord, he's going to his mother
's closet.
    Behind the arras I'll convey myself
    To hear the process. I'll warrant she'll ta
x him home;
    And, as you said, and wisely was it said,
    'Tis meet that some more audience th
an a mother,
    Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear
    The speech, of vantage. Fare
 you well, my liege.
    I'll call upon you ere you go to bed
    And tell you what I know.
  Kin
g. Thanks, dear my lord.
                                                Exit [Polonius].
    O, m
y offence is rank, it smells to heaven;
    It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,
    A brother'
s murther! Pray can I not,
    Though inclination be as sharp as will.
    My stronger guilt defea
ts my strong intent,
    And, like a man to double business bound,
    I stand in pause where I sh
all first begin,
    And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
    Were thicker than itself with 
brother's blood,
    Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
    To wash it white as snow? W
hereto serves mercy
    But to confront the visage of offence?
    And what's in prayer but this t
wofold force,
    To be forestalled ere we come to fall,
    Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll loo
k up;
    My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer
    Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul
 murther'?
    That cannot be; since I am still possess'd
    Of those effects for which I did the
 murther-
    My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.
    May one be pardon'd and retain th' of
fence?
    In the corrupted currents of this world
    Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,

    And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
    Buys out the law; but 'tis not so above.
    T
here is no shuffling; there the action lies
    In his true nature, and we ourselves compell'd,
  
  Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
    To give in evidence. What then? What rests?
  
  Try what repentance can. What can it not?
    Yet what can it when one cannot repent?
    O wret
ched state! O bosom black as death!
    O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
    Art more en
gag'd! Help, angels! Make assay.
    Bow, stubborn knees; and heart with strings of steel,
    Be 
soft as sinews of the new-born babe!
    All may be well.                                  He kneel
s.

                         Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
  
  And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven,
    And so am I reveng'd. That would be scann'd.
  
  A villain kills my father; and for that,
    I, his sole son, do this same villain send
    To h
eaven.
    Why, this is hire and salary, not revenge!
    He took my father grossly, full of bread
,
    With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
    And how his audit stands, who knows sa
ve heaven?
    But in our circumstance and course of thought,
    'Tis heavy with him; and am I th
en reveng'd,
    To take him in the purging of his soul,
    When he is fit and seasoned for his p
assage?
    No.
    Up, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent.
    When he is drunk asleep; or 
in his rage;
    Or in th' incestuous pleasure of his bed;
    At gaming, swearing, or about some 
act
    That has no relish of salvation in't-
    Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven
,
    And that his soul may be as damn'd and black
    As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays.

    This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.              Exit.
  King. [rises] My words fly up, 
my thoughts remain below.
    Words without thoughts never to heaven go.             Exit.





Scene IV.
The Queen's closet.

Enter Queen and Polonius.

  Pol. He will come straight. Look y
ou lay home to him.
    Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,
    And that your Gr
ace hath screen'd and stood between
    Much heat and him. I'll silence me even here.
    Pray you
 be round with him.
  Ham. (within) Mother, mother, mother!
  Queen. I'll warrant you; fear me not
. Withdraw; I hear him
coming.
                              [Polonius hides behind the arras.]


                          Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Now, mother, what's the matter?
  Queen. Hamlet,
 thou hast thy father much offended.
  Ham. Mother, you have my father much offended.
  Queen. Com
e, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
  Ham. Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
  Queen
. Why, how now, Hamlet?
  Ham. What's the matter now?
  Queen. Have you forgot me?
  Ham. No, by 
the rood, not so!
    You are the Queen, your husband's brother's wife,
    And (would it were not
 so!) you are my mother.
  Queen. Nay, then I'll set those to you that can speak.
  Ham. Come, com
e, and sit you down. You shall not budge;
    You go not till I set you up a glass
    Where you m
ay see the inmost part of you.
  Queen. What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murther me?
    Help, hel
p, ho!
  Pol. [behind] What, ho! help, help, help!
  Ham. [draws] How now? a rat? Dead for a ducat
, dead!
            [Makes a pass through the arras and] kills Polonius.
  Pol. [behind] O, I am s
lain!
  Queen. O me, what hast thou done?
  Ham. Nay, I know not. Is it the King?
  Queen. O, wha
t a rash and bloody deed is this!
  Ham. A bloody deed- almost as bad, good mother,
    As kill a 
king, and marry with his brother.
  Queen. As kill a king?
  Ham. Ay, lady, it was my word.
     
                    [Lifts up the arras and sees Polonius.]
    Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool
, farewell!
    I took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune.
    Thou find'st to be too busy is s
ome danger.
    Leave wringing of your hands. Peace! sit you down
    And let me wring your heart;
 for so I shall
    If it be made of penetrable stuff;
    If damned custom have not braz'd it so

    That it is proof and bulwark against sense.
  Queen. What have I done that thou dar'st wag thy
 tongue
    In noise so rude against me?
  Ham. Such an act
    That blurs the grace and blush of
 modesty;
    Calls virtue hypocrite; takes off the rose
    From the fair forehead of an innocent
 love,
    And sets a blister there; makes marriage vows
    As false as dicers' oaths. O, such a 
deed
    As from the body of contraction plucks
    The very soul, and sweet religion makes
    A
 rhapsody of words! Heaven's face doth glow;
    Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
    With tr
istful visage, as against the doom,
    Is thought-sick at the act.
  Queen. Ah me, what act,
   
 That roars so loud and thunders in the index?
  Ham. Look here upon th's picture, and on this,
  
  The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
    See what a grace was seated on this brow;
    H
yperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
    An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
    A s
tation like the herald Mercury
    New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill:
    A combination and a f
orm indeed
    Where every god did seem to set his seal
    To give the world assurance of a man.

    This was your husband. Look you now what follows.
    Here is your husband, like a mildew'd ea
r
    Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
    Could you on this fair mountain leave to 
feed,
    And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes
    You cannot call it love; for at your age

    The heyday in the blood is tame, it's humble,
    And waits upon the judgment; and what judgme
nt
    Would step from this to this? Sense sure you have,
    Else could you not have motion; but 
sure that sense
    Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,
    Nor sense to ecstacy was ne'er so
 thrall'd
    But it reserv'd some quantity of choice
    To serve in such a difference. What devi
l was't
    That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
    Eyes without feeling, feeling without
 sight,
    Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
    Or but a sickly part of one true se
nse
    Could not so mope.
    O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
    If thou canst mu
tine in a matron's bones,
    To flaming youth let virtue be as wax
    And melt in her own fire. 
Proclaim no shame
    When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
    Since frost itself as activ
ely doth burn,
    And reason panders will.
  Queen. O Hamlet, speak no more!
    Thou turn'st mi
ne eyes into my very soul,
    And there I see such black and grained spots
    As will not leave 
their tinct.
  Ham. Nay, but to live
    In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
    Stew'd in corr
uption, honeying and making love
    Over the nasty sty!
  Queen. O, speak to me no more!
    The
se words like daggers enter in mine ears.
    No more, sweet Hamlet!
  Ham. A murtherer and a vill
ain!
    A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
    Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;

    A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
    That from a shelf the precious diadem stole
    A
nd put it in his pocket!
  Queen. No more!

                Enter the Ghost in his nightgown.


  Ham. A king of shreds and patches!-
    Save me and hover o'er me with your wings,
    You heave
nly guards! What would your gracious figure?
  Queen. Alas, he's mad!
  Ham. Do you not come your 
tardy son to chide,
    That, laps'd in time and passion, lets go by
    Th' important acting of y
our dread command?
    O, say!
  Ghost. Do not forget. This visitation
    Is but to whet thy alm
ost blunted purpose.
    But look, amazement on thy mother sits.
    O, step between her and her f
ighting soul
    Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works.
    Speak to her, Hamlet.
  Ham. How 
is it with you, lady?
  Queen. Alas, how is't with you,
    That you do bend your eye on vacancy,

    And with th' encorporal air do hold discourse?
    Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep
;
    And, as the sleeping soldiers in th' alarm,
    Your bedded hairs, like life in excrements,

    Start up and stand an end. O gentle son,
    Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
    Spr
inkle cool patience! Whereon do you look?
  Ham. On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!
    
His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
    Would make them capable.- Do not look upon m
e,
    Lest with this piteous action you convert
    My stern effects. Then what I have to do
   
 Will want true colour- tears perchance for blood.
  Queen. To whom do you speak this?
  Ham. Do y
ou see nothing there?
  Queen. Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
  Ham. Nor did you nothing h
ear?
  Queen. No, nothing but ourselves.
  Ham. Why, look you there! Look how it steals away!
   
 My father, in his habit as he liv'd!
    Look where he goes even now out at the portal!
         
                                            Exit Ghost.
  Queen. This is the very coinage of your b
rain.
    This bodiless creation ecstasy
    Is very cunning in.
  Ham. Ecstasy?
    My pulse as
 yours doth temperately keep time
    And makes as healthful music. It is not madness
    That I h
ave utt'red. Bring me to the test,
    And I the matter will reword; which madness
    Would gambo
l from. Mother, for love of grace,
    Lay not that flattering unction to your soul
    That not y
our trespass but my madness speaks.
    It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
    Whiles r
ank corruption, mining all within,
    Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
    Repent what
's past; avoid what is to come;
    And do not spread the compost on the weeds
    To make them ra
nker. Forgive me this my virtue;
    For in the fatness of these pursy times
    Virtue itself of 
vice must pardon beg-
    Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.
  Queen. O Hamlet, thou hast
 cleft my heart in twain.
  Ham. O, throw away the worser part of it,
    And live the purer with 
the other half,
    Good night- but go not to my uncle's bed.
    Assume a virtue, if you have it 
not.
    That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat
    Of habits evil, is angel yet in this,
 
   That to the use of actions fair and good
    He likewise gives a frock or livery,
    That aptl
y is put on. Refrain to-night,
    And that shall lend a kind of easiness
    To the next abstinen
ce; the next more easy;
    For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
    And either [master]
 the devil, or throw him out
    With wondrous potency. Once more, good night;
    And when you ar
e desirous to be blest,
    I'll blessing beg of you.- For this same lord,
    I do repent; but he
aven hath pleas'd it so,
    To punish me with this, and this with me,
    That I must be their sc
ourge and minister.
    I will bestow him, and will answer well
    The death I gave him. So again
, good night.
    I must be cruel, only to be kind;
    Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.

    One word more, good lady.
  Queen. What shall I do?
  Ham. Not this, by no means, that I bid
 you do:
    Let the bloat King tempt you again to bed;
    Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you h
is mouse;
    And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
    Or paddling in your neck with his damn
'd fingers,
    Make you to ravel all this matter out,
    That I essentially am not in madness,

    But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;
    For who that's but a queen, fair, sober, wi
se,
    Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib
    Such dear concernings hide? Who would do so?

    No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
    Unpeg the basket on the house's top,
    Let the bird
s fly, and like the famous ape,
    To try conclusions, in the basket creep
    And break your own
 neck down.
  Queen. Be thou assur'd, if words be made of breath,
    And breath of life, I have n
o life to breathe
    What thou hast said to me.
  Ham. I must to England; you know that?
  Queen
. Alack,
    I had forgot! 'Tis so concluded on.
  Ham. There's letters seal'd; and my two schoolf
ellows,
    Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,
    They bear the mandate; they must sweep 
my way
    And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
    For 'tis the sport to have the enginer
   
 Hoist with his own petar; and 't shall go hard
    But I will delve one yard below their mines
  
  And blow them at the moon. O, 'tis most sweet
    When in one line two crafts directly meet.
   
 This man shall set me packing.
    I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.-
    Mother, good n
ight.- Indeed, this counsellor
    Is now most still, most secret, and most grave,
    Who was in 
life a foolish peating knave.
    Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.
    Good night, mothe
r.
                  [Exit the Queen. Then] Exit Hamlet, tugging in
                              
                         Polonius.

ACT IV. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the Ca
stle.

Enter King and Queen, with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  King. There's matter in these
 sighs. These profound heaves
    You must translate; 'tis fit we understand them.
    Where is yo
ur son?
  Queen. Bestow this place on us a little while.
                          [Exeunt Rosencr
antz and Guildenstern.]
    Ah, mine own lord, what have I seen to-night!
  King. What, Gertrude? 
How does Hamlet?
  Queen. Mad as the sea and wind when both contend
    Which is the mightier. In 
his lawless fit
    Behind the arras hearing something stir,
    Whips out his rapier, cries 'A ra
t, a rat!'
    And in this brainish apprehension kills
    The unseen good old man.
  King. O hea
vy deed!
    It had been so with us, had we been there.
    His liberty is full of threats to all-

    To you yourself, to us, to every one.
    Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
    
It will be laid to us, whose providence
    Should have kept short, restrain'd, and out of haunt
 
   This mad young man. But so much was our love
    We would not understand what was most fit,
   
 But, like the owner of a foul disease,
    To keep it from divulging, let it feed
    Even on the
 pith of life. Where is he gone?
  Queen. To draw apart the body he hath kill'd;
    O'er whom his
 very madness, like some ore
    Among a mineral of metals base,
    Shows itself pure. He weeps f
or what is done.
  King. O Gertrude, come away!
    The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch
 
   But we will ship him hence; and this vile deed
    We must with all our majesty and skill
    B
oth countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!

             Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.


    Friends both, go join you with some further aid.
    Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
 
   And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him.
    Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the
 body
    Into the chapel. I pray you haste in this.
                          Exeunt [Rosencrantz
 and Guildenstern].
    Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends
    And let them know bot
h what we mean to do
    And what's untimely done. [So haply slander-]
    Whose whisper o'er the 
world's diameter,
    As level as the cannon to his blank,
    Transports his poisoned shot- may m
iss our name
    And hit the woundless air.- O, come away!
    My soul is full of discord and dism
ay.
                                                         Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. 
A passage in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Safely stow'd.
  Gentlemen. (within) Hamlet! Lo
rd Hamlet!
  Ham. But soft! What noise? Who calls on Hamlet? O, here they
come.

               
Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Ros. What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
  Ha
m. Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
  Ros. Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence

    And bear it to the chapel.
  Ham. Do not believe it.
  Ros. Believe what?
  Ham. That I can
 keep your counsel, and not mine own. Besides,
to be
    demanded of a sponge, what replication sh
ould be made by the
son
    of a king?
  Ros. Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
  Ham. Ay, sir;
 that soaks up the King's countenance, his
rewards,
    his authorities. But such officers do the 
King best service
in
    the end. He keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his
jaw;
    firs
t mouth'd, to be last swallowed. When he needs what you
have
    glean'd, it is but squeezing you 
and, sponge, you shall be
dry
    again.
  Ros. I understand you not, my lord.
  Ham. I am glad 
of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.
  Ros. My lord, you must tell us where the body is
 and go with us
to
    the King.
  Ham. The body is with the King, but the King is not with the

body.
    The King is a thing-
  Guil. A thing, my lord?
  Ham. Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide
 fox, and all after.
                                                         Exeunt.




Scen
e III.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King.

  King. I have sent to seek him and to fin
d the body.
    How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
    Yet must not we put the strong l
aw on him.
    He's lov'd of the distracted multitude,
    Who like not in their judgment, but the
ir eyes;
    And where 'tis so, th' offender's scourge is weigh'd,
    But never the offence. To b
ear all smooth and even,
    This sudden sending him away must seem
    Deliberate pause. Diseases
 desperate grown
    By desperate appliance are reliev'd,
    Or not at all.

                  
  Enter Rosencrantz.

    How now O What hath befall'n?
  Ros. Where the dead body is bestow'd, m
y lord,
    We cannot get from him.
  King. But where is he?
  Ros. Without, my lord; guarded, to
 know your pleasure.
  King. Bring him before us.
  Ros. Ho, Guildenstern! Bring in my lord.

  
      Enter Hamlet and Guildenstern [with Attendants].

  King. Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
  
Ham. At supper.
  King. At supper? Where?
  Ham. Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A certa
in
    convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your worm is
your
    only emperor for diet.
 We fat all creatures else to fat us,
and
    we fat ourselves for maggots. Your fat king and your
 lean
beggar
    is but variable service- two dishes, but to one table. That's
the
    end.
  K
ing. Alas, alas!
  Ham. A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and
eat
    of the 
fish that hath fed of that worm.
  King. What dost thou mean by this?
  Ham. Nothing but to show y
ou how a king may go a progress
through
    the guts of a beggar.
  King. Where is Polonius?
  H
am. In heaven. Send thither to see. If your messenger find him
not
    there, seek him i' th' othe
r place yourself. But indeed, if
you
    find him not within this month, you shall nose him as you
 go
up
    the stair, into the lobby.
  King. Go seek him there. [To Attendants.]
  Ham. He will
 stay till you come.
                                            [Exeunt Attendants.]
  King. Haml
et, this deed, for thine especial safety,-
    Which we do tender as we dearly grieve
    For that
 which thou hast done,- must send thee hence
    With fiery quickness. Therefore prepare thyself.

    The bark is ready and the wind at help,
    Th' associates tend, and everything is bent
    Fo
r England.
  Ham. For England?
  King. Ay, Hamlet.
  Ham. Good.
  King. So is it, if thou knew's
t our purposes.
  Ham. I see a cherub that sees them. But come, for England!
    Farewell, dear mo
ther.
  King. Thy loving father, Hamlet.
  Ham. My mother! Father and mother is man and wife; man 
and wife
is
    one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England!
Exit.
  King. Follow him at foo
t; tempt him with speed aboard.
    Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night.
    Away! for ever
ything is seal'd and done
    That else leans on th' affair. Pray you make haste.
                
            Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]
    And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught
,-
    As my great power thereof may give thee sense,
    Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and re
d
    After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
    Pays homage to us,- thou mayst not coldly set

    Our sovereign process, which imports at full,
    By letters congruing to that effect,
    The
 present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;
    For like the hectic in my blood he rages,
    And th
ou must cure me. Till I know 'tis done,
    Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.             
Exit.

Scene IV.
Near Elsinore.

Enter Fortinbras with his Army over the stag
e.

  For. Go, Captain, from me greet the Danish king.
    Tell him that by his license Fortinbra
s
    Craves the conveyance of a promis'd march
    Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.
  
  If that his Majesty would aught with us,
    We shall express our duty in his eye;
    And let h
im know so.
  Capt. I will do't, my lord.
  For. Go softly on.
                                  
 Exeunt [all but the Captain].

       Enter Hamlet, Rosencrantz, [Guildenstern,] and others.

 
 Ham. Good sir, whose powers are these?
  Capt. They are of Norway, sir.
  Ham. How purpos'd, sir,
 I pray you?
  Capt. Against some part of Poland.
  Ham. Who commands them, sir?
  Capt. The neph
ew to old Norway, Fortinbras.
  Ham. Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
    Or for some fron
tier?
  Capt. Truly to speak, and with no addition,
    We go to gain a little patch of ground
  
  That hath in it no profit but the name.
    To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
    N
or will it yield to Norway or the Pole
    A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
  Ham. Why, th
en the Polack never will defend it.
  Capt. Yes, it is already garrison'd.
  Ham. Two thousand sou
ls and twenty thousand ducats
    Will not debate the question of this straw.
    This is th' impo
sthume of much wealth and peace,
    That inward breaks, and shows no cause without
    Why the ma
n dies.- I humbly thank you, sir.
  Capt. God b' wi' you, sir.                             [Exit.]

  Ros. Will't please you go, my lord?
  Ham. I'll be with you straight. Go a little before.
     
                                   [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]
    How all occasions do inform against
 me
    And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
    If his chief good and market of his time
   
 Be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.
    Sure he that made us with such large discourse,
 
   Looking before and after, gave us not
    That capability and godlike reason
    To fust in us 
unus'd. Now, whether it be
    Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple
    Of thinking too precis
ely on th' event,-
    A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
    And ever three par
ts coward,- I do not know
    Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do,'
    Sith I have cause, a
nd will, and strength, and means
    To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me.
    Witness this 
army of such mass and charge,
    Led by a delicate and tender prince,
    Whose spirit, with divi
ne ambition puff'd,
    Makes mouths at the invisible event,
    Exposing what is mortal and unsur
e
    To all that fortune, death, and danger dare,
    Even for an eggshell. Rightly to be great

    Is not to stir without great argument,
    But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
    When hon
our's at the stake. How stand I then,
    That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,
    Excitem
ents of my reason and my blood,
    And let all sleep, while to my shame I see
    The imminent de
ath of twenty thousand men
    That for a fantasy and trick of fame
    Go to their graves like be
ds, fight for a plot
    Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
    Which is not tomb enough an
d continent
    To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,
    My thoughts be bloody, or be nothi
ng worth!            Exit.

Scene V.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter H
oratio, Queen, and a Gentleman.

  Queen. I will not speak with her.
  Gent. She is importunate, 
indeed distract.
    Her mood will needs be pitied.
  Queen. What would she have?
  Gent. She spe
aks much of her father; says she hears
    There's tricks i' th' world, and hems, and beats her hea
rt;
    Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,
    That carry but half sense. Her spe
ech is nothing,
    Yet the unshaped use of it doth move
    The hearers to collection; they aim a
t it,
    And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;
    Which, as her winks and nods and g
estures yield them,
    Indeed would make one think there might be thought,
    Though nothing sur
e, yet much unhappily.
  Hor. 'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew
    Dangerous co
njectures in ill-breeding minds.
  Queen. Let her come in.
                                       
        [Exit Gentleman.]
    [Aside] To my sick soul (as sin's true nature is)
    Each toy seems
 Prologue to some great amiss.
    So full of artless jealousy is guilt
    It spills itself in fe
aring to be spilt.

                 Enter Ophelia distracted.

  Oph. Where is the beauteous Ma
jesty of Denmark?
  Queen. How now, Ophelia?
  Oph. (sings)
         How should I your true-love 
know
           From another one?
         By his cockle bat and' staff
           And his sandal
 shoon.

  Queen. Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
  Oph. Say you? Nay, pray You mark.


    (Sings) He is dead and gone, lady,
              He is dead and gone;
            At his hea
d a grass-green turf,
              At his heels a stone.

    O, ho!
  Queen. Nay, but Ophelia-

  Oph. Pray you mark.

    (Sings) White his shroud as the mountain snow-

                   
 Enter King.

  Queen. Alas, look here, my lord!
  Oph. (Sings)
           Larded all with sweet
 flowers;
         Which bewept to the grave did not go
           With true-love showers.

  Ki
ng. How do you, pretty lady?
  Oph. Well, God dild you! They say the owl was a baker's
daughter.

    Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be. God
be at
    your table!
  King. Con
ceit upon her father.
  Oph. Pray let's have no words of this; but when they ask, you
what
    it
 means, say you this:

    (Sings) To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,
              All in the m
orning bedtime,
            And I a maid at your window,
              To be your Valentine.

  
          Then up he rose and donn'd his clo'es
              And dupp'd the chamber door,
       
     Let in the maid, that out a maid
              Never departed more.

  King. Pretty Ophelia!

  Oph. Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't!

    [Sings] By Gis and by Saint Char
ity,
              Alack, and fie for shame!
            Young men will do't if they come to't
  
            By Cock, they are to blame.

            Quoth she, 'Before you tumbled me,
         
     You promis'd me to wed.'

    He answers:

            'So would I 'a' done, by yonder sun,

              An thou hadst not come to my bed.'

  King. How long hath she been thus?
  Oph. I
 hope all will be well. We must be patient; but I cannot
    choose but weep to think they would la
y him i' th' cold
ground.
    My brother shall know of it; and so I thank you for your good
    c
ounsel. Come, my coach! Good night, ladies. Good night,
sweet
    ladies. Good night, good night. 
                        Exit
  King. Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.
          
                                       [Exit Horatio.]

    O, this is the poison of deep grief; i
t springs
    All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
    When sorrows come, they come 
not single spies.
    But in battalions! First, her father slain;
    Next, your son gone, and he 
most violent author
    Of his own just remove; the people muddied,
    Thick and and unwholesome 
in their thoughts and whispers
    For good Polonius' death, and we have done but greenly
    In h
ugger-mugger to inter him; poor Ophelia
    Divided from herself and her fair judgment,
    Withou
t the which we are pictures or mere beasts;
    Last, and as much containing as all these,
    Her
 brother is in secret come from France;
    And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
    Feeds on h
is wonder, keep, himself in clouds,
    With pestilent speeches of his father's death,
    Wherein
 necessity, of matter beggar'd,
    Will nothing stick our person to arraign
    In ear and ear. O
 my dear Gertrude, this,
    Like to a murd'ring piece, in many places
    Give me superfluous dea
th.                  A noise within.
  Queen. Alack, what noise is this?
  King. Where are my Swit
zers? Let them guard the door.

                     Enter a Messenger.

    What is the matter?

  Mess. Save Yourself, my lord:
    The ocean, overpeering of his list,
    Eats not the flats w
ith more impetuous haste
    Than Young Laertes, in a riotous head,
    O'erbears Your offices. Th
e rabble call him lord;
    And, as the world were now but to begin,
    Antiquity forgot, custom 
not known,
    The ratifiers and props of every word,
    They cry 'Choose we! Laertes shall be ki
ng!'
    Caps, hands, and tongues applaud it to the clouds,
    'Laertes shall be king! Laertes ki
ng!'
                                                 A noise within.
  Queen. How cheerfully on t
he false trail they cry!
    O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!
  King. The doors are brok
e.

                    Enter Laertes with others.

  Laer. Where is this king?- Sirs, staid you
 all without.
  All. No, let's come in!
  Laer. I pray you give me leave.
  All. We will, we will
!
  Laer. I thank you. Keep the door.      [Exeunt his Followers.]
    O thou vile king,
    Give
 me my father!
  Queen. Calmly, good Laertes.
  Laer. That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me 
bastard;
    Cries cuckold to my father; brands the harlot
    Even here between the chaste unsmir
ched brows
    Of my true mother.
  King. What is the cause, Laertes,
    That thy rebellion look
s so giantlike?
    Let him go, Gertrude. Do not fear our person.
    There's such divinity doth h
edge a king
    That treason can but peep to what it would,
    Acts little of his will. Tell me, 
Laertes,
    Why thou art thus incens'd. Let him go, Gertrude.
    Speak, man.
  Laer. Where is m
y father?
  King. Dead.
  Queen. But not by him!
  King. Let him demand his fill.
  Laer. How ca
me he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
    To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil
    Con
science and grace, to the profoundest pit!
    I dare damnation. To this point I stand,
    That b
oth the world, I give to negligence,
    Let come what comes; only I'll be reveng'd
    Most throu
ghly for my father.
  King. Who shall stay you?
  Laer. My will, not all the world!
    And for m
y means, I'll husband them so well
    They shall go far with little.
  King. Good Laertes,
    I
f you desire to know the certainty
    Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge
    
That sweepstake you will draw both friend and foe,
    Winner and loser?
  Laer. None but his enem
ies.
  King. Will you know them then?
  Laer. To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms
    
And, like the kind life-rend'ring pelican,
    Repast them with my blood.
  King. Why, now You spe
ak
    Like a good child and a true gentleman.
    That I am guiltless of your father's death,
  
  And am most sensibly in grief for it,
    It shall as level to your judgment pierce
    As day d
oes to your eye.
                              A noise within: 'Let her come in.'
  Laer. How now?
 What noise is that?

                      Enter Ophelia.

    O heat, dry up my brains! Tears 
seven times salt
    Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!
    By heaven, thy madness shall b
e paid by weight
    Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!
    Dear maid, kind sister, swee
t Ophelia!
    O heavens! is't possible a young maid's wits
    Should be as mortal as an old man'
s life?
    Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,
    It sends some precious instance of it
self
    After the thing it loves.

  Oph. (sings)
         They bore him barefac'd on the bier

           (Hey non nony, nony, hey nony)
         And in his grave rain'd many a tear.

    Far
e you well, my dove!
  Laer. Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
    It could not mov
e thus.
  Oph. You must sing 'A-down a-down, and you call him a-down-a.'
O,
    how the wheel bec
omes it! It is the false steward, that stole
his
    master's daughter.
  Laer. This nothing's mo
re than matter.
  Oph. There's rosemary, that's for remembrance. Pray you, love,
    remember. And
 there is pansies, that's for thoughts.
  Laer. A document in madness! Thoughts and remembrance fit
ted.
  Oph. There's fennel for you, and columbines. There's rue for
you,
    and here's some for 
me. We may call it herb of grace o'
Sundays.
    O, you must wear your rue with a difference! Ther
e's a daisy.
I
    would give you some violets, but they wither'd all when my
father
    died. T
hey say he made a good end.

    [Sings] For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.

  Laer. Thought a
nd affliction, passion, hell itself,
    She turns to favour and to prettiness.
  Oph. (sings)
  
       And will he not come again?
         And will he not come again?
           No, no, he is d
ead;
           Go to thy deathbed;
         He never will come again.

         His beard was a
s white as snow,
         All flaxen was his poll.
           He is gone, he is gone,
           
And we cast away moan.
         God 'a'mercy on his soul!

    And of all Christian souls, I pray
 God. God b' wi' you.
Exit.
  Laer. Do you see this, O God?
  King. Laertes, I must commune with 
your grief,
    Or you deny me right. Go but apart,
    Make choice of whom your wisest friends yo
u will,
    And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me.
    If by direct or by collateral han
d
    They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,
    Our crown, our life, and all that we cal
l ours,
    To you in satisfaction; but if not,
    Be you content to lend your patience to us,
 
   And we shall jointly labour with your soul
    To give it due content.
  Laer. Let this be so.

    His means of death, his obscure funeral-
    No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,

    No noble rite nor formal ostentation,-
    Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
  
  That I must call't in question.
  King. So you shall;
    And where th' offence is let the great
 axe fall.
    I pray you go with me.
                                                          Ex
eunt

Scene VI.
Elsinore. Another room in the Castle.

Enter Horatio with an 
Attendant.

  Hor. What are they that would speak with me?
  Servant. Seafaring men, sir. They sa
y they have letters for
you.
  Hor. Let them come in.
                                           
    [Exit Attendant.]
    I do not know from what part of the world
    I should be greeted, if no
t from Lord Hamlet.

                          Enter Sailors.

  Sailor. God bless you, sir.
  
Hor. Let him bless thee too.
  Sailor. 'A shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter for
you,

    sir,- it comes from th' ambassador that was bound for
England- if
    your name be Horatio, as
 I am let to know it is.
  Hor. (reads the letter) 'Horatio, when thou shalt have
overlook'd
    
this, give these fellows some means to the King. They have
    letters for him. Ere we were two day
s old at sea, a pirate of

    very warlike appointment gave us chase. Finding ourselves too
    
slow of sail, we put on a compelled valour, and in the
grapple I
    boarded them. On the instant 
they got clear of our ship; so I
    alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with me like
thi
eves
    of mercy; but they knew what they did: I am to do a good turn
for
    them. Let the King
 have the letters I have sent, and repair
thou
    to me with as much speed as thou wouldst fly de
ath. I have
words
    to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb; yet are they much
too
    light
 for the bore of the matter. These good fellows will
bring
    thee where I am. Rosencrantz and Gu
ildenstern hold their
course
    for England. Of them I have much to tell thee. Farewell.
       
                     'He that thou knowest thine, HAMLET.'

    Come, I will give you way for thes
e your letters,
    And do't the speedier that you may direct me
    To him from whom you brought 
them.                   Exeunt.

Scene VII.
Elsinore. Another room in the Castl
e.

Enter King and Laertes.

  King. Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
    And You 
must put me in your heart for friend,
    Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
    That he
 which hath your noble father slain
    Pursued my life.
  Laer. It well appears. But tell me
   
 Why you proceeded not against these feats
    So crimeful and so capital in nature,
    As by you
r safety, wisdom, all things else,
    You mainly were stirr'd up.
  King. O, for two special reas
ons,
    Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,
    But yet to me they are strong. The Qu
een his mother
    Lives almost by his looks; and for myself,-
    My virtue or my plague, be it e
ither which,-
    She's so conjunctive to my life and soul
    That, as the star moves not but in 
his sphere,
    I could not but by her. The other motive
    Why to a public count I might not go

    Is the great love the general gender bear him,
    Who, dipping all his faults in their affect
ion,
    Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
    Convert his gives to graces; so th
at my arrows,
    Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,
    Would have reverted to my bow agai
n,
    And not where I had aim'd them.
  Laer. And so have I a noble father lost;
    A sister dr
iven into desp'rate terms,
    Whose worth, if praises may go back again,
    Stood challenger on 
mount of all the age
    For her perfections. But my revenge will come.
  King. Break not your sle
eps for that. You must not think
    That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
    That we can le
t our beard be shook with danger,
    And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more.
    I lov
'd your father, and we love ourself,
    And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine-

          
       Enter a Messenger with letters.

    How now? What news?
  Mess. Letters, my lord, from Ha
mlet:
    This to your Majesty; this to the Queen.
  King. From Hamlet? Who brought them?
  Mess.
 Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not.
    They were given me by Claudio; he receiv'd them
 
   Of him that brought them.
  King. Laertes, you shall hear them.
    Leave us.
                
                                 Exit Messenger.
    [Reads]'High and Mighty,-You shall know I am s
et naked on
your
    kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes;
    when I sha
ll (first asking your pardon thereunto) recount the
    occasion of my sudden and more strange retu
rn.
                                                     'HAMLET.'
    What should this mean? Are 
all the rest come back?
    Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?
  Laer. Know you the hand?
  
King. 'Tis Hamlet's character. 'Naked!'
    And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'
    Can you
 advise me?
  Laer. I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come!
    It warms the very sickness in 
my heart
    That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,
    'Thus didest thou.'
  King. If it b
e so, Laertes
    (As how should it be so? how otherwise?),
    Will you be rul'd by me?
  Laer. 
Ay my lord,
    So you will not o'errule me to a peace.
  King. To thine own peace. If he be now r
eturn'd
    As checking at his voyage, and that he means
    No more to undertake it, I will work 
him
    To exploit now ripe in my device,
    Under the which he shall not choose but fall;
    A
nd for his death no wind shall breathe
    But even his mother shall uncharge the practice
    And
 call it accident.
  Laer. My lord, I will be rul'd;
    The rather, if you could devise it so
  
  That I might be the organ.
  King. It falls right.
    You have been talk'd of since your travel
 much,
    And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality
    Wherein they say you shine, Your sum of
 parts
    Did not together pluck such envy from him
    As did that one; and that, in my regard,

    Of the unworthiest siege.
  Laer. What part is that, my lord?
  King. A very riband in the ca
p of youth-
    Yet needfull too; for youth no less becomes
    The light and careless livery that
 it wears
    Than settled age his sables and his weeds,
    Importing health and graveness. Two m
onths since
    Here was a gentleman of Normandy.
    I have seen myself, and serv'd against, the 
French,
    And they can well on horseback; but this gallant
    Had witchcraft in't. He grew unto
 his seat,
    And to such wondrous doing brought his horse
    As had he been incorps'd and demi-
natur'd
    With the brave beast. So far he topp'd my thought
    That I, in forgery of shapes and
 tricks,
    Come short of what he did.
  Laer. A Norman was't?
  King. A Norman.
  Laer. Upon m
y life, Lamound.
  King. The very same.
  Laer. I know him well. He is the broach indeed
    And 
gem of all the nation.
  King. He made confession of you;
    And gave you such a masterly report

    For art and exercise in your defence,
    And for your rapier most especially,
    That he cr
ied out 'twould be a sight indeed
    If one could match you. The scrimers of their nation
    He 
swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
    If you oppos'd them. Sir, this report of his
    Did
 Hamlet so envenom with his envy
    That he could nothing do but wish and beg
    Your sudden com
ing o'er to play with you.
    Now, out of this-
  Laer. What out of this, my lord?
  King. Laert
es, was your father dear to you?
    Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
    A face without 
a heart,'
  Laer. Why ask you this?
  King. Not that I think you did not love your father;
    Bu
t that I know love is begun by time,
    And that I see, in passages of proof,
    Time qualifies 
the spark and fire of it.
    There lives within the very flame of love
    A kind of wick or snuf
f that will abate it;
    And nothing is at a like goodness still;
    For goodness, growing to a 
plurisy,
    Dies in his own too-much. That we would do,
    We should do when we would; for this 
'would' changes,
    And hath abatements and delays as many
    As there are tongues, are hands, a
re accidents;
    And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
    That hurts by easing. But
 to the quick o' th' ulcer!
    Hamlet comes back. What would you undertake
    To show yourself y
our father's son in deed
    More than in words?
  Laer. To cut his throat i' th' church!
  King.
 No place indeed should murther sanctuarize;
    Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,

    Will you do this? Keep close within your chamber.
    Hamlet return'd shall know you are come 
home.
    We'll put on those shall praise your excellence
    And set a double varnish on the fame

    The Frenchman gave you; bring you in fine together
    And wager on your heads. He, being rem
iss,
    Most generous, and free from all contriving,
    Will not peruse the foils; so that with 
ease,
    Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
    A sword unbated, and, in a pass of practi
ce,
    Requite him for your father.
  Laer. I will do't!
    And for that purpose I'll anoint my
 sword.
    I bought an unction of a mountebank,
    So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
    W
here it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
    Collected from all simples that have virtue
    Unde
r the moon, can save the thing from death
    This is but scratch'd withal. I'll touch my point
  
  With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
    It may be death.
  King. Let's further th
ink of this,
    Weigh what convenience both of time and means
    May fit us to our shape. If thi
s should fall,
    And that our drift look through our bad performance.
    'Twere better not assa
y'd. Therefore this project
    Should have a back or second, that might hold
    If this did blas
t in proof. Soft! let me see.
    We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings-
    I ha't!
    Whe
n in your motion you are hot and dry-
    As make your bouts more violent to that end-
    And tha
t he calls for drink, I'll have prepar'd him
    A chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,
   
 If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
    Our purpose may hold there.- But stay, what noise,


                           Enter Queen.

    How now, sweet queen?
  Queen. One woe doth tread
 upon another's heel,
    So fast they follow. Your sister's drown'd, Laertes.
  Laer. Drown'd! O,
 where?
  Queen. There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
    That shows his hoar leaves in the gla
ssy stream.
    There with fantastic garlands did she come
    Of crowflowers, nettles, daisies, a
nd long purples,
    That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
    But our cold maids do dead me
n's fingers call them.
    There on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds
    Clamb'ring to hang, a
n envious sliver broke,
    When down her weedy trophies and herself
    Fell in the weeping brook
. Her clothes spread wide
    And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up;
    Which time she chaun
ted snatches of old tunes,
    As one incapable of her own distress,
    Or like a creature native
 and indued
    Unto that element; but long it could not be
    Till that her garments, heavy with
 their drink,
    Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay
    To muddy death.
  Laer. Alas,
 then she is drown'd?
  Queen. Drown'd, drown'd.
  Laer. Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia
,
    And therefore I forbid my tears; but yet
    It is our trick; nature her custom holds,
    
Let shame say what it will. When these are gone,
    The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord.
    I 
have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze
    But that this folly douts it.                     
     Exit.
  King. Let's follow, Gertrude.
    How much I had to do to calm his rage I
    Now fe
ar I this will give it start again;
    Therefore let's follow.
                                  
                       Exeunt.

ACT V. Scene I.
Elsinore. A churchyard.

Ente
r two Clowns, [with spades and pickaxes].

  Clown. Is she to be buried in Christian burial when s
he
wilfully
    seeks her own salvation?
  Other. I tell thee she is; therefore make her grave st
raight.
    The crowner hath sate on her, and finds it Christian burial.
  Clown. How can that be,
 unless she drown'd herself in her own
    defence?
  Other. Why, 'tis found so.
  Clown. It must
 be se offendendo; it cannot be else. For here
lies
    the point: if I drown myself wittingly, it
 argues an act; and
an
    act hath three branches-it is to act, to do, and to perform;
    argal
, she drown'd herself wittingly.
  Other. Nay, but hear you, Goodman Delver!
  Clown. Give me leav
e. Here lies the water; good. Here stands
the
    man; good. If the man go to this water and drown
 himself, it
is,
    will he nill he, he goes- mark you that. But if the water
come to
    him a
nd drown him, he drowns not himself. Argal, he that is
not
    guilty of his own death shortens no
t his own life.
  Other. But is this law?
  Clown. Ay, marry, is't- crowner's quest law.
  Other.
 Will you ha' the truth an't? If this had not been a
    gentlewoman, she should have been buried o
ut o' Christian
burial.
  Clown. Why, there thou say'st! And the more pity that great
folk
    s
hould have count'nance in this world to drown or hang
themselves
    more than their even-Christia
n. Come, my spade! There is no
    ancient gentlemen but gard'ners, ditchers, and grave-makers.
Th
ey
    hold up Adam's profession.
  Other. Was he a gentleman?
  Clown. 'A was the first that eve
r bore arms.
  Other. Why, he had none.
  Clown. What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the

Scripture?
    The Scripture says Adam digg'd. Could he dig without arms?
I'll
    put another 
question to thee. If thou answerest me not to the
    purpose, confess thyself-
  Other. Go to!
 
 Clown. What is he that builds stronger than either the mason,
the
    shipwright, or the carpente
r?
  Other. The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand
    tenants.
  Clown. I like th
y wit well, in good faith. The gallows does
well.
    But how does it well? It does well to those 
that do ill. Now,
    thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the
    church. Arga
l, the gallows may do well to thee. To't again,
come!
  Other. Who builds stronger than a mason, a
 shipwright, or a
    carpenter?
  Clown. Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
  Other. Marry, now I can
 tell!
  Clown. To't.
  Other. Mass, I cannot tell.

                 Enter Hamlet and Horatio a
far off.

  Clown. Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull ass
will
    not mend his p
ace with beating; and when you are ask'd this
    question next, say 'a grave-maker.' The houses he
 makes lasts
    till doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan; fetch me a stoup of
    liquor.
        
                                    [Exit Second Clown.]


                       [Clown digs and
] sings.

       In youth when I did love, did love,
         Methought it was very sweet;
     
  To contract- O- the time for- a- my behove,
         O, methought there- a- was nothing- a- meet.


  Ham. Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings
at
    grave-making?
  Hor. 
Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.
  Ham. 'Tis e'en so. The hand of little employme
nt hath the
daintier
    sense.
  Clown. (sings)
         But age with his stealing steps
     
      Hath clawed me in his clutch,
         And hath shipped me intil the land,
           As if 
I had never been such.
                                            [Throws up a skull.]

  Ham. T
hat skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once. How
the
    knave jowls it to the ground,as if 
'twere Cain's jawbone,
that
    did the first murther! This might be the pate of a
Politician,
 
   which this ass now o'erreaches; one that would circumvent
God,
    might it not?
  Hor. It mig
ht, my lord.
  Ham. Or of a courtier, which could say 'Good morrow, sweet
lord!
    How dost thou
, good lord?' This might be my Lord Such-a-one,
that
    prais'd my Lord Such-a-one's horse when h
e meant to beg it-
might
    it not?
  Hor. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Why, e'en so! and now my Lady Wo
rm's, chapless, and
knock'd
    about the mazzard with a sexton's spade. Here's fine
revolution,

    and we had the trick to see't. Did these bones cost no more
the
    breeding but to play at l
oggets with 'em? Mine ache to think
    on't.
  Clown. (Sings)
         A pickaxe and a spade, a 
spade,
           For and a shrouding sheet;
         O, a Pit of clay for to be made
           
For such a guest is meet.
                                      Throws up [another skull].

  Ham
. There's another. Why may not that be the skull of a
lawyer?
    Where be his quiddits now, his q
uillets, his cases, his
tenures,
    and his tricks? Why does he suffer this rude knave now to
kn
ock
    him about the sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell
him
    of his action of batt
ery? Hum! This fellow might be in's time
a
    great buyer of land, with his statutes, his recogni
zances,
his
    fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries. Is this the fine
of
    his fines, a
nd the recovery of his recoveries, to have his
fine
    pate full of fine dirt? Will his vouchers 
vouch him no more
of
    his purchases, and double ones too, than the length and
breadth
    of 
a pair of indentures? The very conveyances of his lands
will
    scarcely lie in this box; and mus
t th' inheritor himself have
no
    more, ha?
  Hor. Not a jot more, my lord.
  Ham. Is not parc
hment made of sheepskins?
  Hor. Ay, my lord, And of calveskins too.
  Ham. They are sheep and cal
ves which seek out assurance in
that. I
    will speak to this fellow. Whose grave's this, sirrah?

  Clown. Mine, sir.

    [Sings] O, a pit of clay for to be made
              For such a guest
 is meet.

  Ham. I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in't.
  Clown. You lie out on't, sir
, and therefore 'tis not yours.
    For my part, I do not lie in't, yet it is mine.
  Ham. Thou do
st lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine. 'Tis
for
    the dead, not for the quick; therefore t
hou liest.
  Clown. 'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away again from me to you.
  Ham. What man dost 
thou dig it for?
  Clown. For no man, sir.
  Ham. What woman then?
  Clown. For none neither.
  
Ham. Who is to be buried in't?
  Clown. One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's
dead.

  Ham. How absolute the knave is! We must speak by the card, or
    equivocation will undo us. By
 the Lord, Horatio, this three
years
    I have taken note of it, the age is grown so picked that 
the
toe
    of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he
galls
    his kibe.- How lo
ng hast thou been a grave-maker?
  Clown. Of all the days i' th' year, I came to't that day that
o
ur
    last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.
  Ham. How long is that since?
  Clown. Cannot you t
ell that? Every fool can tell that. It was
the
    very day that young Hamlet was born- he that is
 mad, and sent
    into England.
  Ham. Ay, marry, why was be sent into England?
  Clown. Why, be
cause 'a was mad. 'A shall recover his wits
there;
    or, if 'a do not, 'tis no great matter ther
e.
  Ham. Why?
  Clown. 'Twill not he seen in him there. There the men are as
mad as
    he.
  
Ham. How came he mad?
  Clown. Very strangely, they say.
  Ham. How strangely?
  Clown. Faith, e'
en with losing his wits.
  Ham. Upon what ground?
  Clown. Why, here in Denmark. I have been sexto
n here, man and
boy
    thirty years.
  Ham. How long will a man lie i' th' earth ere he rot?
  
Clown. Faith, if 'a be not rotten before 'a die (as we have
many
    pocky corses now-a-days that 
will scarce hold the laying in,
I
    will last you some eight year or nine year. A tanner will
l
ast
    you nine year.
  Ham. Why he more than another?
  Clown. Why, sir, his hide is so tann'd 
with his trade that 'a
will
    keep out water a great while; and your water is a sore
decayer of

    your whoreson dead body. Here's a skull now. This skull hath
lien
    you i' th' earth three
-and-twenty years.
  Ham. Whose was it?
  Clown. A whoreson, mad fellow's it was. Whose do you thi
nk it
was?
  Ham. Nay, I know not.
  Clown. A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! 'A pour'd a flag
on
of
    Rhenish on my head once. This same skull, sir, was Yorick's
    skull, the King's jeste
r.
  Ham. This?
  Clown. E'en that.
  Ham. Let me see. [Takes the skull.] Alas, poor Yorick! I kn
ew
him,
    Horatio. A fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy.
He
    hath borne me on
 his back a thousand times. And now how
abhorred
    in my imagination it is! My gorge rises at it
. Here hung
those
    lips that I have kiss'd I know not how oft. Where be your
gibes
    now? y
our gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment that
    were wont to set the table on a roar? N
ot one now, to mock
your
    own grinning? Quite chap- fall'n? Now get you to my lady's
    chamb
er, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this
    favour she must come. Make her laugh at 
that. Prithee,
Horatio,
    tell me one thing.
  Hor. What's that, my lord?
  Ham. Dost thou thi
nk Alexander look'd o' this fashion i' th'
earth?
  Hor. E'en so.
  Ham. And smelt so? Pah!
    
                                      [Puts down the skull.]
  Hor. E'en so, my lord.
  Ham. To wh
at base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not
    imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander 
till he find it
    stopping a bunghole?
  Hor. 'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.

  Ham. No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with
modesty
    enough, and likelihood to
 lead it; as thus: Alexander died,
    Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dus
t
is
    earth; of earth we make loam; and why of that loam (whereto
he
    was converted) might
 they not stop a beer barrel?
    Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
    Might stop a hole
 to keep the wind away.
    O, that that earth which kept the world in awe
    Should patch a wall
 t' expel the winter's flaw!
    But soft! but soft! aside! Here comes the King-

    Enter [prie
sts with] a coffin [in funeral procession], King,
             Queen, Laertes, with Lords attendant
.]

    The Queen, the courtiers. Who is this they follow?
    And with such maimed rites? This d
oth betoken
    The corse they follow did with desp'rate hand
    Fordo it own life. 'Twas of some
 estate.
    Couch we awhile, and mark.
                                         [Retires with Hor
atio.]

  Laer. What ceremony else?
  Ham. That is Laertes,
    A very noble youth. Mark.
  Lae
r. What ceremony else?
  Priest. Her obsequies have been as far enlarg'd
    As we have warranty. 
Her death was doubtful;
    And, but that great command o'ersways the order,
    She should in gro
und unsanctified have lodg'd
    Till the last trumpet. For charitable prayers,
    Shards, flints
, and pebbles should be thrown on her.
    Yet here she is allow'd her virgin rites,
    Her maide
n strewments, and the bringing home
    Of bell and burial.
  Laer. Must there no more be done?
 
 Priest. No more be done.
    We should profane the service of the dead
    To sing a requiem and 
such rest to her
    As to peace-parted souls.
  Laer. Lay her i' th' earth;
    And from her fai
r and unpolluted flesh
    May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,
    A minist'ring ang
el shall my sister be
    When thou liest howling.
  Ham. What, the fair Ophelia?
  Queen. Sweets
 to the sweet! Farewell.
                                             [Scatters flowers.]
    I ho
p'd thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
    I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet mai
d,
    And not have strew'd thy grave.
  Laer. O, treble woe
    Fall ten times treble on that cu
rsed head
    Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
    Depriv'd thee of! Hold off the earth 
awhile,
    Till I have caught her once more in mine arms.
                                       
      Leaps in the grave.
    Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead
    Till of this flat a m
ountain you have made
    T' o'ertop old Pelion or the skyish head
    Of blue Olympus.
  Ham. [c
omes forward] What is he whose grief
    Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow
    Conjur
es the wand'ring stars, and makes them stand
    Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,
    Hamle
t the Dane.                    [Leaps in after Laertes.
  Laer. The devil take thy soul!
         
                                   [Grapples with him].
  Ham. Thou pray'st not well.
    I prithe
e take thy fingers from my throat;
    For, though I am not splenitive and rash,
    Yet have I in
 me something dangerous,
    Which let thy wisdom fear. Hold off thy hand!
  King. Pluck them asun
der.
  Queen. Hamlet, Hamlet!
  All. Gentlemen!
  Hor. Good my lord, be quiet.
             [The
 Attendants part them, and they come out of the
                                                   
      grave.]
  Ham. Why, I will fight with him upon this theme
    Until my eyelids will no longe
r wag.
  Queen. O my son, what theme?
  Ham. I lov'd Ophelia. Forty thousand brothers
    Could n
ot (with all their quantity of love)
    Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?
  King. O, he 
is mad, Laertes.
  Queen. For love of God, forbear him!
  Ham. 'Swounds, show me what thou't do.

    Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?
    Woo't drink up esill? eat a crocod
ile?
    I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?
    To outface me with leaping in her grave?
  
  Be buried quick with her, and so will I.
    And if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
    
Millions of acres on us, till our ground,
    Singeing his pate against the burning zone,
    Make
 Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
    I'll rant as well as thou.
  Queen. This is mere mad
ness;
    And thus a while the fit will work on him.
    Anon, as patient as the female dove
    
When that her golden couplets are disclos'd,
    His silence will sit drooping.
  Ham. Hear you, s
ir!
    What is the reason that you use me thus?
    I lov'd you ever. But it is no matter.
    L
et Hercules himself do what he may,
    The cat will mew, and dog will have his day.
Exit.
  King
. I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.
                                                   Exit
 Horatio.
    [To Laertes] Strengthen your patience in our last night's
speech.
    We'll put the
 matter to the present push.-
    Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.-
    This grave sha
ll have a living monument.
    An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
    Till then in patience ou
r proceeding be.
                                                         Exeunt.




Scene II
.
Elsinore. A hall in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet and Horatio.

  Ham. So much for this, sir; now
 shall you see the other.
    You do remember all the circumstance?
  Hor. Remember it, my lord!

  Ham. Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting
    That would not let me sleep. Methought I l
ay
    Worse than the mutinies in the bilboes. Rashly-
    And prais'd be rashness for it; let us 
know,
    Our indiscretion sometime serves us well
    When our deep plots do pall; and that shoul
d learn us
    There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
    Rough-hew them how we will-
  Hor. Th
at is most certain.
  Ham. Up from my cabin,
    My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
    Gr
op'd I to find out them; had my desire,
    Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew
    To min
e own room again; making so bold
    (My fears forgetting manners) to unseal
    Their grand commi
ssion; where I found, Horatio
    (O royal knavery!), an exact command,
    Larded with many sever
al sorts of reasons,
    Importing Denmark's health, and England's too,
    With, hoo! such bugs a
nd goblins in my life-
    That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
    No, not to stay the findi
ng of the axe,
    My head should be struck off.
  Hor. Is't possible?
  Ham. Here's the commissi
on; read it at more leisure.
    But wilt thou bear me how I did proceed?
  Hor. I beseech you.
 
 Ham. Being thus benetted round with villanies,
    Or I could make a prologue to my brains,
    T
hey had begun the play. I sat me down;
    Devis'd a new commission; wrote it fair.
    I once did
 hold it, as our statists do,
    A baseness to write fair, and labour'd much
    How to forget th
at learning; but, sir, now
    It did me yeoman's service. Wilt thou know
    Th' effect of what I
 wrote?
  Hor. Ay, good my lord.
  Ham. An earnest conjuration from the King,
    As England was 
his faithful tributary,
    As love between them like the palm might flourish,
    As peace should
 still her wheaten garland wear
    And stand a comma 'tween their amities,
    And many such-like
 as's of great charge,
    That, on the view and knowing of these contents,
    Without debatement
 further, more or less,
    He should the bearers put to sudden death,
    Not shriving time allow
'd.
  Hor. How was this seal'd?
  Ham. Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
    I had my father
's signet in my purse,
    Which was the model of that Danish seal;
    Folded the writ up in the 
form of th' other,
    Subscrib'd it, gave't th' impression, plac'd it safely,
    The changeling 
never known. Now, the next day
    Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent
    Thou know's
t already.
  Hor. So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.
  Ham. Why, man, they did make love to 
this employment!
    They are not near my conscience; their defeat
    Does by their own insinuati
on grow.
    'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
    Between the pass and fell incensed poi
nts
    Of mighty opposites.
  Hor. Why, what a king is this!
  Ham. Does it not, thinks't thee, 
stand me now upon-
    He that hath kill'd my king, and whor'd my mother;
    Popp'd in between th
' election and my hopes;
    Thrown out his angle for my proper life,
    And with such coz'nage- 
is't not perfect conscience
    To quit him with this arm? And is't not to be damn'd
    To let th
is canker of our nature come
    In further evil?
  Hor. It must be shortly known to him from Engl
and
    What is the issue of the business there.
  Ham. It will be short; the interim is mine,
  
  And a man's life is no more than to say 'one.'
    But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
    That t
o Laertes I forgot myself,
    For by the image of my cause I see
    The portraiture of his. I'll
 court his favours.
    But sure the bravery of his grief did put me
    Into a tow'ring passion.

  Hor. Peace! Who comes here?

                 Enter young Osric, a courtier.

  Osr. Your lor
dship is right welcome back to Denmark.
  Ham. I humbly thank you, sir. [Aside to Horatio] Dost kno
w this
    waterfly?
  Hor. [aside to Hamlet] No, my good lord.
  Ham. [aside to Horatio] Thy sta
te is the more gracious; for
'tis a
    vice to know him. He hath much land, and fertile. Let a be
ast
be
    lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at the king's mess.
'Tis
    a chough; but, 
as I say, spacious in the possession of dirt.

  Osr. Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure
, I should
impart
    a thing to you from his Majesty.
  Ham. I will receive it, sir, with all di
ligence of spirit. Put
your
    bonnet to his right use. 'Tis for the head.
  Osr. I thank your l
ordship, it is very hot.
  Ham. No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly.
  Osr. It i
s indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
  Ham. But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my
comp
lexion.
  Osr. Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry, as 'twere- I
cannot
    tell how. But, my
 lord, his Majesty bade me signify to you
that
    he has laid a great wager on your head. Sir, th
is is the
matter-
  Ham. I beseech you remember.
                           [Hamlet moves him to 
put on his hat.]
  Osr. Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here
is
    newly c
ome to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute
gentleman,
    full of most excellent differences, o
f very soft society and
    great showing. Indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the
card
    
or calendar of gentry; for you shall find in him the
continent of
    what part a gentleman would 
see.
  Ham. Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you; though, I

    know, to divide him i
nventorially would dozy th' arithmetic
of
    memory, and yet but yaw neither in respect of his qu
ick sail.
    But, in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of
great
    article, and 
his infusion of such dearth and rareness as, to
make
    true diction of him, his semblable is his
 mirror, and who
else
    would trace him, his umbrage, nothing more.
  Osr. Your lordship speaks
 most infallibly of him.
  Ham. The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our
more
  
  rawer breath?
  Osr. Sir?
  Hor [aside to Hamlet] Is't not possible to understand in
another
 
   tongue? You will do't, sir, really.
  Ham. What imports the nomination of this gentleman?
  Osr
. Of Laertes?
  Hor. [aside] His purse is empty already. All's golden words are
    spent.
  Ham.
 Of him, sir.
  Osr. I know you are not ignorant-
  Ham. I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if y
ou did, it would
not
    much approve me. Well, sir?
  Osr. You are not ignorant of what excellen
ce Laertes is-
  Ham. I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in
    excellence; b
ut to know a man well were to know himself.
  Osr. I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputati
on laid on
him
    by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.
  Ham. What's his weapon?
  Osr. Rapier
 and dagger.
  Ham. That's two of his weapons- but well.
  Osr. The King, sir, hath wager'd with h
im six Barbary horses;
    against the which he has impon'd, as I take it, six French
    rapiers 
and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers,
and
    so. Three of the carriages, in faith
, are very dear to fancy,
    very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of
    ve
ry liberal conceit.
  Ham. What call you the carriages?
  Hor. [aside to Hamlet] I knew you must b
e edified by the
margent
    ere you had done.
  Osr. The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
  Ham
. The phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could
    carry cannon by our sides. I would
 it might be hangers till
then.
    But on! Six Barbary horses against six French swords, their
 
   assigns, and three liberal-conceited carriages: that's the
French
    bet against the Danish. W
hy is this all impon'd, as you call
it?
  Osr. The King, sir, hath laid that, in a dozen passes be
tween
    yourself and him, he shall not exceed you three hits; he hath
    laid on twelve for nin
e, and it would come to immediate trial
    if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.
  Ham. Ho
w if I answer no?
  Osr. I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
  Ham. Sir, I wi
ll walk here in the hall. If it please his
Majesty,
    it is the breathing time of day with me. L
et the foils be
    brought, the gentleman willing, and the King hold his
purpose,
    I will win
 for him if I can; if not, I will gain nothing but
my
    shame and the odd hits.
  Osr. Shall I 
redeliver you e'en so?
  Ham. To this effect, sir, after what flourish your nature will.
  Osr. I 
commend my duty to your lordship.
  Ham. Yours, yours. [Exit Osric.] He does well to commend it
  
  himself; there are no tongues else for's turn.
  Hor. This lapwing runs away with the shell on hi
s head.
  Ham. He did comply with his dug before he suck'd it. Thus has
he,
    and many more of 
the same bevy that I know the drossy age
dotes
    on, only got the tune of the time and outward h
abit of
encounter-
    a kind of yesty collection, which carries them through and
    through the
 most fann'd and winnowed opinions; and do but
blow
    them to their trial-the bubbles are out,


                            Enter a Lord.

  Lord. My lord, his Majesty commended him to you by 
young Osric,
who
    brings back to him, that you attend him in the hall. He sends
to
    know i
f your pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you
will
    take longer time.
  Ham. I am con
stant to my purposes; they follow the King's
pleasure.
    If his fitness speaks, mine is ready; n
ow or whensoever,
provided
    I be so able as now.
  Lord. The King and Queen and all are coming
 down.
  Ham. In happy time.
  Lord. The Queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to
  
  Laertes before you fall to play.
  Ham. She well instructs me.
                                 
                   [Exit Lord.]
  Hor. You will lose this wager, my lord.
  Ham. I do not think so
. Since he went into France I have been
in
    continual practice. I shall win at the odds. But th
ou wouldst
not
    think how ill all's here about my heart. But it is no matter.
  Hor. Nay, good
 my lord -
  Ham. It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gaingiving as
    would perhaps trou
ble a woman.
  Hor. If your mind dislike anything, obey it. I will forestall
their
    repair hit
her and say you are not fit.
  Ham. Not a whit, we defy augury; there's a special providence
in
 
   the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not to come; if it
be
    not to come, it will be now
; if it be not now, yet it will
come:
    the readiness is all. Since no man knows aught of what h
e
leaves,
    what is't to leave betimes? Let be.

    Enter King, Queen, Laertes, Osric, and Lo
rds, with other
              Attendants with foils and gauntlets.
               A table and flag
ons of wine on it.

  King. Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
                    [
The King puts Laertes' hand into Hamlet's.]
  Ham. Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong;

    But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.
    This presence knows,
    And you must needs have h
eard, how I am punish'd
    With sore distraction. What I have done
    That might your nature, ho
nour, and exception
    Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
    Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laert
es? Never Hamlet.
    If Hamlet from himself be taken away,
    And when he's not himself does wro
ng Laertes,
    Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
    Who does it, then? His madness. If'
t be so,
    Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
    His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
  
  Sir, in this audience,
    Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd evil
    Free me so far in your mo
st generous thoughts
    That I have shot my arrow o'er the house
    And hurt my brother.
  Laer
. I am satisfied in nature,
    Whose motive in this case should stir me most
    To my revenge. B
ut in my terms of honour
    I stand aloof, and will no reconcilement
    Till by some elder maste
rs of known honour
    I have a voice and precedent of peace
    To keep my name ungor'd. But till
 that time
    I do receive your offer'd love like love,
    And will not wrong it.
  Ham. I embr
ace it freely,
    And will this brother's wager frankly play.
    Give us the foils. Come on.
  
Laer. Come, one for me.
  Ham. I'll be your foil, Laertes. In mine ignorance
    Your skill shall,
 like a star i' th' darkest night,
    Stick fiery off indeed.
  Laer. You mock me, sir.
  Ham. N
o, by this hand.
  King. Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
    You know the wager?

  Ham. Very well, my lord.
    Your Grace has laid the odds o' th' weaker side.
  King. I do not 
fear it, I have seen you both;
    But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.
  Laer. This 
is too heavy; let me see another.
  Ham. This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
      
                                          Prepare to play.
  Osr. Ay, my good lord.
  King. Set me
 the stoups of wine upon that table.
    If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
    Or quit in an
swer of the third exchange,
    Let all the battlements their ordnance fire;
    The King shall dr
ink to Hamlet's better breath,
    And in the cup an union shall he throw
    Richer than that whi
ch four successive kings
    In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;
    And let the kettl
e to the trumpet speak,
    The trumpet to the cannoneer without,
    The cannons to the heavens, 
the heaven to earth,
    'Now the King drinks to Hamlet.' Come, begin.
    And you the judges, bea
r a wary eye.
  Ham. Come on, sir.
  Laer. Come, my lord.                                They play
.
  Ham. One.
  Laer. No.
  Ham. Judgment!
  Osr. A hit, a very palpable hit.
  Laer. Well, aga
in!
  King. Stay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
    Here's to thy health.
         
      [Drum; trumpets sound; a piece goes off [within].
    Give him the cup.
  Ham. I'll play thi
s bout first; set it by awhile.
    Come. (They play.) Another hit. What say you?
  Laer. A touch,
 a touch; I do confess't.
  King. Our son shall win.
  Queen. He's fat, and scant of breath.
    
Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows.
    The Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
  Ham.
 Good madam!
  King. Gertrude, do not drink.
  Queen. I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.      
    Drinks.
  King. [aside] It is the poison'd cup; it is too late.
  Ham. I dare not drink yet, m
adam; by-and-by.
  Queen. Come, let me wipe thy face.
  Laer. My lord, I'll hit him now.
  King. 
I do not think't.
  Laer. [aside] And yet it is almost against my conscience.
  Ham. Come for the 
third, Laertes! You but dally.
    Pray you pass with your best violence;
    I am afeard you make
 a wanton of me.
  Laer. Say you so? Come on.                               Play.
  Osr. Nothing n
either way.
  Laer. Have at you now!
                [Laertes wounds Hamlet; then] in scuffling, t
hey
                    change rapiers, [and Hamlet wounds Laertes].
  King. Part them! They are i
ncens'd.
  Ham. Nay come! again!                         The Queen falls.

  Osr. Look to the Que
en there, ho!
  Hor. They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?
  Osr. How is't, Laertes?
  La
er. Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric.
    I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.

  Ham. How does the Queen?
  King. She sounds to see them bleed.
  Queen. No, no! the drink, the 
drink! O my dear Hamlet!
    The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.                 [Dies.]
  Ham. O
 villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd.
    Treachery! Seek it out.
                                
                [Laertes falls.]
  Laer. It is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain;
    No medici
ne in the world can do thee good.
    In thee there is not half an hour of life.
    The treachero
us instrument is in thy hand,
    Unbated and envenom'd. The foul practice
    Hath turn'd itself 
on me. Lo, here I lie,
    Never to rise again. Thy mother's poison'd.
    I can no more. The King
, the King's to blame.
  Ham. The point envenom'd too?
    Then, venom, to thy work.              
      Hurts the King.
  All. Treason! treason!
  King. O, yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt.

  Ham. Here, thou incestuous, murd'rous, damned Dane,
    Drink off this potion! Is thy union here?

    Follow my mother.                                 King dies.
  Laer. He is justly serv'd.
  
  It is a poison temper'd by himself.
    Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet.
    Mine and
 my father's death come not upon thee,
    Nor thine on me!                                       D
ies.
  Ham. Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.
    I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, ad
ieu!
    You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
    That are but mutes or audience to this
 act,
    Had I but time (as this fell sergeant, Death,
    Is strict in his arrest) O, I could te
ll you-
    But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;
    Thou liv'st; report me and my cause aright
   
 To the unsatisfied.
  Hor. Never believe it.
    I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.
    Her
e's yet some liquor left.
  Ham. As th'art a man,
    Give me the cup. Let go! By heaven, I'll ha'
t.
    O good Horatio, what a wounded name
    (Things standing thus unknown) shall live behind me
!
    If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,
    Absent thee from felicity awhile,
    And in t
his harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
    To tell my story.         [March afar off, and shot wi
thin.]
    What warlike noise is this?
  Osr. Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
 
   To the ambassadors of England gives
    This warlike volley.
  Ham. O, I die, Horatio!
    The
 potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit.
    I cannot live to hear the news from England,
    But
 I do prophesy th' election lights
    On Fortinbras. He has my dying voice.
    So tell him, with
 th' occurrents, more and less,
    Which have solicited- the rest is silence.             Dies.
 
 Hor. Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince,
    And flights of angels sing thee to th
y rest!
                                                 [March within.]
    Why does the drum com
e hither?

    Enter Fortinbras and English Ambassadors, with Drum,
                  Colours, an
d Attendants.

  Fort. Where is this sight?
  Hor. What is it you will see?
    If aught of woe 
or wonder, cease your search.
  Fort. This quarry cries on havoc. O proud Death,
    What feast is
 toward in thine eternal cell
    That thou so many princes at a shot
    So bloodily hast struck.

  Ambassador. The sight is dismal;
    And our affairs from England come too late.
    The ears 
are senseless that should give us hearing
    To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd
    That Ro
sencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.
    Where should we have our thanks?
  Hor. Not from his mout
h,
    Had it th' ability of life to thank you.
    He never gave commandment for their death.
  
  But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
    You from the Polack wars, and you from England,

    Are here arriv'd, give order that these bodies
    High on a stage be placed to the view;
  
  And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
    How these things came about. So shall you hear
 
   Of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts;
    Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters;
    Of de
aths put on by cunning and forc'd cause;
    And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
    Fall'n on t
h' inventors' heads. All this can I
    Truly deliver.
  Fort. Let us haste to hear it,
    And c
all the noblest to the audience.
    For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.
    I have some rig
hts of memory in this kingdom
    Which now, to claim my vantage doth invite me.
  Hor. Of that I 
shall have also cause to speak,
    And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more.
    But let 
this same be presently perform'd,
    Even while men's minds are wild, lest more mischance
    On 
plots and errors happen.
  Fort. Let four captains
    Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage;
 
   For he was likely, had he been put on,
    To have prov'd most royally; and for his passage
   
 The soldiers' music and the rites of war
    Speak loudly for him.
    Take up the bodies. Such a
 sight as this
    Becomes the field but here shows much amiss.
    Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
 
           Exeunt marching; after the which a peal of ordnance
                                    
               are shot off.

ACT I. Scene I
.
Elsinore. A platform before the Castle.

Enter two Sentinels-[first,] Francisco, [who paces up 
and down
at his post; then] Bernardo, [who approaches him].

  Ber. Who's there?
  Fran. Nay, an
swer me. Stand and unfold yourself.
  Ber. Long live the King!
  Fran. Bernardo?
  Ber. He.
  Fr
an. You come most carefully upon your hour.
  Ber. 'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francis
co.
  Fran. For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold,
    And I am sick at heart.
  Ber. Hav
e you had quiet guard?
  Fran. Not a mouse stirring.
  Ber. Well, good night.
    If you do meet 
Horatio and Marcellus,
    The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.

                    Ente
r Horatio and Marcellus.

  Fran. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?
  Hor. Friends to
 this ground.
  Mar. And liegemen to the Dane.
  Fran. Give you good night.
  Mar. O, farewell, h
onest soldier.
    Who hath reliev'd you?
  Fran. Bernardo hath my place.
    Give you good night
.                                   Exit.
  Mar. Holla, Bernardo!
  Ber. Say-
    What, is Horati
o there ?
  Hor. A piece of him.
  Ber. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.
  Mar. What, h
as this thing appear'd again to-night?
  Ber. I have seen nothing.
  Mar. Horatio says 'tis but ou
r fantasy,
    And will not let belief take hold of him
    Touching this dreaded sight, twice see
n of us.
    Therefore I have entreated him along,
    With us to watch the minutes of this night,

    That, if again this apparition come,
    He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
  Hor. Tus
h, tush, 'twill not appear.
  Ber. Sit down awhile,
    And let us once again assail your ears,
 
   That are so fortified against our story,
    What we two nights have seen.
  Hor. Well, sit we 
down,
    And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
  Ber. Last night of all,
    When yond same st
ar that's westward from the pole
    Had made his course t' illume that part of heaven
    Where n
ow it burns, Marcellus and myself,
    The bell then beating one-

                        Enter 
Ghost.

  Mar. Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!
  Ber. In the same figure, like 
the King that's dead.
  Mar. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
  Ber. Looks it not like th
e King? Mark it, Horatio.
  Hor. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.
  Ber. It would be
 spoke to.
  Mar. Question it, Horatio.
  Hor. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night
   
 Together with that fair and warlike form
    In which the majesty of buried Denmark
    Did somet
imes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!
  Mar. It is offended.
  Ber. See, it stalks away!
  H
or. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!
                                                     E
xit Ghost.
  Mar. 'Tis gone and will not answer.
  Ber. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pal
e.
    Is not this something more than fantasy?
    What think you on't?
  Hor. Before my God, I 
might not this believe
    Without the sensible and true avouch
    Of mine own eyes.
  Mar. Is i
t not like the King?
  Hor. As thou art to thyself.
    Such was the very armour he had on
    Wh
en he th' ambitious Norway combated.
    So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,
    He smote 
the sledded Polacks on the ice.
    'Tis strange.
  Mar. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead 
hour,
    With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
  Hor. In what particular thought to work 
I know not;
    But, in the gross and scope of my opinion,
    This bodes some strange eruption to
 our state.
  Mar. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows,
    Why this same strict and mos
t observant watch
    So nightly toils the subject of the land,
    And why such daily cast of bra
zen cannon
    And foreign mart for implements of war;
    Why such impress of shipwrights, whose 
sore task
    Does not divide the Sunday from the week.
    What might be toward, that this sweaty
 haste
    Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day?
    Who is't that can inform me?
  Ho
r. That can I.
    At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
    Whose image even but now appe
ar'd to us,
    Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
    Thereto prick'd on by a most emulat
e pride,
    Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet
    (For so this side of our known w
orld esteem'd him)
    Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,
    Well ratified by la
w and heraldry,
    Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
    Which he stood seiz'd of, 
to the conqueror;
    Against the which a moiety competent
    Was gaged by our king; which had re
turn'd
    To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
    Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant

    And carriage of the article design'd,
    His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
   
 Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
    Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,
    Shark'd 
up a list of lawless resolutes,
    For food and diet, to some enterprise
    That hath a stomach 
in't; which is no other,
    As it doth well appear unto our state,
    But to recover of us, by s
trong hand
    And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
    So by his father lost; and this, I
 take it,
    Is the main motive of our preparations,
    The source of this our watch, and the ch
ief head
    Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
  Ber. I think it be no other but e'en so.

    Well may it sort that this portentous figure
    Comes armed through our watch, so like the K
ing
    That was and is the question of these wars.
  Hor. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.

    In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
    A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
    Th
e graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead
    Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;
  
  As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood,
    Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
  
  Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
    Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.
    A
nd even the like precurse of fierce events,
    As harbingers preceding still the fates
    And pr
ologue to the omen coming on,
    Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
    Unto our climatu
re and countrymen.

                      Enter Ghost again.

    But soft! behold! Lo, where it
 comes again!
    I'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!
                             
                  Spreads his arms.
    If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
    Speak to me.

    If there be any good thing to be done,
    That may to thee do ease, and, race to me,
    Spe
ak to me.
    If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
    Which happily foreknowing may avoid,
 
   O, speak!
    Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
    Extorted treasure in the womb of earth

    (For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death),
                                        
         The cock crows.
    Speak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!
  Mar. Shall I str
ike at it with my partisan?
  Hor. Do, if it will not stand.
  Ber. 'Tis here!
  Hor. 'Tis here!

  Mar. 'Tis gone!
                                                     Exit Ghost.
    We do it w
rong, being so majestical,
    To offer it the show of violence;
    For it is as the air, invulne
rable,
    And our vain blows malicious mockery.
  Ber. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.

  Hor. And then it started, like a guilty thing
    Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
    The
 cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
    Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
    Awa
ke the god of day; and at his warning,
    Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
    Th' extrav
agant and erring spirit hies
    To his confine; and of the truth herein
    This present object m
ade probation.
  Mar. It faded on the crowing of the cock.
    Some say that ever, 'gainst that se
ason comes
    Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
    The bird of dawning singeth all nigh
t long;
    And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,
    The nights are wholesome, then no 
planets strike,
    No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
    So hallow'd and so gracious
 is the time.
  Hor. So have I heard and do in part believe it.
    But look, the morn, in russet 
mantle clad,
    Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.
    Break we our watch up; and by m
y advice
    Let us impart what we have seen to-night
    Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
 
   This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
    Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
 
   As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
    Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
    
Where we shall find him most conveniently.           Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A room of
 state in the Castle.

Flourish. [Enter Claudius, King of Denmark, Gertrude the Queen,
Hamlet,
P
olonius, Laertes and his sister Ophelia, [Voltemand, Cornelius,]
Lords Attendant.

  King. Though
 yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
    The memory be green, and that it us befitted
    To be
ar our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom
    To be contracted in one brow of woe,
    Yet so 
far hath discretion fought with nature
    That we with wisest sorrow think on him
    Together wi
th remembrance of ourselves.
    Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
    Th' imperial jo
intress to this warlike state,
    Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,
    With an auspicious,
 and a dropping eye,
    With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,
    In equal scale wei
ghing delight and dole,
    Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd
    Your better wisdoms, whic
h have freely gone
    With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
    Now follows, that you know
, young Fortinbras,
    Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
    Or thinking by our late dear bro
ther's death
    Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
    Colleagued with this dream of his 
advantage,
    He hath not fail'd to pester us with message
    Importing the surrender of those l
ands
    Lost by his father, with all bands of law,
    To our most valiant brother. So much for h
im.
    Now for ourself and for this time of meeting.
    Thus much the business is: we have here 
writ
    To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,
    Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears
    O
f this his nephew's purpose, to suppress
    His further gait herein, in that the levies,
    The 
lists, and full proportions are all made
    Out of his subject; and we here dispatch
    You, goo
d Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,
    For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,
    Giving to you
 no further personal power
    To business with the King, more than the scope
    Of these dilated
 articles allow.            [Gives a paper.]
    Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
 
 Cor., Volt. In that, and all things, will we show our duty.
  King. We doubt it nothing. Heartily 
farewell.
                                 Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius.
    And now, Laertes, w
hat's the news with you?
    You told us of some suit. What is't, Laertes?
    You cannot speak of
 reason to the Dane
    And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
    That shall not be
 my offer, not thy asking?
    The head is not more native to the heart,
    The hand more instrum
ental to the mouth,
    Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
    What wouldst thou have, L
aertes?
  Laer. My dread lord,
    Your leave and favour to return to France;
    From whence tho
ugh willingly I came to Denmark
    To show my duty in your coronation,
    Yet now I must confess
, that duty done,
    My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
    And bow them to your gra
cious leave and pardon.
  King. Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
  Pol. He hath, 
my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
    By laboursome petition, and at last
    Upon his will I s
eal'd my hard consent.
    I do beseech you give him leave to go.
  King. Take thy fair hour, Laer
tes. Time be thine,
    And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
    But now, my cousin Hamlet, a
nd my son-
  Ham. [aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind!
  King. How is it that the c
louds still hang on you?
  Ham. Not so, my lord. I am too much i' th' sun.
  Queen. Good Hamlet, c
ast thy nighted colour off,
    And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
    Do not for ev
er with thy vailed lids
    Seek for thy noble father in the dust.
    Thou know'st 'tis common. A
ll that lives must die,
    Passing through nature to eternity.
  Ham. Ay, madam, it is common.
 
 Queen. If it be,
    Why seems it so particular with thee?
  Ham. Seems, madam, Nay, it is. I kno
w not 'seems.'
    'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
    Nor customary suits of solemn bl
ack,
    Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,
    No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
    N
or the dejected havior of the visage,
    Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
    'Th
at can denote me truly. These indeed seem,
    For they are actions that a man might play;
    But
 I have that within which passeth show-
    These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
  King. 
'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
    To give these mourning duties to your father
;
    But you must know, your father lost a father;
    That father lost, lost his, and the surviv
or bound
    In filial obligation for some term
    To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever
    
In obstinate condolement is a course
    Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief;
    It shows
 a will most incorrect to heaven,
    A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
    An understanding 
simple and unschool'd;
    For what we know must be, and is as common
    As any the most vulgar t
hing to sense,
    Why should we in our peevish opposition
    Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault
 to heaven,
    A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
    To reason most absurd, whose comm
on theme
    Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
    From the first corse till he that 
died to-day,
    'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth
    This unprevailing woe, and thin
k of us
    As of a father; for let the world take note
    You are the most immediate to our thro
ne,
    And with no less nobility of love
    Than that which dearest father bears his son
    Do
 I impart toward you. For your intent
    In going back to school in Wittenberg,
    It is most re
trograde to our desire;
    And we beseech you, bend you to remain
    Here in the cheer and comfo
rt of our eye,
    Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
  Queen. Let not thy mother lose he
r prayers, Hamlet.
    I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.
  Ham. I shall in all my be
st obey you, madam.
  King. Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.
    Be as ourself in Denmark. Mad
am, come.
    This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet
    Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whe
reof,
    No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day
    But the great cannon to the clouds shall
 tell,
    And the King's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,
    Respeaking earthly thunder. Come
 away.
                                Flourish. Exeunt all but Hamlet.
  Ham. O that this too too
 solid flesh would melt,
    Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!
    Or that the Everlasting had 
not fix'd
    His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
    How weary, stale, flat, and unprof
itable
    Seem to me all the uses of this world!
    Fie on't! ah, fie! 'Tis an unweeded garden

    That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
    Possess it merely. That it should come 
to this!
    But two months dead! Nay, not so much, not two.
    So excellent a king, that was to 
this
    Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
    That he might not beteem the winds of hea
ven
    Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
    Must I remember? Why, she would hang on 
him
    As if increase of appetite had grown
    By what it fed on; and yet, within a month-
    
Let me not think on't! Frailty, thy name is woman!-
    A little month, or ere those shoes were old

    With which she followed my poor father's body
    Like Niobe, all tears- why she, even she
 
   (O God! a beast that wants discourse of reason
    Would have mourn'd longer) married with my un
cle;
    My father's brother, but no more like my father
    Than I to Hercules. Within a month,

    Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
    Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
    S
he married. O, most wicked speed, to post
    With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
    It is 
not, nor it cannot come to good.
    But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue!

          En
ter Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo.

  Hor. Hail to your lordship!
  Ham. I am glad to see you 
well.
    Horatio!- or I do forget myself.
  Hor. The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.

  Ham. Sir, my good friend- I'll change that name with you.
    And what make you from Wittenberg, 
Horatio?
    Marcellus?
  Mar. My good lord!
  Ham. I am very glad to see you.- [To Bernardo] Goo
d even, sir.-

    But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
  Hor. A truant disposition, goo
d my lord.
  Ham. I would not hear your enemy say so,
    Nor shall you do my ear that violence
 
   To make it truster of your own report
    Against yourself. I know you are no truant.
    But w
hat is your affair in Elsinore?
    We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
  Hor. My lord, 
I came to see your father's funeral.
  Ham. I prithee do not mock me, fellow student.
    I think 
it was to see my mother's wedding.
  Hor. Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.
  Ham. Thrift, t
hrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats
    Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
    Woul
d I had met my dearest foe in heaven
    Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
    My father- meth
inks I see my father.
  Hor. O, where, my lord?
  Ham. In my mind's eye, Horatio.
  Hor. I saw hi
m once. He was a goodly king.
  Ham. He was a man, take him for all in all.
    I shall not look u
pon his like again.
  Hor. My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
  Ham. Saw? who?
  Hor. My lor
d, the King your father.
  Ham. The King my father?
  Hor. Season your admiration for a while
   
 With an attent ear, till I may deliver
    Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
    This marvel t
o you.
  Ham. For God's love let me hear!
  Hor. Two nights together had these gentlemen
    (Mar
cellus and Bernardo) on their watch
    In the dead vast and middle of the night
    Been thus enc
ount'red. A figure like your father,
    Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
    Appears before them
 and with solemn march
    Goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walk'd
    By their oppress'd 
and fear-surprised eyes,
    Within his truncheon's length; whilst they distill'd
    Almost to je
lly with the act of fear,
    Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
    In dreadful secrecy 
impart they did,
    And I with them the third night kept the watch;
    Where, as they had delive
r'd, both in time,
    Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
    The apparition comes. 
I knew your father.
    These hands are not more like.
  Ham. But where was this?
  Mar. My lord,
 upon the platform where we watch'd.
  Ham. Did you not speak to it?
  Hor. My lord, I did;
    B
ut answer made it none. Yet once methought
    It lifted up it head and did address
    Itself to 
motion, like as it would speak;
    But even then the morning cock crew loud,
    And at the sound
 it shrunk in haste away
    And vanish'd from our sight.
  Ham. 'Tis very strange.
  Hor. As I d
o live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
    And we did think it writ down in our duty
    To let you 
know of it.
  Ham. Indeed, indeed, sirs. But this troubles me.
    Hold you the watch to-night?
 
 Both [Mar. and Ber.] We do, my lord.
  Ham. Arm'd, say you?
  Both. Arm'd, my lord.
  Ham. From 
top to toe?
  Both. My lord, from head to foot.
  Ham. Then saw you not his face?
  Hor. O, yes, 
my lord! He wore his beaver up.
  Ham. What, look'd he frowningly.
  Hor. A countenance more in so
rrow than in anger.
  Ham. Pale or red?
  Hor. Nay, very pale.
  Ham. And fix'd his eyes upon you
?
  Hor. Most constantly.
  Ham. I would I had been there.
  Hor. It would have much amaz'd you.

  Ham. Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
  Hor. While one with moderate haste might tell a hun
dred.
  Both. Longer, longer.
  Hor. Not when I saw't.
  Ham. His beard was grizzled- no?
  Hor.
 It was, as I have seen it in his life,
    A sable silver'd.
  Ham. I will watch to-night.
    P
erchance 'twill walk again.
  Hor. I warr'nt it will.
  Ham. If it assume my noble father's person
,
    I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
    And bid me hold my peace. I pray you al
l,
    If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
    Let it be tenable in your silence still;
  
  And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
    Give it an understanding but no tongue.
    I will r
equite your loves. So, fare you well.
    Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
    I'll vi
sit you.
  All. Our duty to your honour.
  Ham. Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell.
           
                             Exeunt [all but Hamlet].
    My father's spirit- in arms? All is not w
ell.
    I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come!
    Till then sit still, my soul. Foul
 deeds will rise,
    Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
Exit.




Scene III
.
Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius.

Enter Laertes and Ophelia.

  Laer. My necessarie
s are embark'd. Farewell.
    And, sister, as the winds give benefit
    And convoy is assistant, 
do not sleep,
    But let me hear from you.
  Oph. Do you doubt that?
  Laer. For Hamlet, and the
 trifling of his favour,
    Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood;
    A violet in the youth of p
rimy nature,
    Forward, not permanent- sweet, not lasting;
    The perfume and suppliance of a m
inute;
    No more.
  Oph. No more but so?
  Laer. Think it no more.
    For nature crescent doe
s not grow alone
    In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,
    The inward service of the mi
nd and soul
    Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
    And now no soil nor cautel doth b
esmirch
    The virtue of his will; but you must fear,
    His greatness weigh'd, his will is not 
his own;
    For he himself is subject to his birth.
    He may not, as unvalued persons do,
    
Carve for himself, for on his choice depends
    The safety and health of this whole state,
    An
d therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd
    Unto the voice and yielding of that body
    Wher
eof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
    It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
   
 As he in his particular act and place
    May give his saying deed; which is no further
    Than 
the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
    Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain
    If wit
h too credent ear you list his songs,
    Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
    To 
his unmast'red importunity.
    Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
    And keep you in the
 rear of your affection,
    Out of the shot and danger of desire.
    The chariest maid is prodig
al enough
    If she unmask her beauty to the moon.
    Virtue itself scopes not calumnious stroke
s.
    The canker galls the infants of the spring
    Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd,

    And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
    Contagious blastments are most imminent.
    Be wa
ry then; best safety lies in fear.
    Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
  Oph. I sha
ll th' effect of this good lesson keep
    As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
    Do n
ot as some ungracious pastors do,
    Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven,
    Whiles, like
 a puff'd and reckless libertine,
    Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads
    And recks 
not his own rede.
  Laer. O, fear me not!

                       Enter Polonius.

    I stay t
oo long. But here my father comes.
    A double blessing is a double grace;
    Occasion smiles up
on a second leave.
  Pol. Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame!
    The wind sits in the s
houlder of your sail,
    And you are stay'd for. There- my blessing with thee!
    And these few 
precepts in thy memory
    Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
    Nor any unproport
ion'd thought his act.
    Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar:
    Those friends thou hast, 
and their adoption tried,
    Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel;
    But do not dull 
thy palm with entertainment
    Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware
    Of entrance to 
a quarrel; but being in,
    Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee.
    Give every man thine 
ear, but few thy voice;
    Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
    Costly thy habi
t as thy purse can buy,
    But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
    For the apparel oft p
roclaims the man,
    And they in France of the best rank and station
    Are most select and gene
rous, chief in that.
    Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
    For loan oft loses both itself an
d friend,
    And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
    This above all- to thine own self be 
true,
    And it must follow, as the night the day,
    Thou canst not then be false to any man.

    Farewell. My blessing season this in thee!
  Laer. Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
  
Pol. The time invites you. Go, your servants tend.
  Laer. Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well
  
  What I have said to you.
  Oph. 'Tis in my memory lock'd,
    And you yourself shall keep the ke
y of it.
  Laer. Farewell.                                          Exit.
  Pol. What is't, Opheli
a, he hath said to you?
  Oph. So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
  Pol. Marry, we
ll bethought!
    'Tis told me he hath very oft of late
    Given private time to you, and you you
rself
    Have of your audience been most free and bounteous.
    If it be so- as so 'tis put on m
e,
    And that in way of caution- I must tell you
    You do not understand yourself so clearly

    As it behooves my daughter and your honour.
    What is between you? Give me up the truth.
  O
ph. He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
    Of his affection to me.
  Pol. Affection? Pooh
! You speak like a green girl,
    Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
    Do you believe his 
tenders, as you call them?
  Oph. I do not know, my lord, what I should think,
  Pol. Marry, I wil
l teach you! Think yourself a baby
    That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
    Which a
re not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,
    Or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
  
  Running it thus) you'll tender me a fool.
  Oph. My lord, he hath importun'd me with love
    In
 honourable fashion.
  Pol. Ay, fashion you may call it. Go to, go to!
  Oph. And hath given count
enance to his speech, my lord,
    With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
  Pol. Ay, springes to
 catch woodcocks! I do know,
    When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
    Lends the tongue 
vows. These blazes, daughter,
    Giving more light than heat, extinct in both
    Even in their p
romise, as it is a-making,
    You must not take for fire. From this time
    Be something scanter
 of your maiden presence.
    Set your entreatments at a higher rate
    Than a command to parley.
 For Lord Hamlet,
    Believe so much in him, that he is young,
    And with a larger tether may h
e walk
    Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia,
    Do not believe his vows; for they are broke
rs,
    Not of that dye which their investments show,
    But mere implorators of unholy suits,
 
   Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
    The better to beguile. This is for all:
    I wo
uld not, in plain terms, from this time forth
    Have you so slander any moment leisure
    As to
 give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
    Look to't, I charge you. Come your ways.
  Oph. I sh
all obey, my lord.
                                                         Exeunt.




Scene 
IV.
Elsinore. The platform before the Castle.

Enter Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus.

  Ham. Th
e air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
  Hor. It is a nipping and an eager air.
  Ham. What hour n
ow?
  Hor. I think it lacks of twelve.
  Mar. No, it is struck.
  Hor. Indeed? I heard it not. It
 then draws near the season
    Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
                   A flo
urish of trumpets, and two pieces go off.
    What does this mean, my lord?
  Ham. The King doth w
ake to-night and takes his rouse,
    Keeps wassail, and the swagg'ring upspring reels,
    And, a
s he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
    The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out
    The tri
umph of his pledge.
  Hor. Is it a custom?
  Ham. Ay, marry, is't;
    But to my mind, though I a
m native here
    And to the manner born, it is a custom
    More honour'd in the breach than the 
observance.
    This heavy-headed revel east and west
    Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nat
ions;
    They clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase
    Soil our addition; and indeed it take
s
    From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
    The pith and marrow of our attribute.

    So oft it chances in particular men
    That, for some vicious mole of nature in them,
    A
s in their birth,- wherein they are not guilty,
    Since nature cannot choose his origin,-
    By
 the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
    Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
    Or by
 some habit that too much o'erleavens
    The form of plausive manners, that these men
    Carryin
g, I say, the stamp of one defect,
    Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,
    Their virtues
 else- be they as pure as grace,
    As infinite as man may undergo-
    Shall in the general cens
ure take corruption
    From that particular fault. The dram of e'il
    Doth all the noble substa
nce often dout To his own scandal.

                         Enter Ghost.

  Hor. Look, my lord,
 it comes!
  Ham. Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
    Be thou a spirit of health or gobli
n damn'd,
    Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
    Be thy intents wicked or c
haritable,
    Thou com'st in such a questionable shape
    That I will speak to thee. I'll call t
hee Hamlet,
    King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me?
    Let me not burst in ignorance, but tel
l
    Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,
    Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre

    Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
    Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws
    To cast
 thee up again. What may this mean
    That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,
    Revisit
s thus the glimpses of the moon,
    Making night hideous, and we fools of nature
    So horridly 
to shake our disposition
    With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
    Say, why is this? 
wherefore? What should we do?
                                           Ghost beckons Hamlet.
  H
or. It beckons you to go away with it,
    As if it some impartment did desire
    To you alone.

  Mar. Look with what courteous action
    It waves you to a more removed ground.
    But do not g
o with it!
  Hor. No, by no means!
  Ham. It will not speak. Then will I follow it.
  Hor. Do not
, my lord!
  Ham. Why, what should be the fear?
    I do not set my life at a pin's fee;
    And 
for my soul, what can it do to that,
    Being a thing immortal as itself?
    It waves me forth a
gain. I'll follow it.
  Hor. What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
    Or to the dreadfu
l summit of the cliff
    That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
    And there assume some other
, horrible form
    Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
    And draw you into madness? 
Think of it.
    The very place puts toys of desperation,
    Without more motive, into every brai
n
    That looks so many fadoms to the sea
    And hears it roar beneath.
  Ham. It waves me stil
l.
    Go on. I'll follow thee.
  Mar. You shall not go, my lord.
  Ham. Hold off your hands!
  
Hor. Be rul'd. You shall not go.
  Ham. My fate cries out
    And makes each petty artire in this 
body
    As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
                                                [Gho
st beckons.]

    Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
    By heaven, I'll make a ghost of hi
m that lets me!-
    I say, away!- Go on. I'll follow thee.
                                      
  Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet.
  Hor. He waxes desperate with imagination.
  Mar. Let's follow. 'Tis n
ot fit thus to obey him.
  Hor. Have after. To what issue will this come?
  Mar. Something is rott
en in the state of Denmark.
  Hor. Heaven will direct it.
  Mar. Nay, let's follow him.
         
                                                Exeunt.




Scene V.
Elsinore. The Castle. Ano
ther part of the fortifications.

Enter Ghost and Hamlet.

  Ham. Whither wilt thou lead me? Spe
ak! I'll go no further.
  Ghost. Mark me.
  Ham. I will.
  Ghost. My hour is almost come,
    Wh
en I to sulph'rous and tormenting flames
    Must render up myself.
  Ham. Alas, poor ghost!
  Gh
ost. Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
    To what I shall unfold.
  Ham. Speak. I am boun
d to hear.
  Ghost. So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
  Ham. What?
  Ghost. I am thy 
father's spirit,
    Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
    And for the day confin'd to 
fast in fires,
    Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
    Are burnt and purg'd away. B
ut that I am forbid
    To tell the secrets of my prison house,
    I could a tale unfold whose li
ghtest word
    Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
    Make thy two eyes, like star
s, start from their spheres,
    Thy knotted and combined locks to part,
    And each particular h
air to stand on end
    Like quills upon the fretful porcupine.
    But this eternal blazon must n
ot be
    To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
    If thou didst ever thy dear father 
love-
  Ham. O God!
  Ghost. Revenge his foul and most unnatural murther.
  Ham. Murther?
  Ghos
t. Murther most foul, as in the best it is;
    But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.
  Ham.
 Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
    As meditation or the thoughts of love,
    Ma
y sweep to my revenge.
  Ghost. I find thee apt;
    And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed

    That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
    Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear
.
    'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
    A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Den
mark
    Is by a forged process of my death
    Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth,
    Th
e serpent that did sting thy father's life
    Now wears his crown.
  Ham. O my prophetic soul!
 
   My uncle?
  Ghost. Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
    With witchcraft of his wit, 
with traitorous gifts-
    O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
    So to seduce!- won to h
is shameful lust
    The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.
    O Hamlet, what a falling-off 
was there,
    From me, whose love was of that dignity
    That it went hand in hand even with the
 vow
    I made to her in marriage, and to decline
    Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor

    To those of mine!
    But virtue, as it never will be mov'd,
    Though lewdness court it in
 a shape of heaven,
    So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
    Will sate itself in a celes
tial bed
    And prey on garbage.
    But soft! methinks I scent the morning air.
    Brief let m
e be. Sleeping within my orchard,
    My custom always of the afternoon,
    Upon my secure hour t
hy uncle stole,
    With juice of cursed hebona in a vial,
    And in the porches of my ears did p
our
    The leperous distilment; whose effect
    Holds such an enmity with blood of man
    That
 swift as quicksilver it courses through
    The natural gates and alleys of the body,
    And wit
h a sudden vigour it doth posset
    And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
    The thin and wh
olesome blood. So did it mine;
    And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
    Most lazar-like, wi
th vile and loathsome crust
    All my smooth body.
    Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand

    Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd;
    Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,

    Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd,
    No reckoning made, but sent to my account
    With all
 my imperfections on my head.
  Ham. O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
  Ghost. If thou has
t nature in thee, bear it not.
    Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
    A couch for luxury and 
damned incest.
    But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
    Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul
 contrive
    Against thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven,
    And to those thorns that in her b
osom lodge
    To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once.
    The glowworm shows the matin to
 be near
    And gins to pale his uneffectual fire.
    Adieu, adieu, adieu! Remember me.         
             Exit.

  Ham. O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?
    And shall I couple h
ell? Hold, hold, my heart!
    And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
    But bear me stiffly u
p. Remember thee?
    Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
    In this distracted globe.
 Remember thee?
    Yea, from the table of my memory
    I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,

    All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past
    That youth and observation copied there,

    And thy commandment all alone shall live
    Within the book and volume of my brain,
    Unmi
x'd with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!
    O most pernicious woman!
    O villain, villain, smilin
g, damned villain!
    My tables! Meet it is I set it down
    That one may smile, and smile, and 
be a villain;
    At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark.        [Writes.]
    So, uncle, ther
e you are. Now to my word:
    It is 'Adieu, adieu! Remember me.'
    I have sworn't.
  Hor. (wit
hin) My lord, my lord!

                   Enter Horatio and Marcellus.

  Mar. Lord Hamlet!
  
Hor. Heaven secure him!
  Ham. So be it!
  Mar. Illo, ho, ho, my lord!
  Ham. Hillo, ho, ho, boy!
 Come, bird, come.
  Mar. How is't, my noble lord?
  Hor. What news, my lord?
  Mar. O, wonderful
!
  Hor. Good my lord, tell it.
  Ham. No, you will reveal it.
  Hor. Not I, my lord, by heaven!

  Mar. Nor I, my lord.
  Ham. How say you then? Would heart of man once think it?
    But you'll 
be secret?
  Both. Ay, by heaven, my lord.
  Ham. There's neer a villain dwelling in all Denmark

    But he's an arrant knave.
  Hor. There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
    To tel
l us this.
  Ham. Why, right! You are in the right!
    And so, without more circumstance at all,

    I hold it fit that we shake hands and part;
    You, as your business and desires shall point 
you,
    For every man hath business and desire,
    Such as it is; and for my own poor part,
   
 Look you, I'll go pray.
  Hor. These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
  Ham. I am sorry 
they offend you, heartily;
    Yes, faith, heartily.
  Hor. There's no offence, my lord.
  Ham. Y
es, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
    And much offence too. Touching this vision here,

    It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.
    For your desire to know what is between us,
 
   O'ermaster't as you may. And now, good friends,
    As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,

    Give me one poor request.
  Hor. What is't, my lord? We will.
  Ham. Never make known what yo
u have seen to-night.
  Both. My lord, we will not.
  Ham. Nay, but swear't.
  Hor. In faith,
  
  My lord, not I.
  Mar. Nor I, my lord- in faith.
  Ham. Upon my sword.
  Mar. We have sworn, my
 lord, already.
  Ham. Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.

                 Ghost cries under the sta
ge.

  Ghost. Swear.
  Ham. Aha boy, say'st thou so? Art thou there, truepenny?
    Come on! You
 hear this fellow in the cellarage.
    Consent to swear.
  Hor. Propose the oath, my lord.
  Ham
. Never to speak of this that you have seen.
    Swear by my sword.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
  H
am. Hic et ubique? Then we'll shift our ground.
    Come hither, gentlemen,
    And lay your hands
 again upon my sword.
    Never to speak of this that you have heard:
    Swear by my sword.
  Gh
ost. [beneath] Swear by his sword.
  Ham. Well said, old mole! Canst work i' th' earth so fast?
  
  A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends."
  Hor. O day and night, but this is wondrous st
range!
  Ham. And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
    There are more things in heaven and
 earth, Horatio,
    Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
    But come!
    Here, as before, ne
ver, so help you mercy,
    How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself
    (As I perchance hereafter 
shall think meet
    To put an antic disposition on),
    That you, at such times seeing me, never
 shall,
    With arms encumb'red thus, or this head-shake,
    Or by pronouncing of some doubtful 
phrase,
    As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'
    Or 'If we list to speak,'
 or 'There be, an if they might,'
    Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
    That you know augh
t of me- this is not to do,
    So grace and mercy at your most need help you,
    Swear.
  Ghost
. [beneath] Swear.
                                                   [They swear.]
  Ham. Rest, r
est, perturbed spirit! So, gentlemen,
    With all my love I do commend me to you;
    And what so
 poor a man as Hamlet is
    May do t' express his love and friending to you,
    God willing, sha
ll not lack. Let us go in together;
    And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
    The time 
is out of joint. O cursed spite
    That ever I was born to set it right!
    Nay, come, let's go 
together.
                                                         Exeunt.

Act
 II. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius.

Enter Polonius and Reynaldo.

  Pol. 
Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
  Rey. I will, my lord.
  Pol. You shall do marvell
's wisely, good Reynaldo,
    Before You visit him, to make inquire
    Of his behaviour.
  Rey. 
My lord, I did intend it.
  Pol. Marry, well said, very well said. Look you, sir,
    Enquire me f
irst what Danskers are in Paris;
    And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
    What c
ompany, at what expense; and finding
    By this encompassment and drift of question
    That they
 do know my son, come you more nearer
    Than your particular demands will touch it.
    Take you
, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
    As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
    A
nd in part him.' Do you mark this, Reynaldo?
  Rey. Ay, very well, my lord.
  Pol. 'And in part hi
m, but,' you may say, 'not well.
    But if't be he I mean, he's very wild
    Addicted so and so'
; and there put on him
    What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
    As may dishonour him
- take heed of that;
    But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips
    As are companions noted 
and most known
    To youth and liberty.
  Rey. As gaming, my lord.
  Pol. Ay, or drinking, fenci
ng, swearing, quarrelling,
    Drabbing. You may go so far.
  Rey. My lord, that would dishonour h
im.
  Pol. Faith, no, as you may season it in the charge.
    You must not put another scandal on 
him,
    That he is open to incontinency.
    That's not my meaning. But breathe his faults so qua
intly
    That they may seem the taints of liberty,
    The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
 
   A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
    Of general assault.
  Rey. But, my good lord-
  Pol. Wh
erefore should you do this?
  Rey. Ay, my lord,
    I would know that.
  Pol. Marry, sir, here's 
my drift,
    And I believe it is a fetch of warrant.
    You laying these slight sullies on my so
n
    As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' th' working,
    Mark you,
    Your party in converse,
 him you would sound,
    Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
    The youth you breathe of 
guilty, be assur'd
    He closes with you in this consequence:
    'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,'
 or 'gentleman'-
    According to the phrase or the addition
    Of man and country-
  Rey. Very 
good, my lord.
  Pol. And then, sir, does 'a this- 'a does- What was I about to
say?
    By the m
ass, I was about to say something! Where did I leave?
  Rey. At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'fr
iend or so,' and
    gentleman.'
  Pol. At 'closes in the consequence'- Ay, marry!
    He closes 
thus: 'I know the gentleman.
    I saw him yesterday, or t'other day,
    Or then, or then, with s
uch or such; and, as you say,
    There was 'a gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
    There fallin
g out at tennis'; or perchance,
    'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'
    Videlicet, a broth
el, or so forth.
    See you now-
    Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth;
    And th
us do we of wisdom and of reach,
    With windlasses and with assays of bias,
    By indirections 
find directions out.
    So, by my former lecture and advice,
    Shall you my son. You have me, h
ave you not?
  Rey. My lord, I have.
  Pol. God b' wi' ye, fare ye well!
  Rey. Good my lord!    
                                [Going.]
  Pol. Observe his inclination in yourself.
  Rey. I shal
l, my lord.
  Pol. And let him ply his music.
  Rey. Well, my lord.
  Pol. Farewell!
           
                                       Exit Reynaldo.

                       Enter Ophelia.

  
  How now, Ophelia? What's the matter?
  Oph. O my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
  Pol
. With what, i' th' name of God?
  Oph. My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
    Lord Hamlet, wi
th his doublet all unbrac'd,
    No hat upon his head, his stockings foul'd,
    Ungart'red, and d
own-gyved to his ankle;
    Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,
    And with a look 
so piteous in purport
    As if he had been loosed out of hell
    To speak of horrors- he comes b
efore me.
  Pol. Mad for thy love?
  Oph. My lord, I do not know,
    But truly I do fear it.
  
Pol. What said he?
  Oph. He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
    Then goes he to the length
 of all his arm,
    And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
    He falls to such perusal of 
my face
    As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so.
    At last, a little shaking of mine arm,
  
  And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
    He rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound
    As
 it did seem to shatter all his bulk
    And end his being. That done, he lets me go,
    And with
 his head over his shoulder turn'd
    He seem'd to find his way without his eyes,
    For out o' 
doors he went without their help
    And to the last bended their light on me.
  Pol. Come, go wit
h me. I will go seek the King.
    This is the very ecstasy of love,
    Whose violent property fo
rdoes itself
    And leads the will to desperate undertakings
    As oft as any passion under heav
en
    That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
    What, have you given him any hard words of l
ate?
  Oph. No, my good lord; but, as you did command,
    I did repel his letters and denied
   
 His access to me.
  Pol. That hath made him mad.
    I am sorry that with better heed and judgmen
t
    I had not quoted him. I fear'd he did but trifle
    And meant to wrack thee; but beshrew my
 jealousy!
    By heaven, it is as proper to our age
    To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions

    As it is common for the younger sort
    To lack discretion. Come, go we to the King.
    Thi
s must be known; which, being kept close, might move
    More grief to hide than hate to utter love
.
    Come.
                                                         Exeunt.

Scene II.
Elsinor
e. A room in the Castle.

Flourish. [Enter King and Queen, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern,
cum alii
s.

  King. Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
    Moreover that we much did long to see
 you,
    The need we have to use you did provoke
    Our hasty sending. Something have you heard

    Of Hamlet's transformation. So I call it,
    Sith nor th' exterior nor the inward man
    Re
sembles that it was. What it should be,
    More than his father's death, that thus hath put him
 
   So much from th' understanding of himself,
    I cannot dream of. I entreat you both
    That, 
being of so young days brought up with him,
    And since so neighbour'd to his youth and haviour,

    That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
    Some little time; so by your companies
   
 To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather
    So much as from occasion you may glean,
    Whethe
r aught to us unknown afflicts him thus
    That, open'd, lies within our remedy.
  Queen. Good ge
ntlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,
    And sure I am two men there are not living
    To whom he
 more adheres. If it will please you
    To show us so much gentry and good will
    As to expend 
your time with us awhile
    For the supply and profit of our hope,
    Your visitation shall rece
ive such thanks
    As fits a king's remembrance.
  Ros. Both your Majesties
    Might, by the so
vereign power you have of us,
    Put your dread pleasures more into command
    Than to entreaty.

  Guil. But we both obey,
    And here give up ourselves, in the full bent,
    To lay our servi
ce freely at your feet,
    To be commanded.
  King. Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.

  Queen. Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz.
    And I beseech you instantly to visit
  
  My too much changed son.- Go, some of you,
    And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
  Guil
. Heavens make our presence and our practices
    Pleasant and helpful to him!
  Queen. Ay, amen!

                 Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, [with some
                                 
                   Attendants].

                         Enter Polonius.

  Pol. Th' ambassador
s from Norway, my good lord,
    Are joyfully return'd.
  King. Thou still hast been the father of
 good news.
  Pol. Have I, my lord? Assure you, my good liege,
    I hold my duty as I hold my sou
l,
    Both to my God and to my gracious king;
    And I do think- or else this brain of mine
   
 Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
    As it hath us'd to do- that I have found
    The very c
ause of Hamlet's lunacy.
  King. O, speak of that! That do I long to hear.
  Pol. Give first admit
tance to th' ambassadors.
    My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
  King. Thyself do g
race to them, and bring them in.
                                                [Exit Polonius.]

    He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found
    The head and source of all your son's distempe
r.
  Queen. I doubt it is no other but the main,
    His father's death and our o'erhasty marriage
.
  King. Well, we shall sift him.

              Enter Polonius, Voltemand, and Cornelius.

  
  Welcome, my good friends.
    Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?
  Volt. Most fair re
turn of greetings and desires.
    Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
    His nephew's levies
; which to him appear'd
    To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack,
    But better look'd into, he
 truly found
    It was against your Highness; whereat griev'd,
    That so his sickness, age, and
 impotence
    Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
    On Fortinbras; which he, in brief,
 obeys,
    Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,
    Makes vow before his uncle never more

    To give th' assay of arms against your Majesty.
    Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
   
 Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee
    And his commission to employ those soldiers,
  
  So levied as before, against the Polack;
    With an entreaty, herein further shown,
           
                                     [Gives a paper.]
    That it might please you to give quiet pa
ss
    Through your dominions for this enterprise,
    On such regards of safety and allowance
  
  As therein are set down.
  King. It likes us well;
    And at our more consider'd time we'll rea
d,
    Answer, and think upon this business.
    Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour.

    Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together.
    Most welcome home!                       E
xeunt Ambassadors.
  Pol. This business is well ended.
    My liege, and madam, to expostulate
  
  What majesty should be, what duty is,
    Why day is day, night is night, and time is time.
    
Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time.
    Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
 
   And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
    I will be brief. Your noble son is mad.
 
   Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,
    What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
    B
ut let that go.
  Queen. More matter, with less art.
  Pol. Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
 
   That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
    And pity 'tis 'tis true. A foolish figure!

    But farewell it, for I will use no art.
    Mad let us grant him then. And now remains
    Tha
t we find out the cause of this effect-
    Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
    For this 
effect defective comes by cause.
    Thus it remains, and the remainder thus.
    Perpend.
    I 
have a daughter (have while she is mine),
    Who in her duty and obedience, mark,
    Hath given 
me this. Now gather, and surmise.
                                             [Reads] the letter.

    'To the celestial, and my soul's idol, the most beautified
      Ophelia,'-

    That's an i
ll phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is a vile
      phrase.
    But you shall hear. Thus:
    
                                                    [Reads.]
    'In her excellent white bosom, the
se, &c.'
  Queen. Came this from Hamlet to her?
  Pol. Good madam, stay awhile. I will be faithful
.     [Reads.]


          'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
            Doubt that the sun doth m
ove;
          Doubt truth to be a liar;
            But never doubt I love.
      'O dear Opheli
a, I am ill at these numbers; I have not art
to
    reckon my groans; but that I love thee best, O
 most best,
believe
    it. Adieu.
      'Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is 
to
him,

HAMLET.'

    This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me;
    And more above, hath
 his solicitings,
    As they fell out by time, by means, and place,
    All given to mine ear.
 
 King. But how hath she
    Receiv'd his love?
  Pol. What do you think of me?
  King. As of a ma
n faithful and honourable.
  Pol. I would fain prove so. But what might you think,
    When I had 
seen this hot love on the wing
    (As I perceiv'd it, I must tell you that,
    Before my daughte
r told me), what might you,
    Or my dear Majesty your queen here, think,
    If I had play'd the
 desk or table book,
    Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
    Or look'd upon this love 
with idle sight?
    What might you think? No, I went round to work
    And my young mistress thus
 I did bespeak:
    'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star.
    This must not be.' And then I p
rescripts gave her,
    That she should lock herself from his resort,
    Admit no messengers, rec
eive no tokens.
    Which done, she took the fruits of my advice,
    And he, repulsed, a short ta
le to make,
    Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
    Thence to a watch, thence into a weakne
ss,
    Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
    Into the madness wherein now he raves,

    And all we mourn for.
  King. Do you think 'tis this?
  Queen. it may be, very like.
  Pol.
 Hath there been such a time- I would fain know that-
    That I have Positively said ''Tis so,'
 
   When it prov'd otherwise.?
  King. Not that I know.
  Pol. [points to his head and shoulder] Ta
ke this from this, if
this
      be otherwise.
    If circumstances lead me, I will find
    Whe
re truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
    Within the centre.
  King. How may we try it furthe
r?
  Pol. You know sometimes he walks for hours together
    Here in the lobby.
  Queen. So he do
es indeed.
  Pol. At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him.
    Be you and I behind an arras t
hen.
    Mark the encounter. If he love her not,
    And he not from his reason fall'n thereon
  
  Let me be no assistant for a state,
    But keep a farm and carters.
  King. We will try it.


                 Enter Hamlet, reading on a book.

  Queen. But look where sadly the poor wretch c
omes reading.
  Pol. Away, I do beseech you, both away
    I'll board him presently. O, give me le
ave.
                       Exeunt King and Queen, [with Attendants].
    How does my good Lord Ha
mlet?
  Ham. Well, God-a-mercy.
  Pol. Do you know me, my lord?
  Ham. Excellent well. You are a 
fishmonger.
  Pol. Not I, my lord.
  Ham. Then I would you were so honest a man.
  Pol. Honest, m
y lord?
  Ham. Ay, sir. To be honest, as this world goes, is to be one
man
    pick'd out of ten 
thousand.
  Pol. That's very true, my lord.
  Ham. For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, bei
ng a god
    kissing carrion- Have you a daughter?
  Pol. I have, my lord.
  Ham. Let her not wal
k i' th' sun. Conception is a blessing, but
not
    as your daughter may conceive. Friend, look to
't.
  Pol. [aside] How say you by that? Still harping on my daughter.
Yet
    he knew me not at f
irst. He said I was a fishmonger. He is
far
    gone, far gone! And truly in my youth I suff'red m
uch
extremity
    for love- very near this. I'll speak to him again.- What do
you
    read, my l
ord?
  Ham. Words, words, words.
  Pol. What is the matter, my lord?
  Ham. Between who?
  Pol. 
I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
  Ham. Slanders, sir; for the satirical rogue says here 
that old
men
    have grey beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes
    purging thick am
ber and plum-tree gum; and that they have a
    plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams
. All
which,
    sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I
hold it
    not hones
ty to have it thus set down; for you yourself, sir,
    should be old as I am if, like a crab, you 
could go backward.

  Pol. [aside] Though this be madness, yet there is a method
in't.-
   Will 
You walk out of the air, my lord?
  Ham. Into my grave?
  Pol. Indeed, that is out o' th' air. [As
ide] How pregnant
sometimes
    his replies are! a happiness that often madness hits on,
which
 
   reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of.
I
    will leave him and suddenly 
contrive the means of meeting
between
    him and my daughter.- My honourable lord, I will most hu
mbly
take
    my leave of you.
  Ham. You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more
  
  willingly part withal- except my life, except my life, except
my
    life,

                  
  Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Pol. Fare you well, my lord.
  Ham. These tedious old fo
ols!
  Pol. You go to seek the Lord Hamlet. There he is.
  Ros. [to Polonius] God save you, sir!

                                                Exit [Polonius].

  Guil. My honour'd lord!
  Ros
. My most dear lord!
  Ham. My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern?
Ah,
    Rosen
crantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
  Ros. As the indifferent children of the earth.
  Guil. Happy 
in that we are not over-happy.
    On Fortune's cap we are not the very button.
  Ham. Nor the sol
es of her shoe?
  Ros. Neither, my lord.
  Ham. Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of
 her
    favours?
  Guil. Faith, her privates we.
  Ham. In the secret parts of Fortune? O! most 
true! she is a
    strumpet. What news ?
  Ros. None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.

  Ham. Then is doomsday near! But your news is not true. Let me
    question more in particular. W
hat have you, my good friends,
    deserved at the hands of Fortune that she sends you to prison
 
   hither?
  Guil. Prison, my lord?
  Ham. Denmark's a prison.
  Ros. Then is the world one.
  H
am. A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and
    dungeons, Denmark being one o' t
h' worst.
  Ros. We think not so, my lord.
  Ham. Why, then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing
 either
good
    or bad but thinking makes it so. To me it is a prison.
  Ros. Why, then your amb
ition makes it one. 'Tis too narrow for
your
    mind.
  Ham. O God, I could be bounded in a nuts
hell and count myself a
    king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.
  Guil. Wh
ich dreams indeed are ambition; for the very substance
of
    the ambitious is merely the shadow o
f a dream.
  Ham. A dream itself is but a shadow.
  Ros. Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and
 light a quality
that
    it is but a shadow's shadow.
  Ham. Then are our beggars bodies, and ou
r monarchs and
outstretch'd
    heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we to th' court? for, by
my
 
   fay, I cannot reason.
  Both. We'll wait upon you.
  Ham. No such matter! I will not sort you w
ith the rest of my
    servants; for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most
    dreadfully
 attended. But in the beaten way of friendship,
what
    make you at Elsinore?
  Ros. To visit yo
u, my lord; no other occasion.
  Ham. Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank
you;

    and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny.
Were
    you not sent for? Is it
 your own inclining? Is it a free
    visitation? Come, deal justly with me. Come, come! Nay,
spea
k.
  Guil. What should we say, my lord?
  Ham. Why, anything- but to th' purpose. You were sent fo
r; and
    there is a kind of confession in your looks, which your
modesties
    have not craft e
nough to colour. I know the good King and
Queen
    have sent for you.
  Ros. To what end, my lor
d?
  Ham. That you must teach me. But let me conjure you by the
rights
    of our fellowship, by 
the consonancy of our youth, by the
    obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dea
r
a
    better proposer could charge you withal, be even and direct
with
    me, whether you wer
e sent for or no.
  Ros. [aside to Guildenstern] What say you?
  Ham. [aside] Nay then, I have an 
eye of you.- If you love me,
hold
    not off.
  Guil. My lord, we were sent for.
  Ham. I will 
tell you why. So shall my anticipation prevent your
    discovery, and your secrecy to the King and
 Queen moult no
    feather. I have of late- but wherefore I know not- lost all
my
    mirth, for
gone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes
so
    heavily with my disposition that this goo
dly frame, the
earth,
    seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy,
the
    
air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this
majestical
    roof fretted with golden fire
- why, it appeareth no other
thing
    to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. Wh
at
a
    piece of work is a man! how noble in reason! how infinite in
    faculties! in form and 
moving how express and admirable! in
    action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! 
the
    beauty of the world, the paragon of animals! And yet to me
what
    is this quintessence 
of dust? Man delights not me- no, nor
woman
    neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so
.
  Ros. My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.
  Ham. Why did you laugh then, when I sa
id 'Man delights not me'?
  Ros. To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten
    ent
ertainment the players shall receive from you. We coted
them
    on the way, and hither are they c
oming to offer you service.
  Ham. He that plays the king shall be welcome- his Majesty shall
    
have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil
and
    target; the lover shall not 
sigh gratis; the humorous man
shall
    end his part in peace; the clown shall make those laugh wh
ose
    lungs are tickle o' th' sere; and the lady shall say her mind
    freely, or the blank ver
se shall halt for't. What players are
    they?
  Ros. Even those you were wont to take such delig
ht in, the
    tragedians of the city.
  Ham. How chances it they travel? Their residence, both in

    reputation and profit, was better both ways.
  Ros. I think their inhibition comes by the mea
ns of the late
    innovation.
  Ham. Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in
the

    city? Are they so follow'd?
  Ros. No indeed are they not.
  Ham. How comes it? Do they grow
 rusty?
  Ros. Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there
is,
    sir, an eyrie of 
children, little eyases, that cry out on the
top
    of question and are most tyrannically clapp'd
 for't. These
are now
    the fashion, and so berattle the common stages (so they call
    them) 
that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goosequills and
    dare scarce come thither.
  Ham. What,
 are they children? Who maintains 'em? How are they
    escoted? Will they pursue the quality no lo
nger than they can
    sing? Will they not say afterwards, if they should grow
    themselves to c
ommon players (as it is most like, if their
means
    are no better), their writers do them wrong 
to make them
exclaim
    against their own succession.
  Ros. Faith, there has been much to do on
 both sides; and the
nation
    holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy. There was, for
a
 
   while, no money bid for argument unless the poet and the
player
    went to cuffs in the questi
on.
  Ham. Is't possible?
  Guil. O, there has been much throwing about of brains.
  Ham. Do the 
boys carry it away?
  Ros. Ay, that they do, my lord- Hercules and his load too.
  Ham. It is not 
very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark,
and
    those that would make mows at him while my 
father lived give
    twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his picture
in
    little
. 'Sblood, there is something in this more than
natural, if
    philosophy could find it out.

 
                    Flourish for the Players.

  Guil. There are the players.
  Ham. Gentlemen, y
ou are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come!
Th'
    appurtenance of welcome is fashion and cerem
ony. Let me
comply
    with you in this garb, lest my extent to the players (which I
    tell you
 must show fairly outwards) should more appear like
    entertainment than yours. You are welcome. 
But my
uncle-father
    and aunt-mother are deceiv'd.
  Guil. In what, my dear lord?
  Ham. I am
 but mad north-north-west. When the wind is southerly
I
    know a hawk from a handsaw.

       
                     Enter Polonius.

  Pol. Well be with you, gentlemen!
  Ham. Hark you, Guilde
nstern- and you too- at each ear a hearer!
    That great baby you see there is not yet out of his 
swaddling
    clouts.
  Ros. Happily he's the second time come to them; for they say an
old
    
man is twice a child.
  Ham. I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players. Mark
it.-
   You
 say right, sir; a Monday morning; twas so indeed.
  Pol. My lord, I have news to tell you.
  Ham.
 My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an
actor in
    Rome-
  Pol. The actors are c
ome hither, my lord.
  Ham. Buzz, buzz!
  Pol. Upon my honour-
  Ham. Then came each actor on his
 ass-
  Pol. The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy,
    history, pastoral, past
oral-comical, historical-pastoral,
    tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral;

scene
    individable, or poem unlimited. Seneca cannot be too heavy,
nor
    Plautus too light. 
For the law of writ and the liberty, these
are
    the only men.
  Ham. O Jephthah, judge of Isra
el, what a treasure hadst thou!
  Pol. What treasure had he, my lord?
  Ham. Why,

         'One
 fair daughter, and no more,
           The which he loved passing well.'

  Pol. [aside] Still o
n my daughter.
  Ham. Am I not i' th' right, old Jephthah?
  Pol. If you call me Jephthah, my lord
, I have a daughter that I
    love passing well.
  Ham. Nay, that follows not.
  Pol. What follo
ws then, my lord?
  Ham. Why,

           'As by lot, God wot,'

 and then, you know,

      
     'It came to pass, as most like it was.'

    The first row of the pious chanson will show you
 more; for
look
    where my abridgment comes.

                     Enter four or five Players.


    You are welcome, masters; welcome, all.- I am glad to see
thee
    well.- Welcome, good fr
iends.- O, my old friend? Why, thy
face is
    valanc'd since I saw thee last. Com'st' thou to' be
ard me in
    Denmark?- What, my young lady and mistress? By'r Lady, your
    ladyship is nearer t
o heaven than when I saw you last by the
    altitude of a chopine. Pray God your voice, like a pie
ce of
    uncurrent gold, be not crack'd within the ring.- Masters, you
are
    all welcome. We'l
l e'en to't like French falconers, fly at
    anything we see. We'll have a speech straight. Come, 
give us
a
    taste of your quality. Come, a passionate speech.
  1. Play. What speech, my good l
ord?
  Ham. I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never
acted;
    or if it was, not ab
ove once; for the play, I remember,
pleas'd
    not the million, 'twas caviary to the general; but
 it was (as
I
    receiv'd it, and others, whose judgments in such matters
cried in
    the top 
of mine) an excellent play, well digested in the
scenes,
    set down with as much modesty as cunn
ing. I remember one said
    there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter
savoury,
    n
or no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of
    affectation; but call'd it an honest
 method, as wholesome as
    sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech
in't
   
 I chiefly lov'd. 'Twas AEneas' tale to Dido, and thereabout
of it
    especially where he speaks 
of Priam's slaughter. If it live
in
    your memory, begin at this line- let me see, let me see:


         'The rugged Pyrrhus, like th' Hyrcanian beast-'

    'Tis not so; it begins with Pyrrhu
s:

         'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
         Black as his purpose, did the nig
ht resemble
         When he lay couched in the ominous horse,
         Hath now this dread and bl
ack complexion smear'd
         With heraldry more dismal. Head to foot
         Now is be total g
ules, horridly trick'd
         With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
         Bak'd an
d impasted with the parching streets,
         That lend a tyrannous and a damned light
         T
o their lord's murther. Roasted in wrath and fire,
         And thus o'ersized with coagulate gore,

         With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
         Old grandsire Priam seeks.'

 
   So, proceed you.
  Pol. Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good
     discreti
on.

  1. Play. 'Anon he finds him,
      Striking too short at Greeks. His antique sword,
     
 Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
      Repugnant to command. Unequal match'd,
      Py
rrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide;
      But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
 
     Th' unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
      Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming
 top
      Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
      Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear. For lo!
 his sword,
      Which was declining on the milky head
      Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' th' air
 to stick.
      So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
      And, like a neutral to his will and
 matter,
      Did nothing.
      But, as we often see, against some storm,
      A silence in th
e heavens, the rack stand still,
      The bold winds speechless, and the orb below
      As hush 
as death- anon the dreadful thunder
      Doth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
      Ar
oused vengeance sets him new awork;
      And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
      On Mars's 
armour, forg'd for proof eterne,
      With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
      Now fa
lls on Priam.
      Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods,
      In general synod take awa
y her power;
      Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
      And bowl the round nave 
down the hill of heaven,
      As low as to the fiends!

  Pol. This is too long.
  Ham. It shal
l to the barber's, with your beard.- Prithee say
on.
    He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he
 sleeps. Say on;
come to
    Hecuba.

  1. Play. 'But who, O who, had seen the mobled queen-'


  Ham. 'The mobled queen'?
  Pol. That's good! 'Mobled queen' is good.

  1. Play. 'Run barefoot
 up and down, threat'ning the flames
      With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head
      Where l
ate the diadem stood, and for a robe,
      About her lank and all o'erteemed loins,
      A blank
et, in the alarm of fear caught up-
      Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd
      'G
ainst Fortune's state would treason have pronounc'd.
      But if the gods themselves did see her t
hen,
      When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
      In Mincing with his sword her husband's
 limbs,
      The instant burst of clamour that she made
      (Unless things mortal move them not
 at all)
      Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven
      And passion in the gods.'


  Pol. Look, whe'r he has not turn'd his colour, and has tears
in's
    eyes. Prithee no more!
 
 Ham. 'Tis well. I'll have thee speak out the rest of this
soon.-
    Good my lord, will you see t
he players well bestow'd? Do you
    hear? Let them be well us'd; for they are the abstract and
br
ief
    chronicles of the time. After your death you were better have
a
    bad epitaph than thei
r ill report while you live.
  Pol. My lord, I will use them according to their desert.
  Ham. God
's bodykins, man, much better! Use every man after his
    desert, and who should scape whipping? U
se them after your
own
    honour and dignity. The less they deserve, the more merit is
in
    y
our bounty. Take them in.
  Pol. Come, sirs.
  Ham. Follow him, friends. We'll hear a play to-morr
ow.
                 Exeunt Polonius and Players [except the First].
    Dost thou hear me, old fr
iend? Can you play 'The Murther of
    Gonzago'?
  1. Play. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. We'll ha't to-mor
row night. You could, for a need, study a
    speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which I would s
et down
and
    insert in't, could you not?
  1. Play. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Very well. Follow tha
t lord- and look you mock him not.
                                            [Exit First Player.]

    My good friends, I'll leave you till night. You are welcome
to
    Elsinore.
  Ros. Good my
 lord!
  Ham. Ay, so, God b' wi' ye!
                            [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenst
ern
    Now I am alone.
    O what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
    Is it not monstrous that t
his player here,
    But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
    Could force his soul so to his o
wn conceit
    That, from her working, all his visage wann'd,
    Tears in his eyes, distraction i
n's aspect,
    A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
    With forms to his conceit? And 
all for nothing!
    For Hecuba!
    What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
    That he should we
ep for her? What would he do,
    Had he the motive and the cue for passion
    That I have? He wo
uld drown the stage with tears
    And cleave the general ear with horrid speech;
    Make mad the
 guilty and appal the free,
    Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed
    The very faculties of 
eyes and ears.
    Yet I,
    A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak
    Like John-a-dreams, unpre
gnant of my cause,
    And can say nothing! No, not for a king,
    Upon whose property and most d
ear life
    A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
    Who calls me villain? breaks my pate acr
oss?
    Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?
    Tweaks me by th' nose? gives me the lie 
i' th' throat
    As deep as to the lungs? Who does me this, ha?
    'Swounds, I should take it! f
or it cannot be
    But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall
    To make oppression bitter, or ere th
is
    I should have fatted all the region kites
    With this slave's offal. Bloody bawdy villain
!
    Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
    O, vengeance!
    Why, what an a
ss am I! This is most brave,
    That I, the son of a dear father murther'd,
    Prompted to my re
venge by heaven and hell,
    Must (like a whore) unpack my heart with words
    And fall a-cursin
g like a very drab,
    A scullion!
    Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! Hum, I have heard
    T
hat guilty creatures, sitting at a play,
    Have by the very cunning of the scene
    Been struck
 so to the soul that presently
    They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
    For murther, thoug
h it have no tongue, will speak
    With most miraculous organ, I'll have these Players
    Play s
omething like the murther of my father
    Before mine uncle. I'll observe his looks;
    I'll ten
t him to the quick. If he but blench,
    I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
    May be
 a devil; and the devil hath power
    T' assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
    Out of my 
weakness and my melancholy,
    As he is very potent with such spirits,
    Abuses me to damn me. 
I'll have grounds
    More relative than this. The play's the thing
    Wherein I'll catch the con
science of the King.         Exit.

ACT III. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the C
astle.

Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern,
and Lords.

  King. An
d can you by no drift of circumstance
    Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
    Grating 
so harshly all his days of quiet
    With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
  Ros. He does confess h
e feels himself distracted,
    But from what cause he will by no means speak.
  Guil. Nor do we f
ind him forward to be sounded,
    But with a crafty madness keeps aloof
    When we would bring h
im on to some confession
    Of his true state.
  Queen. Did he receive you well?
  Ros. Most lik
e a gentleman.
  Guil. But with much forcing of his disposition.
  Ros. Niggard of question, but o
f our demands
    Most free in his reply.
  Queen. Did you assay him
    To any pastime?
  Ros. 
Madam, it so fell out that certain players
    We o'erraught on the way. Of these we told him,
   
 And there did seem in him a kind of joy
    To hear of it. They are here about the court,
    And
, as I think, they have already order
    This night to play before him.
  Pol. 'Tis most true;
 
   And he beseech'd me to entreat your Majesties
    To hear and see the matter.
  King. With all 
my heart, and it doth much content me
    To hear him so inclin'd.
    Good gentlemen, give him a 
further edge
    And drive his purpose on to these delights.
  Ros. We shall, my lord.
          
                  Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
  King. Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
    F
or we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
    That he, as 'twere by accident, may here
    Affron
t Ophelia.
    Her father and myself (lawful espials)
    Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing un
seen,
    We may of their encounter frankly judge
    And gather by him, as he is behav'd,
    If
't be th' affliction of his love, or no,
    That thus he suffers for.
  Queen. I shall obey you;

    And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
    That your good beauties be the happy cause
    Of H
amlet's wildness. So shall I hope your virtues
    Will bring him to his wonted way again,
    To 
both your honours.
  Oph. Madam, I wish it may.
                                                  
 [Exit Queen.]
  Pol. Ophelia, walk you here.- Gracious, so please you,
    We will bestow ourselv
es.- [To Ophelia] Read on this book,
    That show of such an exercise may colour
    Your lonelin
ess.- We are oft to blame in this,
    'Tis too much prov'd, that with devotion's visage
    And p
ious action we do sugar o'er
    The Devil himself.
  King. [aside] O, 'tis too true!
    How sma
rt a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
    The harlot's cheek, beautied with plast'ring art
,
    Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
    Than is my deed to my most painted word.
  
  O heavy burthen!
  Pol. I hear him coming. Let's withdraw, my lord.
                            
          Exeunt King and Polonius].

                           Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. To be, or
 not to be- that is the question:
    Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
    The slings and
 arrows of outrageous fortune
    Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
    And by opposing e
nd them. To die- to sleep-
    No more; and by a sleep to say we end
    The heartache, and the th
ousand natural shocks
    That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation
    Devoutly to be wish'd. To
 die- to sleep.
    To sleep- perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub!
    For in that sleep of de
ath what dreams may come
    When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
    Must give us pause. T
here's the respect
    That makes calamity of so long life.
    For who would bear the whips and s
corns of time,
    Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
    The pangs of despis'd lov
e, the law's delay,
    The insolence of office, and the spurns
    That patient merit of th' unwo
rthy takes,
    When he himself might his quietus make
    With a bare bodkin? Who would these far
dels bear,
    To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
    But that the dread of something after de
ath-
    The undiscover'd country, from whose bourn
    No traveller returns- puzzles the will,
 
   And makes us rather bear those ills we have
    Than fly to others that we know not of?
    Thu
s conscience does make cowards of us all,
    And thus the native hue of resolution
    Is sicklie
d o'er with the pale cast of thought,
    And enterprises of great pith and moment
    With this r
egard their currents turn awry
    And lose the name of action.- Soft you now!
    The fair Opheli
a!- Nymph, in thy orisons
    Be all my sins rememb'red.
  Oph. Good my lord,
    How does your h
onour for this many a day?
  Ham. I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
  Oph. My lord, I have rem
embrances of yours
    That I have longed long to re-deliver.
    I pray you, now receive them.
 
 Ham. No, not I!
    I never gave you aught.
  Oph. My honour'd lord, you know right well you did,

    And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd
    As made the things more rich. Their perfu
me lost,
    Take these again; for to the noble mind
    Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unk
ind.
    There, my lord.
  Ham. Ha, ha! Are you honest?
  Oph. My lord?
  Ham. Are you fair?
  
Oph. What means your lordship?
  Ham. That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit
no

    discourse to your beauty.
  Oph. Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with
hones
ty?
  Ham. Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform
    honesty from what it is to
 a bawd than the force of honesty
can
    translate beauty into his likeness. This was sometime a

paradox,
    but now the time gives it proof. I did love you once.
  Oph. Indeed, my lord, you ma
de me believe so.
  Ham. You should not have believ'd me; for virtue cannot so
    inoculate our o
ld stock but we shall relish of it. I loved
you
    not.
  Oph. I was the more deceived.
  Ham. 
Get thee to a nunnery! Why wouldst thou be a breeder of
    sinners? I am myself indifferent honest
, but yet I could
accuse
    me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne
me.
 
   I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more offences at
my
    beck than I have thoughts 
to put them in, imagination to give
    them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellow
s
as I
    do, crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves
all;
    believe none of 
us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where's your
    father?
  Oph. At home, my lord.
  Ham. Let the do
ors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool
    nowhere but in's own house. Farewell.
  Oph. O
, help him, you sweet heavens!
  Ham. If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy
dowry
:
    be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not
escape
    calumny. Get thee to a
 nunnery. Go, farewell. Or if thou wilt
    needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enoug
h what
    monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go; and quickly too.
    Farewell.
  Oph. O h
eavenly powers, restore him!
  Ham. I have heard of your paintings too, well enough. God hath
    
given you one face, and you make yourselves another. You jig,
you
    amble, and you lisp; you nic
kname God's creatures and make
your
    wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't! it ha
th
made
    me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages. Those that are
    married already- al
l but one- shall live; the rest shall keep
as
    they are. To a nunnery, go.                     
       Exit.
  Oph. O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
    The courtier's, scholar's, soldie
r's, eye, tongue, sword,
    Th' expectancy and rose of the fair state,
    The glass of fashion a
nd the mould of form,
    Th' observ'd of all observers- quite, quite down!
    And I, of ladies m
ost deject and wretched,
    That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
    Now see that noble and m
ost sovereign reason,
    Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
    That unmatch'd form
 and feature of blown youth
    Blasted with ecstasy. O, woe is me
    T' have seen what I have se
en, see what I see!

                   Enter King and Polonius.

  King. Love? his affections d
o not that way tend;
    Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,
    Was not like madne
ss. There's something in his soul
    O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
    And I do doubt 
the hatch and the disclose
    Will be some danger; which for to prevent,
    I have in quick dete
rmination
    Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England
    For the demand of our neglected
 tribute.
    Haply the seas, and countries different,
    With variable objects, shall expel
   
 This something-settled matter in his heart,
    Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
  
  From fashion of himself. What think you on't?
  Pol. It shall do well. But yet do I believe
    
The origin and commencement of his grief
    Sprung from neglected love.- How now, Ophelia?
    Yo
u need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said.
    We heard it all.- My lord, do as you please;
    But
 if you hold it fit, after the play
    Let his queen mother all alone entreat him
    To show his
 grief. Let her be round with him;
    And I'll be plac'd so please you, in the ear
    Of all the
ir conference. If she find him not,
    To England send him; or confine him where
    Your wisdom 
best shall think.
  King. It shall be so.
    Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.        
 Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. hall in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet and three of the Players.


  Ham. Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounc'd it to you,
    trippingly on the tongue. B
ut if you mouth it, as many of our
    players do, I had as live the town crier spoke my lines. Nor

do
    not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all
    gently; for in the very to
rrent, tempest, and (as I may say)
    whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and beget a
   
 temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to
the
    soul to hear a robustious per
iwig-pated fellow tear a passion
to
    tatters, to very rags, to split the cars of the groundling
s,
who
    (for the most part) are capable of nothing but inexplicable
dumb
    shows and noise.
 I would have such a fellow whipp'd for
o'erdoing
    Termagant. It out-herods Herod. Pray you avo
id it.
  Player. I warrant your honour.
  Ham. Be not too tame neither; but let your own discretio
n be
your
    tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the action;
with
    this special 
observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of
    nature: for anything so overdone is from the p
urpose of
playing,
    whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as
    'twere, 
the mirror up to nature; to show Virtue her own
feature,
    scorn her own image, and the very age
 and body of the time
his
    form and pressure. Now this overdone, or come tardy off,
though
  
  it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious
    grieve; the censure of the which o
ne must in your allowance
    o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that
I
   
 have seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly (not
to
    speak it profanely), that, n
either having the accent of
    Christians, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have
so
  
  strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of Nature's
    journeymen had made men, and not m
ade them well, they
imitated
    humanity so abominably.
  Player. I hope we have reform'd that i
ndifferently with us,
sir.
  Ham. O, reform it altogether! And let those that play your
clowns
 
   speak no more than is set down for them. For there be of them
    that will themselves laugh, to
 set on some quantity of barren
    spectators to laugh too, though in the mean time some
necessar
y
    question of the play be then to be considered. That's
villanous
    and shows a most pitifu
l ambition in the fool that uses it.
Go
    make you ready.
                                     
            Exeunt Players.

            Enter Polonius, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.

    How
 now, my lord? Will the King hear this piece of work?
  Pol. And the Queen too, and that presently.

  Ham. Bid the players make haste, [Exit Polonius.] Will you two
    help to hasten them?
  Both
. We will, my lord.                       Exeunt they two.
  Ham. What, ho, Horatio!

           
           Enter Horatio.

  Hor. Here, sweet lord, at your service.
  Ham. Horatio, thou art e'e
n as just a man
    As e'er my conversation cop'd withal.
  Hor. O, my dear lord!
  Ham. Nay, do 
not think I flatter;
    For what advancement may I hope from thee,
    That no revenue hast but t
hy good spirits
    To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
    No, let the can
died tongue lick absurd pomp,
    And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
    Where thrift may f
ollow fawning. Dost thou hear?
    Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
    And could of 
men distinguish, her election
    Hath seal'd thee for herself. For thou hast been
    As one, in 
suff'ring all, that suffers nothing;
    A man that Fortune's buffets and rewards
    Hast ta'en w
ith equal thanks; and blest are those
    Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled
    That
 they are not a pipe for Fortune's finger
    To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
    
That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
    In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,

    As I do thee. Something too much of this I
    There is a play to-night before the King.
    
One scene of it comes near the circumstance,
    Which I have told thee, of my father's death.
   
 I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
    Even with the very comment of thy soul
    Observe
 my uncle. If his occulted guilt
    Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
    It is a damned ghos
t that we have seen,
    And my imaginations are as foul
    As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful 
note;
    For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,
    And after we will both our judgments join
 
   In censure of his seeming.
  Hor. Well, my lord.
    If he steal aught the whilst this play is 
playing,
    And scape detecting, I will pay the theft.

    Sound a flourish. [Enter Trumpets an
d Kettledrums. Danish
    march. [Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz,
      Guilden
stern, and other Lords attendant, with the Guard
                       carrying torches.

  Ham.
 They are coming to the play. I must be idle.
    Get you a place.
  King. How fares our cousin Ha
mlet?
  Ham. Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish. I eat the
air,
    promise-cramm'd. Yo
u cannot feed capons so.
  King. I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet. These words are
not
   
 mine.
  Ham. No, nor mine now. [To Polonius] My lord, you play'd once
    i' th' university, you 
say?
  Pol. That did I, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.
  Ham. What did you enact?
  Pol
. I did enact Julius Caesar; I was kill'd i' th' Capitol;
Brutus
    kill'd me.
  Ham. It was a b
rute part of him to kill so capital a calf
there. Be
    the players ready.
  Ros. Ay, my lord. T
hey stay upon your patience.
  Queen. Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
  Ham. No, good moth
er. Here's metal more attractive.
  Pol. [to the King] O, ho! do you mark that?
  Ham. Lady, shall
 I lie in your lap?
                                  [Sits down at Ophelia's feet.]

  Oph. No, 
my lord.
  Ham. I mean, my head upon your lap?
  Oph. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Do you think I meant co
untry matters?
  Oph. I think nothing, my lord.
  Ham. That's a fair thought to lie between maids'
 legs.
  Oph. What is, my lord?
  Ham. Nothing.
  Oph. You are merry, my lord.
  Ham. Who, I?
 
 Oph. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. O God, your only jig-maker! What should a man do but be
merry?
    For 
look you how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father
died
    within 's two hours.
  Oph. Nay '
tis twice two months, my lord.
  Ham. So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I'll have
a

    suit of sables. O heavens! die two months ago, and not
forgotten
    yet? Then there's hope 
a great man's memory may outlive his
life
    half a year. But, by'r Lady, he must build churches 
then; or
else
    shall he suffer not thinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose

    epitaph is '
For O, for O, the hobby-horse is forgot!'

               Hautboys play. The dumb show enters.


    Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing
    him and he her. She kneels, and
 makes show of protestation
    unto him. He takes her up, and declines his head upon her
    neck
. He lays him down upon a bank of flowers. She, seeing
    him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a 
fellow, takes off his
    crown, kisses it, pours poison in the sleeper's ears, and
    leaves him
. The Queen returns, finds the King dead, and makes
    passionate action. The Poisoner with some t
hree or four
Mutes,
    comes in again, seem to condole with her. The dead body is
    carried aw
ay. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with gifts; she
    seems harsh and unwilling awhile, but in the e
nd accepts
    his love.
                                                         Exeunt.

  Oph
. What means this, my lord?
  Ham. Marry, this is miching malhecho; it means mischief.
  Oph. Beli
ke this show imports the argument of the play.

                      Enter Prologue.

  Ham. We
 shall know by this fellow. The players cannot keep
counsel;
    they'll tell all.
  Oph. Will he
 tell us what this show meant?
  Ham. Ay, or any show that you'll show him. Be not you asham'd
to

    show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means.
  Oph. You are naught, you are naught! I'll m
ark the play.

    Pro. For us, and for our tragedy,
      Here stooping to your clemency,
     
 We beg your hearing patiently.                     [Exit.]

  Ham. Is this a prologue, or the pos
y of a ring?
  Oph. 'Tis brief, my lord.
  Ham. As woman's love.

              Enter [two Playe
rs as] King and Queen.

    King. Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round
      Neptune's
 salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
      And thirty dozen moons with borrowed sheen
      About 
the world have times twelve thirties been,
      Since love our hearts, and Hymen did our hands,
 
     Unite comutual in most sacred bands.
    Queen. So many journeys may the sun and moon
      M
ake us again count o'er ere love be done!
      But woe is me! you are so sick of late,
      So f
ar from cheer and from your former state.
      That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
     
 Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must;
      For women's fear and love holds quantity,
      I
n neither aught, or in extremity.
      Now what my love is, proof hath made you know;
      And a
s my love is siz'd, my fear is so.
      Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
      
Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.
    King. Faith, I must leave thee, love, an
d shortly too;
      My operant powers their functions leave to do.
      And thou shalt live in t
his fair world behind,
      Honour'd, belov'd, and haply one as kind
      For husband shalt thou
-
    Queen. O, confound the rest!
      Such love must needs be treason in my breast.
      When
 second husband let me be accurst!
      None wed the second but who killed the first.

  Ham. [a
side] Wormwood, wormwood!

    Queen. The instances that second marriage move
      Are base resp
ects of thrift, but none of love.
      A second time I kill my husband dead
      When second hus
band kisses me in bed.
    King. I do believe you think what now you speak;
      But what we do d
etermine oft we break.
      Purpose is but the slave to memory,
      Of violent birth, but poor 
validity;
      Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree,
      But fall unshaken when the
y mellow be.
      Most necessary 'tis that we forget
      To pay ourselves what to ourselves is 
debt.
      What to ourselves in passion we propose,
      The passion ending, doth the purpose lo
se.
      The violence of either grief or joy
      Their own enactures with themselves destroy.

      Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
      Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender acci
dent.
      This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
      That even our loves should with 
our fortunes change;
      For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
      Whether love lead fortu
ne, or else fortune love.
      The great man down, you mark his favourite flies,
      The poor a
dvanc'd makes friends of enemies;
      And hitherto doth love on fortune tend,
      For who not 
needs shall never lack a friend,
      And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
      Directly se
asons him his enemy.
      But, orderly to end where I begun,
      Our wills and fates do so cont
rary run
      That our devices still are overthrown;
      Our thoughts are ours, their ends none
 of our own.
      So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
      But die thy thoughts when thy f
irst lord is dead.
    Queen. Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light,
      Sport and repose 
lock from me day and night,
      To desperation turn my trust and hope,
      An anchor's cheer i
n prison be my scope,
      Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
      Meet what I would have
 well, and it destroy,
      Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
      If, once a widow,
 ever I be wife!

  Ham. If she should break it now!

    King. 'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave 
me here awhile.
      My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile
      The tedious day with sl
eep.
    Queen. Sleep rock thy brain,
                                                    [He] sle
eps.
      And never come mischance between us twain!
Exit.

  Ham. Madam, how like you this pla
y?
  Queen. The lady doth protest too much, methinks.
  Ham. O, but she'll keep her word.
  King.
 Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in't?
  Ham. No, no! They do but jest, poison in 
jest; no offence i'
th'
    world.
  King. What do you call the play?
  Ham. 'The Mousetrap.' Ma
rry, how? Tropically. This play is the
    image of a murther done in Vienna. Gonzago is the duke's

name;
    his wife, Baptista. You shall see anon. 'Tis a knavish piece
of
    work; but what o'
 that? Your Majesty, and we that have free
    souls, it touches us not. Let the gall'd jade winch;
 our
withers
    are unwrung.

                         Enter Lucianus.

    This is one Lucia
nus, nephew to the King.
  Oph. You are as good as a chorus, my lord.
  Ham. I could interpret bet
ween you and your love, if I could
see
    the puppets dallying.
  Oph. You are keen, my lord, yo
u are keen.
  Ham. It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
  Oph. Still better, and wors
e.
  Ham. So you must take your husbands.- Begin, murtherer. Pox,
leave
    thy damnable faces, a
nd begin! Come, the croaking raven doth
    bellow for revenge.

    Luc. Thoughts black, hands a
pt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
      Confederate season, else no creature seeing;
      Thou mi
xture rank, of midnight weeds collected,
      With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,

      Thy natural magic and dire property
      On wholesome life usurp immediately.
             
                      Pours the poison in his ears.

  Ham. He poisons him i' th' garden for's est
ate. His name's
Gonzago.
    The story is extant, and written in very choice Italian. You
    sha
ll see anon how the murtherer gets the love of Gonzago's
wife.
  Oph. The King rises.
  Ham. What
, frighted with false fire?
  Queen. How fares my lord?
  Pol. Give o'er the play.
  King. Give m
e some light! Away!
  All. Lights, lights, lights!
                              Exeunt all but Ha
mlet and Horatio.
  Ham.   Why, let the strucken deer go weep,
          The hart ungalled play;

         For some must watch, while some must sleep:
          Thus runs the world away.
    Would
 not this, sir, and a forest of feathers- if the rest of
my
    fortunes turn Turk with me-with tw
o Provincial roses on my
raz'd
    shoes, get me a fellowship in a cry of players, sir?
  Hor. Ha
lf a share.
  Ham.   A whole one I!
         For thou dost know, O Damon dear,
           This re
alm dismantled was
         Of Jove himself; and now reigns here
           A very, very- pajock.

  Hor. You might have rhym'd.
  Ham. O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand
  
  pound! Didst perceive?
  Hor. Very well, my lord.
  Ham. Upon the talk of the poisoning?
  Hor.
 I did very well note him.
  Ham.   Aha! Come, some music! Come, the recorders!
         For if th
e King like not the comedy,
         Why then, belike he likes it not, perdy.
    Come, some music
!

                Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Guil. Good my lord, vouchsafe me a wor
d with you.
  Ham. Sir, a whole history.
  Guil. The King, sir-
  Ham. Ay, sir, what of him?
  G
uil. Is in his retirement, marvellous distemper'd.
  Ham. With drink, sir?
  Guil. No, my lord; ra
ther with choler.
  Ham. Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this
to
    the do
ctor; for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps
    plunge him into far more choler.
  Guil
. Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame, and
start
    not so wildly from my affair.
 
 Ham. I am tame, sir; pronounce.
  Guil. The Queen, your mother, in most great affliction of
spiri
t
    hath sent me to you.
  Ham. You are welcome.
  Guil. Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is no
t of the right
breed.
    If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, I will
do
    yo
ur mother's commandment; if not, your pardon and my return
    shall be the end of my business.
  
Ham. Sir, I cannot.
  Guil. What, my lord?
  Ham. Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseas'd. 
But, sir,
such
    answer as I can make, you shall command; or rather, as you
say,
    my mother
. Therefore no more, but to the matter! My mother,
you
    say-
  Ros. Then thus she says: your b
ehaviour hath struck her into
    amazement and admiration.
  Ham. O wonderful son, that can so st
onish a mother! But is
there no
    sequel at the heels of this mother's admiration? Impart.
  Ro
s. She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to
bed.
  Ham. We shall obey, were she t
en times our mother. Have you any
    further trade with us?
  Ros. My lord, you once did love me.

  Ham. And do still, by these pickers and stealers!
  Ros. Good my lord, what is your cause of di
stemper? You do
surely
    bar the door upon your own liberty, if you deny your griefs
to
    yo
ur friend.
  Ham. Sir, I lack advancement.
  Ros. How can that be, when you have the voice of the 
King
himself
    for your succession in Denmark?
  Ham. Ay, sir, but 'while the grass grows'- the
 proverb is
something
    musty.

                     Enter the Players with recorders.

    
O, the recorders! Let me see one. To withdraw with you- why
do
    you go about to recover the win
d of me, as if you would drive
me
    into a toil?
  Guil. O my lord, if my duty be too bold, my 
love is too
unmannerly.
  Ham. I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this
pipe?
  Gu
il. My lord, I cannot.
  Ham. I pray you.
  Guil. Believe me, I cannot.
  Ham. I do beseech you.

  Guil. I know, no touch of it, my lord.
  Ham. It is as easy as lying. Govern these ventages with
 your
    fingers and thumbs, give it breath with your mouth, and it
will
    discourse most eloq
uent music. Look you, these are the stops.
  Guil. But these cannot I command to any utt'rance of h
armony. I
    have not the skill.
  Ham. Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me!

You
    would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you
would
    pluck out the heart of
 my mystery; you would sound me from my
    lowest note to the top of my compass; and there is much

music,
    excellent voice, in this little organ, yet cannot you make it
    speak. 'Sblood, do 
you think I am easier to be play'd on than
a
    pipe? Call me what instrument you will, though yo
u can fret
me,
    you cannot play upon me.

                        Enter Polonius.

    God 
bless you, sir!
  Pol. My lord, the Queen would speak with you, and presently.
  Ham. Do you see y
onder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
  Pol. By th' mass, and 'tis like a camel indeed.
 
 Ham. Methinks it is like a weasel.
  Pol. It is back'd like a weasel.
  Ham. Or like a whale.
  
Pol. Very like a whale.
  Ham. Then will I come to my mother by-and-by.- They fool me to
the
    
top of my bent.- I will come by-and-by.
  Pol. I will say so.                                      
Exit.
  Ham. 'By-and-by' is easily said.- Leave me, friends.
                                     
   [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]

    'Tis now the very witching time of night,
    When churchyards y
awn, and hell itself breathes out
    Contagion to this world. Now could I drink hot blood
    And
 do such bitter business as the day
    Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother!
    O hear
t, lose not thy nature; let not ever
    The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom.
    Let me be cru
el, not unnatural;
    I will speak daggers to her, but use none.
    My tongue and soul in this b
e hypocrites-
    How in my words somever she be shent,
    To give them seals never, my soul, con
sent!             Exit.




Scene III.
A room in the Castle.

Enter King, Rosencrantz, and G
uildenstern.

  King. I like him not, nor stands it safe with us
    To let his madness range. Th
erefore prepare you;
    I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
    And he to England shall al
ong with you.
    The terms of our estate may not endure
    Hazard so near us as doth hourly grow

    Out of his lunacies.
  Guil. We will ourselves provide.
    Most holy and religious fear it 
is
    To keep those many many bodies safe
    That live and feed upon your Majesty.
  Ros. The s
ingle and peculiar life is bound
    With all the strength and armour of the mind
    To keep itse
lf from noyance; but much more
    That spirit upon whose weal depends and rests
    The lives of 
many. The cesse of majesty
    Dies not alone, but like a gulf doth draw
    What's near it with i
t. It is a massy wheel,
    Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,
    To whose huge spokes ten
 thousand lesser things
    Are mortis'd and adjoin'd; which when it falls,
    Each small annexme
nt, petty consequence,
    Attends the boist'rous ruin. Never alone
    Did the king sigh, but wit
h a general groan.
  King. Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;
    For we will fetters put
 upon this fear,
    Which now goes too free-footed.
  Both. We will haste us.
                  
                             Exeunt Gentlemen.

                   Enter Polonius.

  Pol. My lo
rd, he's going to his mother's closet.
    Behind the arras I'll convey myself
    To hear the pro
cess. I'll warrant she'll tax him home;
    And, as you said, and wisely was it said,
    'Tis mee
t that some more audience than a mother,
    Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear
    
The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege.
    I'll call upon you ere you go to bed
    And 
tell you what I know.
  King. Thanks, dear my lord.
                                              
  Exit [Polonius].
    O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven;
    It hath the primal eldest c
urse upon't,
    A brother's murther! Pray can I not,
    Though inclination be as sharp as will.

    My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent,
    And, like a man to double business bound,
   
 I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
    And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
    We
re thicker than itself with brother's blood,
    Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
   
 To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
    But to confront the visage of offence?
    And
 what's in prayer but this twofold force,
    To be forestalled ere we come to fall,
    Or pardon
'd being down? Then I'll look up;
    My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer
    Can serve 
my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murther'?
    That cannot be; since I am still possess'd
    Of those
 effects for which I did the murther-
    My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.
    May one b
e pardon'd and retain th' offence?
    In the corrupted currents of this world
    Offence's gilde
d hand may shove by justice,
    And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
    Buys out the law; b
ut 'tis not so above.
    There is no shuffling; there the action lies
    In his true nature, and
 we ourselves compell'd,
    Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
    To give in evidence
. What then? What rests?
    Try what repentance can. What can it not?
    Yet what can it when on
e cannot repent?
    O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
    O limed soul, that, struggling 
to be free,
    Art more engag'd! Help, angels! Make assay.
    Bow, stubborn knees; and heart wit
h strings of steel,
    Be soft as sinews of the new-born babe!
    All may be well.              
                    He kneels.

                         Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Now might I do it
 pat, now he is praying;
    And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven,
    And so am I reveng'd
. That would be scann'd.
    A villain kills my father; and for that,
    I, his sole son, do this
 same villain send
    To heaven.
    Why, this is hire and salary, not revenge!
    He took my f
ather grossly, full of bread,
    With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
    And how hi
s audit stands, who knows save heaven?
    But in our circumstance and course of thought,
    'Tis
 heavy with him; and am I then reveng'd,
    To take him in the purging of his soul,
    When he i
s fit and seasoned for his passage?
    No.
    Up, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent.
    
When he is drunk asleep; or in his rage;
    Or in th' incestuous pleasure of his bed;
    At gami
ng, swearing, or about some act
    That has no relish of salvation in't-
    Then trip him, that 
his heels may kick at heaven,
    And that his soul may be as damn'd and black
    As hell, wheret
o it goes. My mother stays.
    This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.              Exit.
  Kin
g. [rises] My words fly up, my thoughts remain below.
    Words without thoughts never to heaven go
.             Exit.




Scene IV.
The Queen's closet.

Enter Queen and Polonius.

  Pol. H
e will come straight. Look you lay home to him.
    Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear
 with,
    And that your Grace hath screen'd and stood between
    Much heat and him. I'll silence
 me even here.
    Pray you be round with him.
  Ham. (within) Mother, mother, mother!
  Queen. I
'll warrant you; fear me not. Withdraw; I hear him
coming.
                              [Polonius
 hides behind the arras.]

                          Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Now, mother, what's t
he matter?
  Queen. Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
  Ham. Mother, you have my father 
much offended.
  Queen. Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
  Ham. Go, go, you question wi
th a wicked tongue.
  Queen. Why, how now, Hamlet?
  Ham. What's the matter now?
  Queen. Have yo
u forgot me?
  Ham. No, by the rood, not so!
    You are the Queen, your husband's brother's wife,

    And (would it were not so!) you are my mother.
  Queen. Nay, then I'll set those to you that 
can speak.
  Ham. Come, come, and sit you down. You shall not budge;
    You go not till I set you
 up a glass
    Where you may see the inmost part of you.
  Queen. What wilt thou do? Thou wilt no
t murther me?
    Help, help, ho!
  Pol. [behind] What, ho! help, help, help!
  Ham. [draws] How 
now? a rat? Dead for a ducat, dead!
            [Makes a pass through the arras and] kills Polonius
.
  Pol. [behind] O, I am slain!
  Queen. O me, what hast thou done?
  Ham. Nay, I know not. Is i
t the King?
  Queen. O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
  Ham. A bloody deed- almost as bad, 
good mother,
    As kill a king, and marry with his brother.
  Queen. As kill a king?
  Ham. Ay, 
lady, it was my word.
                         [Lifts up the arras and sees Polonius.]
    Thou wr
etched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
    I took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune.
    Thou
 find'st to be too busy is some danger.
    Leave wringing of your hands. Peace! sit you down
    
And let me wring your heart; for so I shall
    If it be made of penetrable stuff;
    If damned c
ustom have not braz'd it so
    That it is proof and bulwark against sense.
  Queen. What have I d
one that thou dar'st wag thy tongue
    In noise so rude against me?
  Ham. Such an act
    That 
blurs the grace and blush of modesty;
    Calls virtue hypocrite; takes off the rose
    From the 
fair forehead of an innocent love,
    And sets a blister there; makes marriage vows
    As false 
as dicers' oaths. O, such a deed
    As from the body of contraction plucks
    The very soul, and
 sweet religion makes
    A rhapsody of words! Heaven's face doth glow;
    Yea, this solidity and
 compound mass,
    With tristful visage, as against the doom,
    Is thought-sick at the act.
  
Queen. Ah me, what act,
    That roars so loud and thunders in the index?
  Ham. Look here upon th
's picture, and on this,
    The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
    See what a grace was
 seated on this brow;
    Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
    An eye like Mars, to th
reaten and command;
    A station like the herald Mercury
    New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill
:
    A combination and a form indeed
    Where every god did seem to set his seal
    To give th
e world assurance of a man.
    This was your husband. Look you now what follows.
    Here is your
 husband, like a mildew'd ear
    Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
    Could you on 
this fair mountain leave to feed,
    And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes
    You cannot ca
ll it love; for at your age
    The heyday in the blood is tame, it's humble,
    And waits upon t
he judgment; and what judgment
    Would step from this to this? Sense sure you have,
    Else cou
ld you not have motion; but sure that sense
    Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,
    Nor s
ense to ecstacy was ne'er so thrall'd
    But it reserv'd some quantity of choice
    To serve in 
such a difference. What devil was't
    That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
    Eyes with
out feeling, feeling without sight,
    Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
    Or but 
a sickly part of one true sense
    Could not so mope.
    O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious
 hell,
    If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
    To flaming youth let virtue be as wax
  
  And melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame
    When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
   
 Since frost itself as actively doth burn,
    And reason panders will.
  Queen. O Hamlet, speak n
o more!
    Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul,
    And there I see such black and grained s
pots
    As will not leave their tinct.
  Ham. Nay, but to live
    In the rank sweat of an ensea
med bed,
    Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love
    Over the nasty sty!
  Queen. O, s
peak to me no more!
    These words like daggers enter in mine ears.
    No more, sweet Hamlet!
 
 Ham. A murtherer and a villain!
    A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
    Of your prec
edent lord; a vice of kings;
    A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
    That from a shelf the 
precious diadem stole
    And put it in his pocket!
  Queen. No more!

                Enter the
 Ghost in his nightgown.

  Ham. A king of shreds and patches!-
    Save me and hover o'er me wit
h your wings,
    You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?
  Queen. Alas, he's mad!

  Ham. Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
    That, laps'd in time and passion, lets go by
 
   Th' important acting of your dread command?
    O, say!
  Ghost. Do not forget. This visitation

    Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
    But look, amazement on thy mother sits.
    O
, step between her and her fighting soul
    Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works.
    Speak 
to her, Hamlet.
  Ham. How is it with you, lady?
  Queen. Alas, how is't with you,
    That you d
o bend your eye on vacancy,
    And with th' encorporal air do hold discourse?
    Forth at your e
yes your spirits wildly peep;
    And, as the sleeping soldiers in th' alarm,
    Your bedded hair
s, like life in excrements,
    Start up and stand an end. O gentle son,
    Upon the heat and fla
me of thy distemper
    Sprinkle cool patience! Whereon do you look?
  Ham. On him, on him! Look y
ou how pale he glares!
    His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
    Would make them 
capable.- Do not look upon me,
    Lest with this piteous action you convert
    My stern effects.
 Then what I have to do
    Will want true colour- tears perchance for blood.
  Queen. To whom do 
you speak this?
  Ham. Do you see nothing there?
  Queen. Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.

  Ham. Nor did you nothing hear?
  Queen. No, nothing but ourselves.
  Ham. Why, look you there! L
ook how it steals away!
    My father, in his habit as he liv'd!
    Look where he goes even now o
ut at the portal!
                                                     Exit Ghost.
  Queen. This i
s the very coinage of your brain.
    This bodiless creation ecstasy
    Is very cunning in.
  Ha
m. Ecstasy?
    My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time
    And makes as healthful music. It 
is not madness
    That I have utt'red. Bring me to the test,
    And I the matter will reword; wh
ich madness
    Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
    Lay not that flattering unction 
to your soul
    That not your trespass but my madness speaks.
    It will but skin and film the u
lcerous place,
    Whiles rank corruption, mining all within,
    Infects unseen. Confess yourself
 to heaven;
    Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
    And do not spread the compost on th
e weeds
    To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;
    For in the fatness of these pursy 
times
    Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg-
    Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.

  Queen. O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
  Ham. O, throw away the worser part of it,

    And live the purer with the other half,
    Good night- but go not to my uncle's bed.
    Assu
me a virtue, if you have it not.
    That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat
    Of habits ev
il, is angel yet in this,
    That to the use of actions fair and good
    He likewise gives a fro
ck or livery,
    That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,
    And that shall lend a kind of easine
ss
    To the next abstinence; the next more easy;
    For use almost can change the stamp of natu
re,
    And either [master] the devil, or throw him out
    With wondrous potency. Once more, good
 night;
    And when you are desirous to be blest,
    I'll blessing beg of you.- For this same lo
rd,
    I do repent; but heaven hath pleas'd it so,
    To punish me with this, and this with me,

    That I must be their scourge and minister.
    I will bestow him, and will answer well
    Th
e death I gave him. So again, good night.
    I must be cruel, only to be kind;
    Thus bad begin
s, and worse remains behind.
    One word more, good lady.
  Queen. What shall I do?
  Ham. Not t
his, by no means, that I bid you do:
    Let the bloat King tempt you again to bed;
    Pinch want
on on your cheek; call you his mouse;
    And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
    Or paddlin
g in your neck with his damn'd fingers,
    Make you to ravel all this matter out,
    That I esse
ntially am not in madness,
    But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;
    For who that's 
but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
    Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib
    Such dear concerni
ngs hide? Who would do so?
    No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
    Unpeg the basket on the ho
use's top,
    Let the birds fly, and like the famous ape,
    To try conclusions, in the basket c
reep
    And break your own neck down.
  Queen. Be thou assur'd, if words be made of breath,
    
And breath of life, I have no life to breathe
    What thou hast said to me.
  Ham. I must to Engl
and; you know that?
  Queen. Alack,
    I had forgot! 'Tis so concluded on.
  Ham. There's letter
s seal'd; and my two schoolfellows,
    Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,
    They bear t
he mandate; they must sweep my way
    And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
    For 'tis the sp
ort to have the enginer
    Hoist with his own petar; and 't shall go hard
    But I will delve on
e yard below their mines
    And blow them at the moon. O, 'tis most sweet
    When in one line tw
o crafts directly meet.
    This man shall set me packing.
    I'll lug the guts into the neighbou
r room.-
    Mother, good night.- Indeed, this counsellor
    Is now most still, most secret, and 
most grave,
    Who was in life a foolish peating knave.
    Come, sir, to draw toward an end with
 you.
    Good night, mother.
                  [Exit the Queen. Then] Exit Hamlet, tugging in
  
                                                     Polonius.

ACT IV. Scene I.

Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King and Queen, with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  K
ing. There's matter in these sighs. These profound heaves
    You must translate; 'tis fit we under
stand them.
    Where is your son?
  Queen. Bestow this place on us a little while.
             
             [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
    Ah, mine own lord, what have I seen to-nigh
t!
  King. What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
  Queen. Mad as the sea and wind when both contend
  
  Which is the mightier. In his lawless fit
    Behind the arras hearing something stir,
    Whips
 out his rapier, cries 'A rat, a rat!'
    And in this brainish apprehension kills
    The unseen 
good old man.
  King. O heavy deed!
    It had been so with us, had we been there.
    His libert
y is full of threats to all-
    To you yourself, to us, to every one.
    Alas, how shall this bl
oody deed be answer'd?
    It will be laid to us, whose providence
    Should have kept short, res
train'd, and out of haunt
    This mad young man. But so much was our love
    We would not unders
tand what was most fit,
    But, like the owner of a foul disease,
    To keep it from divulging, 
let it feed
    Even on the pith of life. Where is he gone?
  Queen. To draw apart the body he hat
h kill'd;
    O'er whom his very madness, like some ore
    Among a mineral of metals base,
    S
hows itself pure. He weeps for what is done.
  King. O Gertrude, come away!
    The sun no sooner 
shall the mountains touch
    But we will ship him hence; and this vile deed
    We must with all 
our majesty and skill
    Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!

             Enter Rose
ncrantz and Guildenstern.

    Friends both, go join you with some further aid.
    Hamlet in mad
ness hath Polonius slain,
    And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him.
    Go seek him ou
t; speak fair, and bring the body
    Into the chapel. I pray you haste in this.
                 
         Exeunt [Rosencrantz and Guildenstern].
    Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friend
s
    And let them know both what we mean to do
    And what's untimely done. [So haply slander-]

    Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter,
    As level as the cannon to his blank,
    Transpo
rts his poisoned shot- may miss our name
    And hit the woundless air.- O, come away!
    My soul
 is full of discord and dismay.
                                                         Exeunt.





Scene II.
Elsinore. A passage in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Safely stow'd.
  Ge
ntlemen. (within) Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!
  Ham. But soft! What noise? Who calls on Hamlet? O, here th
ey
come.

               Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Ros. What have you done, my lor
d, with the dead body?
  Ham. Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
  Ros. Tell us where 'tis
, that we may take it thence
    And bear it to the chapel.
  Ham. Do not believe it.
  Ros. Beli
eve what?
  Ham. That I can keep your counsel, and not mine own. Besides,
to be
    demanded of a
 sponge, what replication should be made by the
son
    of a king?
  Ros. Take you me for a spong
e, my lord?
  Ham. Ay, sir; that soaks up the King's countenance, his
rewards,
    his authoritie
s. But such officers do the King best service
in
    the end. He keeps them, like an ape, in the c
orner of his
jaw;
    first mouth'd, to be last swallowed. When he needs what you
have
    glean
'd, it is but squeezing you and, sponge, you shall be
dry
    again.
  Ros. I understand you not,
 my lord.
  Ham. I am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.
  Ros. My lord, you mu
st tell us where the body is and go with us
to
    the King.
  Ham. The body is with the King, bu
t the King is not with the
body.
    The King is a thing-
  Guil. A thing, my lord?
  Ham. Of no
thing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.
                                                  
       Exeunt.




Scene III.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King.

  King. I have
 sent to seek him and to find the body.
    How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
    Yet 
must not we put the strong law on him.
    He's lov'd of the distracted multitude,
    Who like no
t in their judgment, but their eyes;
    And where 'tis so, th' offender's scourge is weigh'd,
   
 But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,
    This sudden sending him away must seem
  
  Deliberate pause. Diseases desperate grown
    By desperate appliance are reliev'd,
    Or not a
t all.

                    Enter Rosencrantz.

    How now O What hath befall'n?
  Ros. Where 
the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
    We cannot get from him.
  King. But where is he?
  Ros. W
ithout, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
  King. Bring him before us.
  Ros. Ho, Guildenst
ern! Bring in my lord.

        Enter Hamlet and Guildenstern [with Attendants].

  King. Now, H
amlet, where's Polonius?
  Ham. At supper.
  King. At supper? Where?
  Ham. Not where he eats, bu
t where he is eaten. A certain
    convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your worm is
your

    only emperor for diet. We fat all creatures else to fat us,
and
    we fat ourselves for mag
gots. Your fat king and your lean
beggar
    is but variable service- two dishes, but to one table
. That's
the
    end.
  King. Alas, alas!
  Ham. A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a
 king, and
eat
    of the fish that hath fed of that worm.
  King. What dost thou mean by this?

  Ham. Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress
through
    the guts of a beggar.
  K
ing. Where is Polonius?
  Ham. In heaven. Send thither to see. If your messenger find him
not
   
 there, seek him i' th' other place yourself. But indeed, if
you
    find him not within this mont
h, you shall nose him as you go
up
    the stair, into the lobby.
  King. Go seek him there. [To 
Attendants.]
  Ham. He will stay till you come.
                                            [Exeun
t Attendants.]
  King. Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,-
    Which we do tender as we
 dearly grieve
    For that which thou hast done,- must send thee hence
    With fiery quickness. 
Therefore prepare thyself.
    The bark is ready and the wind at help,
    Th' associates tend, an
d everything is bent
    For England.
  Ham. For England?
  King. Ay, Hamlet.
  Ham. Good.
  Ki
ng. So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
  Ham. I see a cherub that sees them. But come, for Eng
land!
    Farewell, dear mother.
  King. Thy loving father, Hamlet.
  Ham. My mother! Father and 
mother is man and wife; man and wife
is
    one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England!
Exit
.
  King. Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard.
    Delay it not; I'll have him hence t
o-night.
    Away! for everything is seal'd and done
    That else leans on th' affair. Pray you m
ake haste.
                            Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]
    And, England, if m
y love thou hold'st at aught,-
    As my great power thereof may give thee sense,
    Since yet th
y cicatrice looks raw and red
    After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
    Pays homage to us,-
 thou mayst not coldly set
    Our sovereign process, which imports at full,
    By letters congru
ing to that effect,
    The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;
    For like the hectic in my
 blood he rages,
    And thou must cure me. Till I know 'tis done,
    Howe'er my haps, my joys we
re ne'er begun.             Exit.

Scene IV.
Near Elsinore.

Enter Fortinbras
 with his Army over the stage.

  For. Go, Captain, from me greet the Danish king.
    Tell him t
hat by his license Fortinbras
    Craves the conveyance of a promis'd march
    Over his kingdom. 
You know the rendezvous.
    If that his Majesty would aught with us,
    We shall express our dut
y in his eye;
    And let him know so.
  Capt. I will do't, my lord.
  For. Go softly on.
      
                             Exeunt [all but the Captain].

       Enter Hamlet, Rosencrantz, [Gui
ldenstern,] and others.

  Ham. Good sir, whose powers are these?
  Capt. They are of Norway, sir
.
  Ham. How purpos'd, sir, I pray you?
  Capt. Against some part of Poland.
  Ham. Who commands 
them, sir?
  Capt. The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.
  Ham. Goes it against the main of Poland
, sir,
    Or for some frontier?
  Capt. Truly to speak, and with no addition,
    We go to gain 
a little patch of ground
    That hath in it no profit but the name.
    To pay five ducats, five,
 I would not farm it;
    Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
    A ranker rate, should it be 
sold in fee.
  Ham. Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
  Capt. Yes, it is already garrison
'd.
  Ham. Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
    Will not debate the question of this 
straw.
    This is th' imposthume of much wealth and peace,
    That inward breaks, and shows no c
ause without
    Why the man dies.- I humbly thank you, sir.
  Capt. God b' wi' you, sir.         
                    [Exit.]
  Ros. Will't please you go, my lord?
  Ham. I'll be with you straight
. Go a little before.
                                        [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]
    How all
 occasions do inform against me
    And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
    If his chief good
 and market of his time
    Be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.
    Sure he that made us w
ith such large discourse,
    Looking before and after, gave us not
    That capability and godlik
e reason
    To fust in us unus'd. Now, whether it be
    Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple

    Of thinking too precisely on th' event,-
    A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wi
sdom
    And ever three parts coward,- I do not know
    Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do
,'
    Sith I have cause, and will, and strength, and means
    To do't. Examples gross as earth e
xhort me.
    Witness this army of such mass and charge,
    Led by a delicate and tender prince,

    Whose spirit, with divine ambition puff'd,
    Makes mouths at the invisible event,
    Expos
ing what is mortal and unsure
    To all that fortune, death, and danger dare,
    Even for an egg
shell. Rightly to be great
    Is not to stir without great argument,
    But greatly to find quar
rel in a straw
    When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,
    That have a father kill'd, a 
mother stain'd,
    Excitements of my reason and my blood,
    And let all sleep, while to my sham
e I see
    The imminent death of twenty thousand men
    That for a fantasy and trick of fame
  
  Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot
    Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
   
 Which is not tomb enough and continent
    To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,
    My tho
ughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!            Exit.

Scene V.
Elsinore. A ro
om in the Castle.

Enter Horatio, Queen, and a Gentleman.

  Queen. I will not speak with her.

  Gent. She is importunate, indeed distract.
    Her mood will needs be pitied.
  Queen. What woul
d she have?
  Gent. She speaks much of her father; says she hears
    There's tricks i' th' world,
 and hems, and beats her heart;
    Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,
    That c
arry but half sense. Her speech is nothing,
    Yet the unshaped use of it doth move
    The heare
rs to collection; they aim at it,
    And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;
    Which,
 as her winks and nods and gestures yield them,
    Indeed would make one think there might be thou
ght,
    Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
  Hor. 'Twere good she were spoken with; for she
 may strew
    Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.
  Queen. Let her come in.
           
                                    [Exit Gentleman.]
    [Aside] To my sick soul (as sin's true na
ture is)
    Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
    So full of artless jealousy is guilt

    It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.

                 Enter Ophelia distracted.

  Op
h. Where is the beauteous Majesty of Denmark?
  Queen. How now, Ophelia?
  Oph. (sings)
         
How should I your true-love know
           From another one?
         By his cockle bat and' staf
f
           And his sandal shoon.

  Queen. Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
  Oph. Sa
y you? Nay, pray You mark.

    (Sings) He is dead and gone, lady,
              He is dead and g
one;
            At his head a grass-green turf,
              At his heels a stone.

    O, ho!

  Queen. Nay, but Ophelia-
  Oph. Pray you mark.

    (Sings) White his shroud as the mountain 
snow-

                    Enter King.

  Queen. Alas, look here, my lord!
  Oph. (Sings)
    
       Larded all with sweet flowers;
         Which bewept to the grave did not go
           Wit
h true-love showers.

  King. How do you, pretty lady?
  Oph. Well, God dild you! They say the ow
l was a baker's
daughter.
    Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be. God
be at

    your table!
  King. Conceit upon her father.
  Oph. Pray let's have no words of this; but when
 they ask, you
what
    it means, say you this:

    (Sings) To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,

              All in the morning bedtime,
            And I a maid at your window,
             
 To be your Valentine.

            Then up he rose and donn'd his clo'es
              And dupp'
d the chamber door,
            Let in the maid, that out a maid
              Never departed more
.

  King. Pretty Ophelia!
  Oph. Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't!

    [Sin
gs] By Gis and by Saint Charity,
              Alack, and fie for shame!
            Young men wil
l do't if they come to't
              By Cock, they are to blame.

            Quoth she, 'Befor
e you tumbled me,
              You promis'd me to wed.'

    He answers:

            'So woul
d I 'a' done, by yonder sun,
              An thou hadst not come to my bed.'

  King. How long h
ath she been thus?
  Oph. I hope all will be well. We must be patient; but I cannot
    choose but
 weep to think they would lay him i' th' cold
ground.
    My brother shall know of it; and so I th
ank you for your good
    counsel. Come, my coach! Good night, ladies. Good night,
sweet
    ladi
es. Good night, good night.                         Exit
  King. Follow her close; give her good wa
tch, I pray you.
                                                 [Exit Horatio.]

    O, this is
 the poison of deep grief; it springs
    All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
    W
hen sorrows come, they come not single spies.
    But in battalions! First, her father slain;
    
Next, your son gone, and he most violent author
    Of his own just remove; the people muddied,
  
  Thick and and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers
    For good Polonius' death, and we hav
e done but greenly
    In hugger-mugger to inter him; poor Ophelia
    Divided from herself and he
r fair judgment,
    Without the which we are pictures or mere beasts;
    Last, and as much conta
ining as all these,
    Her brother is in secret come from France;
    And wants not buzzers to in
fect his ear
    Feeds on his wonder, keep, himself in clouds,
    With pestilent speeches of his 
father's death,
    Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
    Will nothing stick our person to ar
raign
    In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
    Like to a murd'ring piece, in many places

    Give me superfluous death.                  A noise within.
  Queen. Alack, what noise is this
?
  King. Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.

                     Enter a Messenger
.

    What is the matter?
  Mess. Save Yourself, my lord:
    The ocean, overpeering of his lis
t,
    Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
    Than Young Laertes, in a riotous head,
  
  O'erbears Your offices. The rabble call him lord;
    And, as the world were now but to begin,
 
   Antiquity forgot, custom not known,
    The ratifiers and props of every word,
    They cry 'Ch
oose we! Laertes shall be king!'
    Caps, hands, and tongues applaud it to the clouds,
    'Laert
es shall be king! Laertes king!'
                                                 A noise within.

  Queen. How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!
    O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!

  King. The doors are broke.

                    Enter Laertes with others.

  Laer. Where is
 this king?- Sirs, staid you all without.
  All. No, let's come in!
  Laer. I pray you give me lea
ve.
  All. We will, we will!
  Laer. I thank you. Keep the door.      [Exeunt his Followers.]
   
 O thou vile king,
    Give me my father!
  Queen. Calmly, good Laertes.
  Laer. That drop of blo
od that's calm proclaims me bastard;
    Cries cuckold to my father; brands the harlot
    Even he
re between the chaste unsmirched brows
    Of my true mother.
  King. What is the cause, Laertes,

    That thy rebellion looks so giantlike?
    Let him go, Gertrude. Do not fear our person.
    
There's such divinity doth hedge a king
    That treason can but peep to what it would,
    Acts l
ittle of his will. Tell me, Laertes,
    Why thou art thus incens'd. Let him go, Gertrude.
    Spe
ak, man.
  Laer. Where is my father?
  King. Dead.
  Queen. But not by him!
  King. Let him dema
nd his fill.
  Laer. How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
    To hell, allegiance! vows, to
 the blackest devil
    Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
    I dare damnation. To thi
s point I stand,
    That both the world, I give to negligence,
    Let come what comes; only I'll
 be reveng'd
    Most throughly for my father.
  King. Who shall stay you?
  Laer. My will, not a
ll the world!
    And for my means, I'll husband them so well
    They shall go far with little.

  King. Good Laertes,
    If you desire to know the certainty
    Of your dear father's death, is'
t writ in your revenge
    That sweepstake you will draw both friend and foe,
    Winner and loser
?
  Laer. None but his enemies.
  King. Will you know them then?
  Laer. To his good friends thus
 wide I'll ope my arms
    And, like the kind life-rend'ring pelican,
    Repast them with my bloo
d.
  King. Why, now You speak
    Like a good child and a true gentleman.
    That I am guiltless
 of your father's death,
    And am most sensibly in grief for it,
    It shall as level to your j
udgment pierce
    As day does to your eye.
                              A noise within: 'Let her
 come in.'
  Laer. How now? What noise is that?

                      Enter Ophelia.

    O he
at, dry up my brains! Tears seven times salt
    Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!
    By
 heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight
    Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!
    
Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
    O heavens! is't possible a young maid's wits
    Should
 be as mortal as an old man's life?
    Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,
    It sends 
some precious instance of itself
    After the thing it loves.

  Oph. (sings)
         They bor
e him barefac'd on the bier
           (Hey non nony, nony, hey nony)
         And in his grave ra
in'd many a tear.

    Fare you well, my dove!
  Laer. Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade re
venge,
    It could not move thus.
  Oph. You must sing 'A-down a-down, and you call him a-down-a.
'
O,
    how the wheel becomes it! It is the false steward, that stole
his
    master's daughter
.
  Laer. This nothing's more than matter.
  Oph. There's rosemary, that's for remembrance. Pray y
ou, love,
    remember. And there is pansies, that's for thoughts.
  Laer. A document in madness! 
Thoughts and remembrance fitted.
  Oph. There's fennel for you, and columbines. There's rue for
yo
u,
    and here's some for me. We may call it herb of grace o'
Sundays.
    O, you must wear your
 rue with a difference! There's a daisy.
I
    would give you some violets, but they wither'd all 
when my
father
    died. They say he made a good end.

    [Sings] For bonny sweet Robin is all 
my joy.

  Laer. Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,
    She turns to favour and to pre
ttiness.
  Oph. (sings)
         And will he not come again?
         And will he not come again?

           No, no, he is dead;
           Go to thy deathbed;
         He never will come again.


         His beard was as white as snow,
         All flaxen was his poll.
           He is go
ne, he is gone,
           And we cast away moan.
         God 'a'mercy on his soul!

    And of
 all Christian souls, I pray God. God b' wi' you.
Exit.
  Laer. Do you see this, O God?
  King. L
aertes, I must commune with your grief,
    Or you deny me right. Go but apart,
    Make choice of
 whom your wisest friends you will,
    And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me.
    If by
 direct or by collateral hand
    They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,
    Our crown, o
ur life, and all that we call ours,
    To you in satisfaction; but if not,
    Be you content to 
lend your patience to us,
    And we shall jointly labour with your soul

  Laer. Let this be so.
    His means of death, his obscure funeral-
    No trophy, sword, nor
 hatchment o'er his bones,
    No noble rite nor formal ostentation,-
    Cry to be heard, as 'twe
re from heaven to earth,
    That I must call't in question.
  King. So you shall;
    And where

    I pray you go with me.

Scene VI.
Elsinore. Another room in the Castl
e.

Enter Horatio with an Attendant.

  Hor. What are they that would speak with me?
  Servant.
 Seafaring men, sir. They say they have letters for
you.
  Hor. Let them come in.
               
                                [Exit Attendant.]
    I do not know from what part of the world
  
  I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.

                          Enter Sailors.

  Sai
lor. God bless you, sir.
  Hor. Let him bless thee too.
  Sailor. 'A shall, sir, an't please him. 
There's a letter for
you,
    sir,- it comes from th' ambassador that was bound for
England- if

    your name be Horatio, as I am let to know it is.
  Hor. (reads the letter) 'Horatio, when thou 
shalt have
overlook'd
    this, give these fellows some means to the King. They have
    letters 
for him. Ere we were two days old at sea, a pirate of

    very warlike appointment gave us chase.
 Finding ourselves too
    slow of sail, we put on a compelled valour, and in the
grapple I
    b
oarded them. On the instant they got clear of our ship; so I
    alone became their prisoner. They 
have dealt with me like
thieves
    of mercy; but they knew what they did: I am to do a good turn

for
    them. Let the King have the letters I have sent, and repair
thou
    to me with as much 
speed as thou wouldst fly death. I have
words
    to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb; yet a
re they much
too
    light for the bore of the matter. These good fellows will
bring
    thee wh
ere I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their
course
    for England. Of them I have much to t
ell thee. Farewell.
                            'He that thou knowest thine, HAMLET.'

    Come, 
I will give you way for these your letters,
    And do't the speedier that you may direct me
    T
o him from whom you brought them.                   Exeunt.

Scene VII.
Elsinor
e. Another room in the Castle.

Enter King and Laertes.

  King. Now must your conscience my acq
uittance seal,
    And You must put me in your heart for friend,
    Sith you have heard, and with
 a knowing ear,
    That he which hath your noble father slain
    Pursued my life.
  Laer. It we
ll appears. But tell me
    Why you proceeded not against these feats
    So crimeful and so capit
al in nature,
    As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
    You mainly were stirr'd up.
  K
ing. O, for two special reasons,
    Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,
    But yet t
o me they are strong. The Queen his mother
    Lives almost by his looks; and for myself,-
    My 
virtue or my plague, be it either which,-
    She's so conjunctive to my life and soul
    That, a
s the star moves not but in his sphere,
    I could not but by her. The other motive
    Why to a 
public count I might not go
    Is the great love the general gender bear him,
    Who, dipping al
l his faults in their affection,
    Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
    Conver
t his gives to graces; so that my arrows,
    Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,
    Would 
have reverted to my bow again,
    And not where I had aim'd them.
  Laer. And so have I a noble f
ather lost;
    A sister driven into desp'rate terms,
    Whose worth, if praises may go back agai
n,
    Stood challenger on mount of all the age
    For her perfections. But my revenge will come.

  King. Break not your sleeps for that. You must not think
    That we are made of stuff so flat 
and dull
    That we can let our beard be shook with danger,
    And think it pastime. You shortly
 shall hear more.
    I lov'd your father, and we love ourself,
    And that, I hope, will teach y
ou to imagine-

                 Enter a Messenger with letters.

    How now? What news?
  Mes
s. Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:
    This to your Majesty; this to the Queen.
  King. From Hamlet
? Who brought them?
  Mess. Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not.
    They were given me by 
Claudio; he receiv'd them
    Of him that brought them.
  King. Laertes, you shall hear them.
   
 Leave us.
                                                 Exit Messenger.
    [Reads]'High and M
ighty,-You shall know I am set naked on
your
    kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see your 
kingly eyes;
    when I shall (first asking your pardon thereunto) recount the
    occasion of my 
sudden and more strange return.
                                                     'HAMLET.'
   
 What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?
    Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?
  
Laer. Know you the hand?
  King. 'Tis Hamlet's character. 'Naked!'
    And in a postscript here, h
e says 'alone.'
    Can you advise me?
  Laer. I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come!
    It
 warms the very sickness in my heart
    That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,
    'Thus di
dest thou.'
  King. If it be so, Laertes
    (As how should it be so? how otherwise?),
    Will y
ou be rul'd by me?
  Laer. Ay my lord,
    So you will not o'errule me to a peace.
  King. To thi
ne own peace. If he be now return'd
    As checking at his voyage, and that he means
    No more t
o undertake it, I will work him
    To exploit now ripe in my device,
    Under the which he shall
 not choose but fall;
    And for his death no wind shall breathe
    But even his mother shall un
charge the practice
    And call it accident.
  Laer. My lord, I will be rul'd;
    The rather, i
f you could devise it so
    That I might be the organ.
  King. It falls right.
    You have been
 talk'd of since your travel much,
    And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality
    Wherein the
y say you shine, Your sum of parts
    Did not together pluck such envy from him
    As did that o
ne; and that, in my regard,
    Of the unworthiest siege.
  Laer. What part is that, my lord?
  K
ing. A very riband in the cap of youth-
    Yet needfull too; for youth no less becomes
    The li
ght and careless livery that it wears
    Than settled age his sables and his weeds,
    Importing
 health and graveness. Two months since
    Here was a gentleman of Normandy.
    I have seen myse
lf, and serv'd against, the French,
    And they can well on horseback; but this gallant
    Had w
itchcraft in't. He grew unto his seat,
    And to such wondrous doing brought his horse
    As had
 he been incorps'd and demi-natur'd
    With the brave beast. So far he topp'd my thought
    That
 I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
    Come short of what he did.
  Laer. A Norman was't?
  Kin
g. A Norman.
  Laer. Upon my life, Lamound.
  King. The very same.
  Laer. I know him well. He is
 the broach indeed
    And gem of all the nation.
  King. He made confession of you;
    And gave
 you such a masterly report
    For art and exercise in your defence,
    And for your rapier most
 especially,
    That he cried out 'twould be a sight indeed
    If one could match you. The scrim
ers of their nation
    He swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
    If you oppos'd them. Sir,
 this report of his
    Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
    That he could nothing do but wish 
and beg
    Your sudden coming o'er to play with you.
    Now, out of this-
  Laer. What out of t
his, my lord?
  King. Laertes, was your father dear to you?
    Or are you like the painting of a 
sorrow,
    A face without a heart,'
  Laer. Why ask you this?
  King. Not that I think you did n
ot love your father;
    But that I know love is begun by time,
    And that I see, in passages of
 proof,
    Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
    There lives within the very flame of love

    A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
    And nothing is at a like goodness still;
   
 For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
    Dies in his own too-much. That we would do,
    We should
 do when we would; for this 'would' changes,
    And hath abatements and delays as many
    As the
re are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
    And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
 
   That hurts by easing. But to the quick o' th' ulcer!
    Hamlet comes back. What would you under
take
    To show yourself your father's son in deed
    More than in words?
  Laer. To cut his th
roat i' th' church!
  King. No place indeed should murther sanctuarize;
    Revenge should have no
 bounds. But, good Laertes,
    Will you do this? Keep close within your chamber.
    Hamlet retur
n'd shall know you are come home.
    We'll put on those shall praise your excellence
    And set 
a double varnish on the fame
    The Frenchman gave you; bring you in fine together
    And wager 
on your heads. He, being remiss,
    Most generous, and free from all contriving,
    Will not per
use the foils; so that with ease,
    Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
    A sword unbat
ed, and, in a pass of practice,
    Requite him for your father.
  Laer. I will do't!
    And for
 that purpose I'll anoint my sword.
    I bought an unction of a mountebank,
    So mortal that, b
ut dip a knife in it,
    Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
    Collected from all simple
s that have virtue
    Under the moon, can save the thing from death
    This is but scratch'd wit
hal. I'll touch my point
    With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
    It may be deat
h.
  King. Let's further think of this,
    Weigh what convenience both of time and means
    May
 fit us to our shape. If this should fall,
    And that our drift look through our bad performance.

    'Twere better not assay'd. Therefore this project
    Should have a back or second, that migh
t hold
    If this did blast in proof. Soft! let me see.
    We'll make a solemn wager on your cun
nings-
    I ha't!
    When in your motion you are hot and dry-
    As make your bouts more viole
nt to that end-
    And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepar'd him
    A chalice for the nonc
e; whereon but sipping,
    If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
    Our purpose may hold th
ere.- But stay, what noise,

                           Enter Queen.

    How now, sweet queen?

  Queen. One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
    So fast they follow. Your sister's drown'd, L
aertes.
  Laer. Drown'd! O, where?
  Queen. There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
    That show
s his hoar leaves in the glassy stream.
    There with fantastic garlands did she come
    Of crow
flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,
    That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
    B
ut our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them.
    There on the pendant boughs her coronet weed
s
    Clamb'ring to hang, an envious sliver broke,
    When down her weedy trophies and herself
 
   Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide
    And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her u
p;
    Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes,
    As one incapable of her own distress,
 
   Or like a creature native and indued
    Unto that element; but long it could not be
    Till t
hat her garments, heavy with their drink,
    Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay
    To
 muddy death.
  Laer. Alas, then she is drown'd?
  Queen. Drown'd, drown'd.
  Laer. Too much of w
ater hast thou, poor Ophelia,
    And therefore I forbid my tears; but yet
    It is our trick; na
ture her custom holds,
    Let shame say what it will. When these are gone,
    The woman will be 
out. Adieu, my lord.
    I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze
    But that this folly do
uts it.                          Exit.
  King. Let's follow, Gertrude.
    How much I had to do to
 calm his rage I
    Now fear I this will give it start again;
    Therefore let's follow.
      
                                                   Exeunt.

ACT V. Scene I.
Els
inore. A churchyard.

Enter two Clowns, [with spades and pickaxes].

  Clown. Is she to be burie
d in Christian burial when she
wilfully
    seeks her own salvation?
  Other. I tell thee she is;
 therefore make her grave straight.
    The crowner hath sate on her, and finds it Christian burial
.
  Clown. How can that be, unless she drown'd herself in her own
    defence?
  Other. Why, 'tis
 found so.
  Clown. It must be se offendendo; it cannot be else. For here
lies
    the point: if 
I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act; and
an
    act hath three branches-it is to act, to do
, and to perform;
    argal, she drown'd herself wittingly.
  Other. Nay, but hear you, Goodman De
lver!
  Clown. Give me leave. Here lies the water; good. Here stands
the
    man; good. If the ma
n go to this water and drown himself, it
is,
    will he nill he, he goes- mark you that. But if t
he water
come to
    him and drown him, he drowns not himself. Argal, he that is
not
    guilty 
of his own death shortens not his own life.
  Other. But is this law?
  Clown. Ay, marry, is't- cr
owner's quest law.
  Other. Will you ha' the truth an't? If this had not been a
    gentlewoman, s
he should have been buried out o' Christian
burial.
  Clown. Why, there thou say'st! And the more 
pity that great
folk
    should have count'nance in this world to drown or hang
themselves
    m
ore than their even-Christian. Come, my spade! There is no
    ancient gentlemen but gard'ners, dit
chers, and grave-makers.
They
    hold up Adam's profession.
  Other. Was he a gentleman?
  Clow
n. 'A was the first that ever bore arms.
  Other. Why, he had none.
  Clown. What, art a heathen? 
How dost thou understand the
Scripture?
    The Scripture says Adam digg'd. Could he dig without a
rms?
I'll
    put another question to thee. If thou answerest me not to the
    purpose, confess 
thyself-
  Other. Go to!
  Clown. What is he that builds stronger than either the mason,
the
   
 shipwright, or the carpenter?
  Other. The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand
    
tenants.
  Clown. I like thy wit well, in good faith. The gallows does
well.
    But how does it 
well? It does well to those that do ill. Now,
    thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronge
r than the
    church. Argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To't again,
come!
  Other. Who bui
lds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a
    carpenter?
  Clown. Ay, tell me that, and unyoke
.
  Other. Marry, now I can tell!
  Clown. To't.
  Other. Mass, I cannot tell.

               
  Enter Hamlet and Horatio afar off.

  Clown. Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull a
ss
will
    not mend his pace with beating; and when you are ask'd this
    question next, say 'a
 grave-maker.' The houses he makes lasts
    till doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan; fetch me a sto
up of
    liquor.
                                            [Exit Second Clown.]


          
             [Clown digs and] sings.

       In youth when I did love, did love,
         Methoug
ht it was very sweet;
       To contract- O- the time for- a- my behove,
         O, methought the
re- a- was nothing- a- meet.

  Ham. Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings
at

    grave-making?
  Hor. Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.
  Ham. 'Tis e'en so.
 The hand of little employment hath the
daintier
    sense.
  Clown. (sings)
         But age wi
th his stealing steps
           Hath clawed me in his clutch,
         And hath shipped me intil 
the land,
           As if I had never been such.
                                            [Thr
ows up a skull.]

  Ham. That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once. How
the
    knave j
owls it to the ground,as if 'twere Cain's jawbone,
that
    did the first murther! This might be t
he pate of a
Politician,
    which this ass now o'erreaches; one that would circumvent
God,
    
might it not?
  Hor. It might, my lord.
  Ham. Or of a courtier, which could say 'Good morrow, swe
et
lord!
    How dost thou, good lord?' This might be my Lord Such-a-one,
that
    prais'd my Lo
rd Such-a-one's horse when he meant to beg it-
might
    it not?
  Hor. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Why,
 e'en so! and now my Lady Worm's, chapless, and
knock'd
    about the mazzard with a sexton's spad
e. Here's fine
revolution,
    and we had the trick to see't. Did these bones cost no more
the
 
   breeding but to play at loggets with 'em? Mine ache to think
    on't.
  Clown. (Sings)
      
   A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,
           For and a shrouding sheet;
         O, a Pit of clay
 for to be made
           For such a guest is meet.
                                      Throws 
up [another skull].

  Ham. There's another. Why may not that be the skull of a
lawyer?
    Wher
e be his quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, his
tenures,
    and his tricks? Why does he suffe
r this rude knave now to
knock
    him about the sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell
hi
m
    of his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be in's time
a
    great buyer of land, wi
th his statutes, his recognizances,
his
    fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries. Is this th
e fine
of
    his fines, and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his
fine
    pate full of f
ine dirt? Will his vouchers vouch him no more
of
    his purchases, and double ones too, than the 
length and
breadth
    of a pair of indentures? The very conveyances of his lands
will
    scarc
ely lie in this box; and must th' inheritor himself have
no
    more, ha?
  Hor. Not a jot more, 
my lord.
  Ham. Is not parchment made of sheepskins?
  Hor. Ay, my lord, And of calveskins too.
 
 Ham. They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in
that. I
    will speak to this fellow.
 Whose grave's this, sirrah?
  Clown. Mine, sir.

    [Sings] O, a pit of clay for to be made
  
            For such a guest is meet.

  Ham. I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in't.
  
Clown. You lie out on't, sir, and therefore 'tis not yours.
    For my part, I do not lie in't, yet
 it is mine.
  Ham. Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine. 'Tis
for
    the dead, no
t for the quick; therefore thou liest.
  Clown. 'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away again from me to
 you.
  Ham. What man dost thou dig it for?
  Clown. For no man, sir.
  Ham. What woman then?
  
Clown. For none neither.
  Ham. Who is to be buried in't?
  Clown. One that was a woman, sir; but,
 rest her soul, she's
dead.
  Ham. How absolute the knave is! We must speak by the card, or
    e
quivocation will undo us. By the Lord, Horatio, this three
years
    I have taken note of it, the 
age is grown so picked that the
toe
    of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he

galls
    his kibe.- How long hast thou been a grave-maker?
  Clown. Of all the days i' th' year, 
I came to't that day that
our
    last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.
  Ham. How long is that s
ince?
  Clown. Cannot you tell that? Every fool can tell that. It was
the
    very day that young
 Hamlet was born- he that is mad, and sent
    into England.
  Ham. Ay, marry, why was be sent int
o England?
  Clown. Why, because 'a was mad. 'A shall recover his wits
there;
    or, if 'a do no
t, 'tis no great matter there.
  Ham. Why?
  Clown. 'Twill not he seen in him there. There the men
 are as
mad as
    he.
  Ham. How came he mad?
  Clown. Very strangely, they say.
  Ham. How st
rangely?
  Clown. Faith, e'en with losing his wits.
  Ham. Upon what ground?
  Clown. Why, here i
n Denmark. I have been sexton here, man and
boy
    thirty years.
  Ham. How long will a man lie 
i' th' earth ere he rot?
  Clown. Faith, if 'a be not rotten before 'a die (as we have
many
    p
ocky corses now-a-days that will scarce hold the laying in,
I
    will last you some eight year or
 nine year. A tanner will
last
    you nine year.
  Ham. Why he more than another?
  Clown. Why,
 sir, his hide is so tann'd with his trade that 'a
will
    keep out water a great while; and your
 water is a sore
decayer of
    your whoreson dead body. Here's a skull now. This skull hath
lien

    you i' th' earth three-and-twenty years.
  Ham. Whose was it?
  Clown. A whoreson, mad fello
w's it was. Whose do you think it
was?
  Ham. Nay, I know not.
  Clown. A pestilence on him for a
 mad rogue! 'A pour'd a flagon
of
    Rhenish on my head once. This same skull, sir, was Yorick's

    skull, the King's jester.
  Ham. This?
  Clown. E'en that.
  Ham. Let me see. [Takes the sku
ll.] Alas, poor Yorick! I knew
him,
    Horatio. A fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fanc
y.
He
    hath borne me on his back a thousand times. And now how
abhorred
    in my imagination
 it is! My gorge rises at it. Here hung
those
    lips that I have kiss'd I know not how oft. Wher
e be your
gibes
    now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment that
    were wont t
o set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock
your
    own grinning? Quite chap- fall'n? Now get
 you to my lady's
    chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this
    favour she m
ust come. Make her laugh at that. Prithee,
Horatio,
    tell me one thing.
  Hor. What's that, my
 lord?
  Ham. Dost thou think Alexander look'd o' this fashion i' th'
earth?
  Hor. E'en so.
  H
am. And smelt so? Pah!
                                          [Puts down the skull.]
  Hor. E'e
n so, my lord.
  Ham. To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not
    imagination trace 
the noble dust of Alexander till he find it
    stopping a bunghole?
  Hor. 'Twere to consider too
 curiously, to consider so.
  Ham. No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with
modesty
 
   enough, and likelihood to lead it; as thus: Alexander died,
    Alexander was buried, Alexander 
returneth into dust; the dust
is
    earth; of earth we make loam; and why of that loam (whereto

he
    was converted) might they not stop a beer barrel?
    Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to 
clay,
    Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.
    O, that that earth which kept the world in 
awe
    Should patch a wall t' expel the winter's flaw!
    But soft! but soft! aside! Here comes 
the King-

    Enter [priests with] a coffin [in funeral procession], King,
             Queen, L
aertes, with Lords attendant.]

    The Queen, the courtiers. Who is this they follow?
    And wi
th such maimed rites? This doth betoken
    The corse they follow did with desp'rate hand
    Ford
o it own life. 'Twas of some estate.
    Couch we awhile, and mark.
                              
           [Retires with Horatio.]

  Laer. What ceremony else?
  Ham. That is Laertes,
    A ve
ry noble youth. Mark.
  Laer. What ceremony else?
  Priest. Her obsequies have been as far enlarg'
d
    As we have warranty. Her death was doubtful;
    And, but that great command o'ersways the o
rder,
    She should in ground unsanctified have lodg'd
    Till the last trumpet. For charitable 
prayers,
    Shards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on her.
    Yet here she is allow'd her 
virgin rites,
    Her maiden strewments, and the bringing home
    Of bell and burial.
  Laer. Mu
st there no more be done?
  Priest. No more be done.
    We should profane the service of the dead

    To sing a requiem and such rest to her
    As to peace-parted souls.
  Laer. Lay her i' th' 
earth;
    And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
    May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish pr
iest,
    A minist'ring angel shall my sister be
    When thou liest howling.
  Ham. What, the fa
ir Ophelia?
  Queen. Sweets to the sweet! Farewell.
                                             [
Scatters flowers.]
    I hop'd thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
    I thought thy bride-b
ed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
    And not have strew'd thy grave.
  Laer. O, treble woe
    Fall
 ten times treble on that cursed head
    Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
    Depriv'd 
thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,
    Till I have caught her once more in mine arms.
           
                                  Leaps in the grave.
    Now pile your dust upon the quick and dea
d
    Till of this flat a mountain you have made
    T' o'ertop old Pelion or the skyish head
   
 Of blue Olympus.
  Ham. [comes forward] What is he whose grief
    Bears such an emphasis? whose 
phrase of sorrow
    Conjures the wand'ring stars, and makes them stand
    Like wonder-wounded he
arers? This is I,
    Hamlet the Dane.                    [Leaps in after Laertes.
  Laer. The dev
il take thy soul!
                                            [Grapples with him].
  Ham. Thou pra
y'st not well.
    I prithee take thy fingers from my throat;
    For, though I am not splenitive 
and rash,
    Yet have I in me something dangerous,
    Which let thy wisdom fear. Hold off thy ha
nd!
  King. Pluck them asunder.
  Queen. Hamlet, Hamlet!
  All. Gentlemen!
  Hor. Good my lord, 
be quiet.
             [The Attendants part them, and they come out of the
                       
                                  grave.]
  Ham. Why, I will fight with him upon this theme
    Un
til my eyelids will no longer wag.
  Queen. O my son, what theme?
  Ham. I lov'd Ophelia. Forty th
ousand brothers
    Could not (with all their quantity of love)
    Make up my sum. What wilt thou
 do for her?
  King. O, he is mad, Laertes.
  Queen. For love of God, forbear him!
  Ham. 'Swound
s, show me what thou't do.
    Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?
    Woo't 
drink up esill? eat a crocodile?
    I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?
    To outface me wi
th leaping in her grave?
    Be buried quick with her, and so will I.
    And if thou prate of mou
ntains, let them throw
    Millions of acres on us, till our ground,
    Singeing his pate against
 the burning zone,
    Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
    I'll rant as well as thou
.
  Queen. This is mere madness;
    And thus a while the fit will work on him.
    Anon, as pati
ent as the female dove
    When that her golden couplets are disclos'd,
    His silence will sit d
rooping.
  Ham. Hear you, sir!
    What is the reason that you use me thus?
    I lov'd you ever.
 But it is no matter.
    Let Hercules himself do what he may,
    The cat will mew, and dog will 
have his day.
Exit.
  King. I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.
                           
                        Exit Horatio.
    [To Laertes] Strengthen your patience in our last night's

speech.
    We'll put the matter to the present push.-
    Good Gertrude, set some watch over yo
ur son.-
    This grave shall have a living monument.
    An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;

    Till then in patience our proceeding be.
                                                      
   Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A hall in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet and Horatio.

  Ham
. So much for this, sir; now shall you see the other.
    You do remember all the circumstance?
  
Hor. Remember it, my lord!
  Ham. Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting
    That would not
 let me sleep. Methought I lay
    Worse than the mutinies in the bilboes. Rashly-
    And prais'd
 be rashness for it; let us know,
    Our indiscretion sometime serves us well
    When our deep p
lots do pall; and that should learn us
    There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
    Rough-hew 
them how we will-
  Hor. That is most certain.
  Ham. Up from my cabin,
    My sea-gown scarf'd a
bout me, in the dark
    Grop'd I to find out them; had my desire,
    Finger'd their packet, and 
in fine withdrew
    To mine own room again; making so bold
    (My fears forgetting manners) to u
nseal
    Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio
    (O royal knavery!), an exact command,

    Larded with many several sorts of reasons,
    Importing Denmark's health, and England's too,

    With, hoo! such bugs and goblins in my life-
    That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
 
   No, not to stay the finding of the axe,
    My head should be struck off.
  Hor. Is't possible?

  Ham. Here's the commission; read it at more leisure.
    But wilt thou bear me how I did procee
d?
  Hor. I beseech you.
  Ham. Being thus benetted round with villanies,
    Or I could make a p
rologue to my brains,
    They had begun the play. I sat me down;
    Devis'd a new commission; wr
ote it fair.
    I once did hold it, as our statists do,
    A baseness to write fair, and labour'
d much
    How to forget that learning; but, sir, now
    It did me yeoman's service. Wilt thou kn
ow
    Th' effect of what I wrote?
  Hor. Ay, good my lord.
  Ham. An earnest conjuration from th
e King,
    As England was his faithful tributary,
    As love between them like the palm might fl
ourish,
    As peace should still her wheaten garland wear
    And stand a comma 'tween their amit
ies,
    And many such-like as's of great charge,
    That, on the view and knowing of these conte
nts,
    Without debatement further, more or less,
    He should the bearers put to sudden death,

    Not shriving time allow'd.
  Hor. How was this seal'd?
  Ham. Why, even in that was heaven or
dinant.
    I had my father's signet in my purse,
    Which was the model of that Danish seal;
  
  Folded the writ up in the form of th' other,
    Subscrib'd it, gave't th' impression, plac'd it 
safely,
    The changeling never known. Now, the next day
    Was our sea-fight; and what to this 
was sequent
    Thou know'st already.
  Hor. So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.
  Ham. Why,
 man, they did make love to this employment!
    They are not near my conscience; their defeat
   
 Does by their own insinuation grow.
    'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
    Between th
e pass and fell incensed points
    Of mighty opposites.
  Hor. Why, what a king is this!
  Ham. 
Does it not, thinks't thee, stand me now upon-
    He that hath kill'd my king, and whor'd my mothe
r;
    Popp'd in between th' election and my hopes;
    Thrown out his angle for my proper life,

    And with such coz'nage- is't not perfect conscience
    To quit him with this arm? And is't not
 to be damn'd
    To let this canker of our nature come
    In further evil?
  Hor. It must be sh
ortly known to him from England
    What is the issue of the business there.
  Ham. It will be sho
rt; the interim is mine,
    And a man's life is no more than to say 'one.'
    But I am very sorr
y, good Horatio,
    That to Laertes I forgot myself,
    For by the image of my cause I see
    
The portraiture of his. I'll court his favours.
    But sure the bravery of his grief did put me
 
   Into a tow'ring passion.
  Hor. Peace! Who comes here?

                 Enter young Osric, a 
courtier.

  Osr. Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
  Ham. I humbly thank you, sir.
 [Aside to Horatio] Dost know this
    waterfly?
  Hor. [aside to Hamlet] No, my good lord.
  Ham
. [aside to Horatio] Thy state is the more gracious; for
'tis a
    vice to know him. He hath much
 land, and fertile. Let a beast
be
    lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at the king's mess
.
'Tis
    a chough; but, as I say, spacious in the possession of dirt.

  Osr. Sweet lord, if y
our lordship were at leisure, I should
impart
    a thing to you from his Majesty.
  Ham. I will 
receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit. Put
your
    bonnet to his right use. 'Tis for the 
head.
  Osr. I thank your lordship, it is very hot.
  Ham. No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the win
d is northerly.
  Osr. It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
  Ham. But yet methinks it is very
 sultry and hot for my
complexion.
  Osr. Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry, as 'twere- I
c
annot
    tell how. But, my lord, his Majesty bade me signify to you
that
    he has laid a great
 wager on your head. Sir, this is the
matter-
  Ham. I beseech you remember.
                    
       [Hamlet moves him to put on his hat.]
  Osr. Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith
. Sir, here
is
    newly come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute
gentleman,
    full of m
ost excellent differences, of very soft society and
    great showing. Indeed, to speak feelingly o
f him, he is the
card
    or calendar of gentry; for you shall find in him the
continent of
    
what part a gentleman would see.
  Ham. Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you; though, I


    know, to divide him inventorially would dozy th' arithmetic
of
    memory, and yet but yaw 
neither in respect of his quick sail.
    But, in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul 
of
great
    article, and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as, to
make
    true diction 
of him, his semblable is his mirror, and who
else
    would trace him, his umbrage, nothing more.

  Osr. Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
  Ham. The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap th
e gentleman in our
more
    rawer breath?
  Osr. Sir?
  Hor [aside to Hamlet] Is't not possible 
to understand in
another
    tongue? You will do't, sir, really.
  Ham. What imports the nominati
on of this gentleman?
  Osr. Of Laertes?
  Hor. [aside] His purse is empty already. All's golden w
ords are
    spent.
  Ham. Of him, sir.
  Osr. I know you are not ignorant-
  Ham. I would you d
id, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would
not
    much approve me. Well, sir?
  Osr. You are n
ot ignorant of what excellence Laertes is-
  Ham. I dare not confess that, lest I should compare wi
th him in
    excellence; but to know a man well were to know himself.
  Osr. I mean, sir, for his
 weapon; but in the imputation laid on
him
    by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.
  Ham. What'
s his weapon?
  Osr. Rapier and dagger.
  Ham. That's two of his weapons- but well.
  Osr. The Ki
ng, sir, hath wager'd with him six Barbary horses;
    against the which he has impon'd, as I take 
it, six French
    rapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers,
and
    so. Thre
e of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy,
    very responsive to the hilts, most delica
te carriages, and of
    very liberal conceit.
  Ham. What call you the carriages?
  Hor. [aside 
to Hamlet] I knew you must be edified by the
margent
    ere you had done.
  Osr. The carriages, 
sir, are the hangers.
  Ham. The phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could
    carry 
cannon by our sides. I would it might be hangers till
then.
    But on! Six Barbary horses against
 six French swords, their
    assigns, and three liberal-conceited carriages: that's the
French
 
   bet against the Danish. Why is this all impon'd, as you call
it?
  Osr. The King, sir, hath lai
d that, in a dozen passes between
    yourself and him, he shall not exceed you three hits; he hath

    laid on twelve for nine, and it would come to immediate trial
    if your lordship would vouc
hsafe the answer.
  Ham. How if I answer no?
  Osr. I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person
 in trial.
  Ham. Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please his
Majesty,
    it is the brea
thing time of day with me. Let the foils be
    brought, the gentleman willing, and the King hold h
is
purpose,
    I will win for him if I can; if not, I will gain nothing but
my
    shame and th
e odd hits.
  Osr. Shall I redeliver you e'en so?
  Ham. To this effect, sir, after what flourish 
your nature will.
  Osr. I commend my duty to your lordship.
  Ham. Yours, yours. [Exit Osric.] He
 does well to commend it
    himself; there are no tongues else for's turn.
  Hor. This lapwing ru
ns away with the shell on his head.
  Ham. He did comply with his dug before he suck'd it. Thus has

he,
    and many more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age
dotes
    on, only got the tu
ne of the time and outward habit of
encounter-
    a kind of yesty collection, which carries them 
through and
    through the most fann'd and winnowed opinions; and do but
blow
    them to their 
trial-the bubbles are out,

                            Enter a Lord.

  Lord. My lord, his Maje
sty commended him to you by young Osric,
who
    brings back to him, that you attend him in the ha
ll. He sends
to
    know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you
will
    take l
onger time.
  Ham. I am constant to my purposes; they follow the King's
pleasure.
    If his fitn
ess speaks, mine is ready; now or whensoever,
provided
    I be so able as now.
  Lord. The King 
and Queen and all are coming down.
  Ham. In happy time.
  Lord. The Queen desires you to use some
 gentle entertainment to
    Laertes before you fall to play.
  Ham. She well instructs me.
     
                                               [Exit Lord.]
  Hor. You will lose this wager, my lor
d.
  Ham. I do not think so. Since he went into France I have been
in
    continual practice. I s
hall win at the odds. But thou wouldst
not
    think how ill all's here about my heart. But it is 
no matter.
  Hor. Nay, good my lord -
  Ham. It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gaingivin
g as
    would perhaps trouble a woman.
  Hor. If your mind dislike anything, obey it. I will fore
stall
their
    repair hither and say you are not fit.
  Ham. Not a whit, we defy augury; there's
 a special providence
in
    the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not to come; if it
be
   
 not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will
come:
    the readiness is all. Since 
no man knows aught of what he
leaves,
    what is't to leave betimes? Let be.

    Enter King, Q
ueen, Laertes, Osric, and Lords, with other
              Attendants with foils and gauntlets.
   
            A table and flagons of wine on it.

  King. Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand fro
m me.
                    [The King puts Laertes' hand into Hamlet's.]
  Ham. Give me your pardon,
 sir. I have done you wrong;
    But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.
    This presence knows,
 
   And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd
    With sore distraction. What I have done
  
  That might your nature, honour, and exception
    Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
  
  Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet.
    If Hamlet from himself be taken away,
    And wh
en he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
    Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
    Who doe
s it, then? His madness. If't be so,
    Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
    His madness
 is poor Hamlet's enemy.
    Sir, in this audience,
    Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd evil
 
   Free me so far in your most generous thoughts
    That I have shot my arrow o'er the house
    
And hurt my brother.
  Laer. I am satisfied in nature,
    Whose motive in this case should stir m
e most
    To my revenge. But in my terms of honour
    I stand aloof, and will no reconcilement

    Till by some elder masters of known honour
    I have a voice and precedent of peace
    To ke
ep my name ungor'd. But till that time
    I do receive your offer'd love like love,
    And will 
not wrong it.
  Ham. I embrace it freely,
    And will this brother's wager frankly play.
    Giv
e us the foils. Come on.
  Laer. Come, one for me.
  Ham. I'll be your foil, Laertes. In mine igno
rance
    Your skill shall, like a star i' th' darkest night,
    Stick fiery off indeed.
  Laer.
 You mock me, sir.
  Ham. No, by this hand.
  King. Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamle
t,
    You know the wager?
  Ham. Very well, my lord.
    Your Grace has laid the odds o' th' wea
ker side.
  King. I do not fear it, I have seen you both;
    But since he is better'd, we have th
erefore odds.
  Laer. This is too heavy; let me see another.
  Ham. This likes me well. These foil
s have all a length?
                                                Prepare to play.
  Osr. Ay, m
y good lord.
  King. Set me the stoups of wine upon that table.
    If Hamlet give the first or se
cond hit,
    Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
    Let all the battlements their ordnance 
fire;
    The King shall drink to Hamlet's better breath,
    And in the cup an union shall he thr
ow
    Richer than that which four successive kings
    In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the 
cups;
    And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
    The trumpet to the cannoneer without,
    
The cannons to the heavens, the heaven to earth,
    'Now the King drinks to Hamlet.' Come, begin.

    And you the judges, bear a wary eye.
  Ham. Come on, sir.
  Laer. Come, my lord.             
                   They play.
  Ham. One.
  Laer. No.
  Ham. Judgment!
  Osr. A hit, a very palp
able hit.
  Laer. Well, again!
  King. Stay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
    Here
's to thy health.
               [Drum; trumpets sound; a piece goes off [within].
    Give him th
e cup.
  Ham. I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile.
    Come. (They play.) Another hit. Wha
t say you?
  Laer. A touch, a touch; I do confess't.
  King. Our son shall win.
  Queen. He's fat
, and scant of breath.
    Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows.
    The Queen carouses to 
thy fortune, Hamlet.
  Ham. Good madam!
  King. Gertrude, do not drink.
  Queen. I will, my lord;
 I pray you pardon me.          Drinks.
  King. [aside] It is the poison'd cup; it is too late.
  
Ham. I dare not drink yet, madam; by-and-by.
  Queen. Come, let me wipe thy face.
  Laer. My lord,
 I'll hit him now.
  King. I do not think't.
  Laer. [aside] And yet it is almost against my consc
ience.
  Ham. Come for the third, Laertes! You but dally.
    Pray you pass with your best violenc
e;
    I am afeard you make a wanton of me.
  Laer. Say you so? Come on.                          
     Play.
  Osr. Nothing neither way.
  Laer. Have at you now!
                [Laertes wounds H
amlet; then] in scuffling, they
                    change rapiers, [and Hamlet wounds Laertes].
 
 King. Part them! They are incens'd.
  Ham. Nay come! again!                         The Queen fall
s.

  Osr. Look to the Queen there, ho!
  Hor. They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?
  O
sr. How is't, Laertes?
  Laer. Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric.
    I am justly kill
'd with mine own treachery.
  Ham. How does the Queen?
  King. She sounds to see them bleed.
  Qu
een. No, no! the drink, the drink! O my dear Hamlet!
    The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.      
           [Dies.]
  Ham. O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd.
    Treachery! Seek it out.
    
                                            [Laertes falls.]
  Laer. It is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, th
ou art slain;
    No medicine in the world can do thee good.
    In thee there is not half an hour
 of life.
    The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
    Unbated and envenom'd. The foul pract
ice
    Hath turn'd itself on me. Lo, here I lie,
    Never to rise again. Thy mother's poison'd.

    I can no more. The King, the King's to blame.
  Ham. The point envenom'd too?
    Then, venom
, to thy work.                    Hurts the King.
  All. Treason! treason!
  King. O, yet defend m
e, friends! I am but hurt.
  Ham. Here, thou incestuous, murd'rous, damned Dane,
    Drink off thi
s potion! Is thy union here?
    Follow my mother.                                 King dies.
  La
er. He is justly serv'd.
    It is a poison temper'd by himself.
    Exchange forgiveness with me,
 noble Hamlet.
    Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
    Nor thine on me!            
                           Dies.
  Ham. Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.
    I am dead,
 Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!
    You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
    That are b
ut mutes or audience to this act,
    Had I but time (as this fell sergeant, Death,
    Is strict 
in his arrest) O, I could tell you-
    But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;
    Thou liv'st; report
 me and my cause aright
    To the unsatisfied.
  Hor. Never believe it.
    I am more an antique
 Roman than a Dane.
    Here's yet some liquor left.
  Ham. As th'art a man,
    Give me the cup.
 Let go! By heaven, I'll ha't.
    O good Horatio, what a wounded name
    (Things standing thus u
nknown) shall live behind me!
    If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,
    Absent thee from fe
licity awhile,
    And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
    To tell my story.         
[March afar off, and shot within.]
    What warlike noise is this?
  Osr. Young Fortinbras, with c
onquest come from Poland,
    To the ambassadors of England gives
    This warlike volley.
  Ham.
 O, I die, Horatio!
    The potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit.
    I cannot live to hear the
 news from England,
    But I do prophesy th' election lights
    On Fortinbras. He has my dying v
oice.
    So tell him, with th' occurrents, more and less,
    Which have solicited- the rest is s
ilence.             Dies.
  Hor. Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince,
    And fligh
ts of angels sing thee to thy rest!
                                                 [March within.
]
    Why does the drum come hither?

    Enter Fortinbras and English Ambassadors, with Drum,
 
                 Colours, and Attendants.

  Fort. Where is this sight?
  Hor. What is it you wil
l see?
    If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
  Fort. This quarry cries on havoc. O pro
ud Death,
    What feast is toward in thine eternal cell
    That thou so many princes at a shot

    So bloodily hast struck.
  Ambassador. The sight is dismal;
    And our affairs from England c
ome too late.
    The ears are senseless that should give us hearing
    To tell him his commandme
nt is fulfill'd
    That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.
    Where should we have our thank
s?
  Hor. Not from his mouth,
    Had it th' ability of life to thank you.
    He never gave comm
andment for their death.
    But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
    You from the Polack
 wars, and you from England,
    Are here arriv'd, give order that these bodies
    High on a stag
e be placed to the view;
    And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
    How these things came
 about. So shall you hear
    Of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts;
    Of accidental judgments, c
asual slaughters;
    Of deaths put on by cunning and forc'd cause;
    And, in this upshot, purpo
ses mistook
    Fall'n on th' inventors' heads. All this can I
    Truly deliver.
  Fort. Let us 
haste to hear it,
    And call the noblest to the audience.
    For me, with sorrow I embrace my f
ortune.
    I have some rights of memory in this kingdom
    Which now, to claim my vantage doth i
nvite me.
  Hor. Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
    And from his mouth whose voice will
 draw on more.
    But let this same be presently perform'd,
    Even while men's minds are wild, 
lest more mischance
    On plots and errors happen.
  Fort. Let four captains
    Bear Hamlet lik
e a soldier to the stage;
    For he was likely, had he been put on,
    To have prov'd most royal
ly; and for his passage
    The soldiers' music and the rites of war
    Speak loudly for him.
  
  Take up the bodies. Such a sight as this
    Becomes the field but here shows much amiss.
    Go
, bid the soldiers shoot.
            Exeunt marching; after the which a peal of ordnance
        
                                           are shot off.

ACT I. Scene I.
Elsinore. A platform before the Castle.

Enter two Sentinels-[first
,] Francisco, [who paces up and down
at his post; then] Bernardo, [who approaches him].

  Ber. W
ho's there?
  Fran. Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.
  Ber. Long live the King!
  Fran.
 Bernardo?
  Ber. He.
  Fran. You come most carefully upon your hour.
  Ber. 'Tis now struck twel
ve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.
  Fran. For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold,
    And I a
m sick at heart.
  Ber. Have you had quiet guard?
  Fran. Not a mouse stirring.
  Ber. Well, good
 night.
    If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
    The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.


                    Enter Horatio and Marcellus.

  Fran. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who 
is there?
  Hor. Friends to this ground.
  Mar. And liegemen to the Dane.
  Fran. Give you good n
ight.
  Mar. O, farewell, honest soldier.
    Who hath reliev'd you?
  Fran. Bernardo hath my pla
ce.
    Give you good night.                                   Exit.
  Mar. Holla, Bernardo!
  Be
r. Say-
    What, is Horatio there ?
  Hor. A piece of him.
  Ber. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, goo
d Marcellus.
  Mar. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
  Ber. I have seen nothing.
  M
ar. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
    And will not let belief take hold of him
    Touching t
his dreaded sight, twice seen of us.
    Therefore I have entreated him along,
    With us to watc
h the minutes of this night,
    That, if again this apparition come,
    He may approve our eyes 
and speak to it.
  Hor. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
  Ber. Sit down awhile,
    And let us onc
e again assail your ears,
    That are so fortified against our story,
    What we two nights have
 seen.
  Hor. Well, sit we down,
    And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
  Ber. Last night of
 all,
    When yond same star that's westward from the pole
    Had made his course t' illume that
 part of heaven
    Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
    The bell then beating one-

  
                      Enter Ghost.

  Mar. Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!
  Be
r. In the same figure, like the King that's dead.
  Mar. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.

  Ber. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.
  Hor. Most like. It harrows me with fear and
 wonder.
  Ber. It would be spoke to.
  Mar. Question it, Horatio.
  Hor. What art thou that usur
p'st this time of night
    Together with that fair and warlike form
    In which the majesty of b
uried Denmark
    Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!
  Mar. It is offended.
  Be
r. See, it stalks away!
  Hor. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!
                          
                           Exit Ghost.
  Mar. 'Tis gone and will not answer.
  Ber. How now, Horat
io? You tremble and look pale.
    Is not this something more than fantasy?
    What think you on'
t?
  Hor. Before my God, I might not this believe
    Without the sensible and true avouch
    Of
 mine own eyes.
  Mar. Is it not like the King?
  Hor. As thou art to thyself.
    Such was the v
ery armour he had on
    When he th' ambitious Norway combated.
    So frown'd he once when, in an
 angry parle,
    He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
    'Tis strange.
  Mar. Thus twice be
fore, and jump at this dead hour,
    With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
  Hor. In what
 particular thought to work I know not;
    But, in the gross and scope of my opinion,
    This bo
des some strange eruption to our state.
  Mar. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows,
    
Why this same strict and most observant watch
    So nightly toils the subject of the land,
    An
d why such daily cast of brazen cannon
    And foreign mart for implements of war;
    Why such im
press of shipwrights, whose sore task
    Does not divide the Sunday from the week.
    What might
 be toward, that this sweaty haste
    Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day?
    Who is
't that can inform me?
  Hor. That can I.
    At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
    W
hose image even but now appear'd to us,
    Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
    Thereto
 prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
    Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet
    (For
 so this side of our known world esteem'd him)
    Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compa
ct,
    Well ratified by law and heraldry,
    Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
  
  Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror;
    Against the which a moiety competent
    Was gag
ed by our king; which had return'd
    To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
    Had he been vanquishe
r, as, by the same cov'nant
    And carriage of the article design'd,
    His fell to Hamlet. Now,
 sir, young Fortinbras,
    Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
    Hath in the skirts of Norway, h
ere and there,
    Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
    For food and diet, to some enterpri
se
    That hath a stomach in't; which is no other,
    As it doth well appear unto our state,
  
  But to recover of us, by strong hand
    And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
    So by 
his father lost; and this, I take it,
    Is the main motive of our preparations,
    The source o
f this our watch, and the chief head
    Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
  Ber. I think
 it be no other but e'en so.
    Well may it sort that this portentous figure
    Comes armed thro
ugh our watch, so like the King
    That was and is the question of these wars.
  Hor. A mote it i
s to trouble the mind's eye.
    In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
    A little ere the mi
ghtiest Julius fell,
    The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead
    Did squeak and gibb
er in the Roman streets;
    As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood,
    Disasters in the
 sun; and the moist star
    Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
    Was sick almost to d
oomsday with eclipse.
    And even the like precurse of fierce events,
    As harbingers preceding
 still the fates
    And prologue to the omen coming on,
    Have heaven and earth together demons
trated
    Unto our climature and countrymen.

                      Enter Ghost again.

    Bu
t soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again!
    I'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!
 
                                              Spreads his arms.
    If thou hast any sound, or use 
of voice,
    Speak to me.
    If there be any good thing to be done,
    That may to thee do eas
e, and, race to me,
    Speak to me.
    If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
    Which happi
ly foreknowing may avoid,
    O, speak!
    Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
    Extorted tr
easure in the womb of earth
    (For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death),
            
                                     The cock crows.
    Speak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Ma
rcellus!
  Mar. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
  Hor. Do, if it will not stand.
  Ber. 'T
is here!
  Hor. 'Tis here!
  Mar. 'Tis gone!
                                                    
 Exit Ghost.
    We do it wrong, being so majestical,
    To offer it the show of violence;
    F
or it is as the air, invulnerable,
    And our vain blows malicious mockery.
  Ber. It was about t
o speak, when the cock crew.
  Hor. And then it started, like a guilty thing
    Upon a fearful su
mmons. I have heard
    The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
    Doth with his lofty and shr
ill-sounding throat
    Awake the god of day; and at his warning,
    Whether in sea or fire, in e
arth or air,
    Th' extravagant and erring spirit hies
    To his confine; and of the truth herei
n
    This present object made probation.
  Mar. It faded on the crowing of the cock.
    Some sa
y that ever, 'gainst that season comes
    Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
    The bird
 of dawning singeth all night long;
    And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,
    The ni
ghts are wholesome, then no planets strike,
    No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
   
 So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
  Hor. So have I heard and do in part believe it.
    Bu
t look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
    Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.
    Bre
ak we our watch up; and by my advice
    Let us impart what we have seen to-night
    Unto young H
amlet; for, upon my life,
    This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
    Do you consent we sh
all acquaint him with it,
    As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
    Let's do't, I pray; a
nd I this morning know
    Where we shall find him most conveniently.           Exeunt.




Sc
ene II.
Elsinore. A room of state in the Castle.

Flourish. [Enter Claudius, King of Denmark, Ger
trude the Queen,
Hamlet,
Polonius, Laertes and his sister Ophelia, [Voltemand, Cornelius,]
Lords 
Attendant.

  King. Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
    The memory be green, and th
at it us befitted
    To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom
    To be contracted in o
ne brow of woe,
    Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
    That we with wisest sorrow t
hink on him
    Together with remembrance of ourselves.
    Therefore our sometime sister, now our
 queen,
    Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,
    Have we, as 'twere with a defeated j
oy,
    With an auspicious, and a dropping eye,
    With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marri
age,
    In equal scale weighing delight and dole,
    Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd
 
   Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
    With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
  
  Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
    Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
    Or t
hinking by our late dear brother's death
    Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
    Collea
gued with this dream of his advantage,
    He hath not fail'd to pester us with message
    Import
ing the surrender of those lands
    Lost by his father, with all bands of law,
    To our most va
liant brother. So much for him.
    Now for ourself and for this time of meeting.
    Thus much th
e business is: we have here writ
    To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,
    Who, impotent and b
edrid, scarcely hears
    Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress
    His further gait herein, i
n that the levies,
    The lists, and full proportions are all made
    Out of his subject; and we
 here dispatch
    You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,
    For bearers of this greeting to ol
d Norway,
    Giving to you no further personal power
    To business with the King, more than the
 scope
    Of these dilated articles allow.            [Gives a paper.]
    Farewell, and let your
 haste commend your duty.
  Cor., Volt. In that, and all things, will we show our duty.
  King. We
 doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell.
                                 Exeunt Voltemand and Corneli
us.
    And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
    You told us of some suit. What is't, Laert
es?
    You cannot speak of reason to the Dane
    And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Lae
rtes,
    That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
    The head is not more native to the heart
,
    The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
    Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
 
   What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
  Laer. My dread lord,
    Your leave and favour to return to 
France;
    From whence though willingly I came to Denmark
    To show my duty in your coronation,

    Yet now I must confess, that duty done,
    My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France

    And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
  King. Have you your father's leave? What says
 Polonius?
  Pol. He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
    By laboursome petition, and at
 last
    Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent.
    I do beseech you give him leave to go.
  Ki
ng. Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,
    And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
    
But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son-
  Ham. [aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind!

  King. How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
  Ham. Not so, my lord. I am too much i' th' s
un.
  Queen. Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
    And let thine eye look like a friend on
 Denmark.
    Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
    Seek for thy noble father in the dust.
   
 Thou know'st 'tis common. All that lives must die,
    Passing through nature to eternity.
  Ham.
 Ay, madam, it is common.
  Queen. If it be,
    Why seems it so particular with thee?
  Ham. See
ms, madam, Nay, it is. I know not 'seems.'
    'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
    Nor 
customary suits of solemn black,
    Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,
    No, nor the fruit
ful river in the eye,
    Nor the dejected havior of the visage,
    Together with all forms, mood
s, shapes of grief,
    'That can denote me truly. These indeed seem,
    For they are actions tha
t a man might play;
    But I have that within which passeth show-
    These but the trappings and
 the suits of woe.
  King. 'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
    To give these mo
urning duties to your father;
    But you must know, your father lost a father;
    That father lo
st, lost his, and the survivor bound
    In filial obligation for some term
    To do obsequious s
orrow. But to persever
    In obstinate condolement is a course
    Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis 
unmanly grief;
    It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
    A heart unfortified, a mind impat
ient,
    An understanding simple and unschool'd;
    For what we know must be, and is as common

    As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
    Why should we in our peevish opposition
    Take it
 to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
    A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
    To re
ason most absurd, whose common theme
    Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
    From t
he first corse till he that died to-day,
    'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth
    Thi
s unprevailing woe, and think of us
    As of a father; for let the world take note
    You are th
e most immediate to our throne,
    And with no less nobility of love
    Than that which dearest 
father bears his son
    Do I impart toward you. For your intent
    In going back to school in Wi
ttenberg,
    It is most retrograde to our desire;
    And we beseech you, bend you to remain
   
 Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
    Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
  Queen
. Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.
    I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.

  Ham. I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
  King. Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.
    B
e as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come.
    This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet
    Sits smili
ng to my heart; in grace whereof,
    No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day
    But the grea
t cannon to the clouds shall tell,
    And the King's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,
    Resp
eaking earthly thunder. Come away.
                                Flourish. Exeunt all but Hamlet.

  Ham. O that this too too solid flesh would melt,
    Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!
    
Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
    His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
    How we
ary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
    Seem to me all the uses of this world!
    Fie on't! ah, fi
e! 'Tis an unweeded garden
    That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
    Possess it 
merely. That it should come to this!
    But two months dead! Nay, not so much, not two.
    So ex
cellent a king, that was to this
    Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
    That he might
 not beteem the winds of heaven
    Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
    Must I remem
ber? Why, she would hang on him
    As if increase of appetite had grown
    By what it fed on; an
d yet, within a month-
    Let me not think on't! Frailty, thy name is woman!-
    A little month,
 or ere those shoes were old
    With which she followed my poor father's body
    Like Niobe, all
 tears- why she, even she
    (O God! a beast that wants discourse of reason
    Would have mourn'
d longer) married with my uncle;
    My father's brother, but no more like my father
    Than I to
 Hercules. Within a month,
    Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
    Had left the flushin
g in her galled eyes,
    She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
    With such dexterity to in
cestuous sheets!
    It is not, nor it cannot come to good.
    But break my heart, for I must hol
d my tongue!

          Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo.

  Hor. Hail to your lordship!

  Ham. I am glad to see you well.
    Horatio!- or I do forget myself.
  Hor. The same, my lord, a
nd your poor servant ever.
  Ham. Sir, my good friend- I'll change that name with you.
    And wha
t make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?
    Marcellus?
  Mar. My good lord!
  Ham. I am very glad to
 see you.- [To Bernardo] Good even, sir.-

    But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
  Ho
r. A truant disposition, good my lord.
  Ham. I would not hear your enemy say so,
    Nor shall yo
u do my ear that violence
    To make it truster of your own report
    Against yourself. I know y
ou are no truant.
    But what is your affair in Elsinore?
    We'll teach you to drink deep ere y
ou depart.
  Hor. My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
  Ham. I prithee do not mock me, f
ellow student.
    I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
  Hor. Indeed, my lord, it followed 
hard upon.
  Ham. Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats
    Did coldly furnish forth th
e marriage tables.
    Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
    Or ever I had seen that day, H
oratio!
    My father- methinks I see my father.
  Hor. O, where, my lord?
  Ham. In my mind's ey
e, Horatio.
  Hor. I saw him once. He was a goodly king.
  Ham. He was a man, take him for all in 
all.
    I shall not look upon his like again.
  Hor. My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
  H
am. Saw? who?
  Hor. My lord, the King your father.
  Ham. The King my father?
  Hor. Season your
 admiration for a while
    With an attent ear, till I may deliver
    Upon the witness of these g
entlemen,
    This marvel to you.
  Ham. For God's love let me hear!
  Hor. Two nights together h
ad these gentlemen
    (Marcellus and Bernardo) on their watch
    In the dead vast and middle of 
the night
    Been thus encount'red. A figure like your father,
    Armed at point exactly, cap-a-
pe,
    Appears before them and with solemn march
    Goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he wal
k'd
    By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
    Within his truncheon's length; whilst they
 distill'd
    Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
    Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to 
me
    In dreadful secrecy impart they did,
    And I with them the third night kept the watch;
 
   Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
    Form of the thing, each word made true and good,

    The apparition comes. I knew your father.
    These hands are not more like.
  Ham. But wher
e was this?
  Mar. My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
  Ham. Did you not speak to it?
 
 Hor. My lord, I did;
    But answer made it none. Yet once methought
    It lifted up it head and
 did address
    Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
    But even then the morning cock crew
 loud,
    And at the sound it shrunk in haste away
    And vanish'd from our sight.
  Ham. 'Tis 
very strange.
  Hor. As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
    And we did think it writ down 
in our duty
    To let you know of it.
  Ham. Indeed, indeed, sirs. But this troubles me.
    Hol
d you the watch to-night?
  Both [Mar. and Ber.] We do, my lord.
  Ham. Arm'd, say you?
  Both. A
rm'd, my lord.
  Ham. From top to toe?
  Both. My lord, from head to foot.
  Ham. Then saw you no
t his face?
  Hor. O, yes, my lord! He wore his beaver up.
  Ham. What, look'd he frowningly.
  H
or. A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
  Ham. Pale or red?
  Hor. Nay, very pale.
  Ham.
 And fix'd his eyes upon you?
  Hor. Most constantly.
  Ham. I would I had been there.
  Hor. It 
would have much amaz'd you.
  Ham. Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
  Hor. While one with mod
erate haste might tell a hundred.
  Both. Longer, longer.
  Hor. Not when I saw't.
  Ham. His bea
rd was grizzled- no?
  Hor. It was, as I have seen it in his life,
    A sable silver'd.
  Ham. I
 will watch to-night.
    Perchance 'twill walk again.
  Hor. I warr'nt it will.
  Ham. If it ass
ume my noble father's person,
    I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
    And bid me 
hold my peace. I pray you all,
    If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
    Let it be tenabl
e in your silence still;
    And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
    Give it an understanding 
but no tongue.
    I will requite your loves. So, fare you well.
    Upon the platform, 'twixt ele
ven and twelve,
    I'll visit you.
  All. Our duty to your honour.
  Ham. Your loves, as mine to
 you. Farewell.
                                        Exeunt [all but Hamlet].
    My father's s
pirit- in arms? All is not well.
    I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come!
    Till t
hen sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,
    Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eye
s.
Exit.




Scene III.
Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius.

Enter Laertes and Ophel
ia.

  Laer. My necessaries are embark'd. Farewell.
    And, sister, as the winds give benefit
 
   And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
    But let me hear from you.
  Oph. Do you doubt that?

  Laer. For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,
    Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood;
  
  A violet in the youth of primy nature,
    Forward, not permanent- sweet, not lasting;
    The p
erfume and suppliance of a minute;
    No more.
  Oph. No more but so?
  Laer. Think it no more.

    For nature crescent does not grow alone
    In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,
    
The inward service of the mind and soul
    Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
    And n
ow no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
    The virtue of his will; but you must fear,
    His greatne
ss weigh'd, his will is not his own;
    For he himself is subject to his birth.
    He may not, a
s unvalued persons do,
    Carve for himself, for on his choice depends
    The safety and health 
of this whole state,
    And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd
    Unto the voice and yie
lding of that body
    Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
    It fits your wisd
om so far to believe it
    As he in his particular act and place
    May give his saying deed; wh
ich is no further
    Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
    Then weigh what loss your ho
nour may sustain
    If with too credent ear you list his songs,
    Or lose your heart, or your c
haste treasure open
    To his unmast'red importunity.
    Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sist
er,
    And keep you in the rear of your affection,
    Out of the shot and danger of desire.
   
 The chariest maid is prodigal enough
    If she unmask her beauty to the moon.
    Virtue itself 
scopes not calumnious strokes.
    The canker galls the infants of the spring
    Too oft before t
heir buttons be disclos'd,
    And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
    Contagious blastments a
re most imminent.
    Be wary then; best safety lies in fear.
    Youth to itself rebels, though n
one else near.
  Oph. I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep
    As watchman to my heart. But
, good my brother,
    Do not as some ungracious pastors do,
    Show me the steep and thorny way 
to heaven,
    Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
    Himself the primrose path of dall
iance treads
    And recks not his own rede.
  Laer. O, fear me not!

                       Ent
er Polonius.

    I stay too long. But here my father comes.
    A double blessing is a double gr
ace;
    Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
  Pol. Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame!

    The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
    And you are stay'd for. There- my blessing wi
th thee!
    And these few precepts in thy memory
    Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no to
ngue,
    Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.
    Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar:
 
   Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
    Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of 
steel;
    But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
    Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade.
 Beware
    Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,
    Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee
.
    Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice;
    Take each man's censure, but reserve thy ju
dgment.
    Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
    But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy
;
    For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
    And they in France of the best rank and station

    Are most select and generous, chief in that.
    Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
    For l
oan oft loses both itself and friend,
    And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
    This abov
e all- to thine own self be true,
    And it must follow, as the night the day,
    Thou canst not
 then be false to any man.
    Farewell. My blessing season this in thee!
  Laer. Most humbly do I
 take my leave, my lord.
  Pol. The time invites you. Go, your servants tend.
  Laer. Farewell, Op
helia, and remember well
    What I have said to you.
  Oph. 'Tis in my memory lock'd,
    And yo
u yourself shall keep the key of it.
  Laer. Farewell.                                          Exi
t.
  Pol. What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?
  Oph. So please you, something touching the Lo
rd Hamlet.
  Pol. Marry, well bethought!
    'Tis told me he hath very oft of late
    Given priv
ate time to you, and you yourself
    Have of your audience been most free and bounteous.
    If i
t be so- as so 'tis put on me,
    And that in way of caution- I must tell you
    You do not unde
rstand yourself so clearly
    As it behooves my daughter and your honour.
    What is between you
? Give me up the truth.
  Oph. He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
    Of his affection to
 me.
  Pol. Affection? Pooh! You speak like a green girl,
    Unsifted in such perilous circumstan
ce.
    Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
  Oph. I do not know, my lord, what I should
 think,
  Pol. Marry, I will teach you! Think yourself a baby
    That you have ta'en these tender
s for true pay,
    Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,
    Or (not to crack the 
wind of the poor phrase,
    Running it thus) you'll tender me a fool.
  Oph. My lord, he hath imp
ortun'd me with love
    In honourable fashion.
  Pol. Ay, fashion you may call it. Go to, go to!

  Oph. And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
    With almost all the holy vows of hea
ven.
  Pol. Ay, springes to catch woodcocks! I do know,
    When the blood burns, how prodigal the
 soul
    Lends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter,
    Giving more light than heat, extinct 
in both
    Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
    You must not take for fire. From this ti
me
    Be something scanter of your maiden presence.
    Set your entreatments at a higher rate
 
   Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
    Believe so much in him, that he is young,
    An
d with a larger tether may he walk
    Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia,
    Do not believe 
his vows; for they are brokers,
    Not of that dye which their investments show,
    But mere imp
lorators of unholy suits,
    Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
    The better to beguile
. This is for all:
    I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth
    Have you so slander a
ny moment leisure
    As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
    Look to't, I charge you. 
Come your ways.
  Oph. I shall obey, my lord.
                                                    
     Exeunt.




Scene IV.
Elsinore. The platform before the Castle.

Enter Hamlet, Horatio,
 and Marcellus.

  Ham. The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
  Hor. It is a nipping and an ea
ger air.
  Ham. What hour now?
  Hor. I think it lacks of twelve.
  Mar. No, it is struck.
  Hor
. Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws near the season
    Wherein the spirit held his wont to wal
k.
                   A flourish of trumpets, and two pieces go off.
    What does this mean, my l
ord?
  Ham. The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
    Keeps wassail, and the swagg'ring
 upspring reels,
    And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
    The kettledrum and trumpe
t thus bray out
    The triumph of his pledge.
  Hor. Is it a custom?
  Ham. Ay, marry, is't;
  
  But to my mind, though I am native here
    And to the manner born, it is a custom
    More hono
ur'd in the breach than the observance.
    This heavy-headed revel east and west
    Makes us tra
duc'd and tax'd of other nations;
    They clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase
    Soil our 
addition; and indeed it takes
    From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
    The pith 
and marrow of our attribute.
    So oft it chances in particular men
    That, for some vicious mo
le of nature in them,
    As in their birth,- wherein they are not guilty,
    Since nature cannot
 choose his origin,-
    By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
    Oft breaking down the pales and
 forts of reason,
    Or by some habit that too much o'erleavens
    The form of plausive manners,
 that these men
    Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
    Being nature's livery, or fortun
e's star,
    Their virtues else- be they as pure as grace,
    As infinite as man may undergo-
 
   Shall in the general censure take corruption
    From that particular fault. The dram of e'il
 
   Doth all the noble substance often dout To his own scandal.

                         Enter Gho
st.

  Hor. Look, my lord, it comes!
  Ham. Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
    Be thou
 a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
    Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
  
  Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
    Thou com'st in such a questionable shape
    That I wil
l speak to thee. I'll call thee Hamlet,
    King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me?
    Let me not
 burst in ignorance, but tell
    Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,
    Have burst their 
cerements; why the sepulchre
    Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
    Hath op'd his ponderous 
and marble jaws
    To cast thee up again. What may this mean
    That thou, dead corse, again in 
complete steel,
    Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
    Making night hideous, and we fools
 of nature
    So horridly to shake our disposition
    With thoughts beyond the reaches of our so
uls?
    Say, why is this? wherefore? What should we do?
                                         
  Ghost beckons Hamlet.
  Hor. It beckons you to go away with it,
    As if it some impartment did
 desire
    To you alone.
  Mar. Look with what courteous action
    It waves you to a more remov
ed ground.
    But do not go with it!
  Hor. No, by no means!
  Ham. It will not speak. Then will
 I follow it.
  Hor. Do not, my lord!
  Ham. Why, what should be the fear?
    I do not set my li
fe at a pin's fee;
    And for my soul, what can it do to that,
    Being a thing immortal as itse
lf?
    It waves me forth again. I'll follow it.
  Hor. What if it tempt you toward the flood, my 
lord,
    Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
    That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
   
 And there assume some other, horrible form
    Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
   
 And draw you into madness? Think of it.
    The very place puts toys of desperation,
    Without 
more motive, into every brain
    That looks so many fadoms to the sea
    And hears it roar benea
th.
  Ham. It waves me still.
    Go on. I'll follow thee.
  Mar. You shall not go, my lord.
  H
am. Hold off your hands!
  Hor. Be rul'd. You shall not go.
  Ham. My fate cries out
    And make
s each petty artire in this body
    As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
                        
                        [Ghost beckons.]

    Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
    By hea
ven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!-
    I say, away!- Go on. I'll follow thee.
          
                              Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet.
  Hor. He waxes desperate with imagination.

  Mar. Let's follow. 'Tis not fit thus to obey him.
  Hor. Have after. To what issue will this com
e?
  Mar. Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
  Hor. Heaven will direct it.
  Mar. Nay, 
let's follow him.
                                                         Exeunt.




Scene V
.
Elsinore. The Castle. Another part of the fortifications.

Enter Ghost and Hamlet.

  Ham. Wh
ither wilt thou lead me? Speak! I'll go no further.
  Ghost. Mark me.
  Ham. I will.
  Ghost. My 
hour is almost come,
    When I to sulph'rous and tormenting flames
    Must render up myself.
  
Ham. Alas, poor ghost!
  Ghost. Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
    To what I shall unfo
ld.
  Ham. Speak. I am bound to hear.
  Ghost. So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
  Ha
m. What?
  Ghost. I am thy father's spirit,
    Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
    
And for the day confin'd to fast in fires,
    Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
    
Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid
    To tell the secrets of my prison house,
    I 
could a tale unfold whose lightest word
    Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
    
Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
    Thy knotted and combined locks to part
,
    And each particular hair to stand on end
    Like quills upon the fretful porcupine.
    Bu
t this eternal blazon must not be
    To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
    If thou
 didst ever thy dear father love-
  Ham. O God!
  Ghost. Revenge his foul and most unnatural murth
er.
  Ham. Murther?
  Ghost. Murther most foul, as in the best it is;
    But this most foul, str
ange, and unnatural.
  Ham. Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
    As meditation or t
he thoughts of love,
    May sweep to my revenge.
  Ghost. I find thee apt;
    And duller should
st thou be than the fat weed
    That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
    Wouldst thou not sti
r in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.
    'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
    A serpent stung
 me. So the whole ear of Denmark
    Is by a forged process of my death
    Rankly abus'd. But kno
w, thou noble youth,
    The serpent that did sting thy father's life
    Now wears his crown.
  
Ham. O my prophetic soul!
    My uncle?
  Ghost. Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
    
With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts-
    O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power

    So to seduce!- won to his shameful lust
    The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.
    O
 Hamlet, what a falling-off was there,
    From me, whose love was of that dignity
    That it wen
t hand in hand even with the vow
    I made to her in marriage, and to decline
    Upon a wretch w
hose natural gifts were poor
    To those of mine!
    But virtue, as it never will be mov'd,
   
 Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
    So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
   
 Will sate itself in a celestial bed
    And prey on garbage.
    But soft! methinks I scent the m
orning air.
    Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
    My custom always of the afternoon
,
    Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
    With juice of cursed hebona in a vial,
    And in 
the porches of my ears did pour
    The leperous distilment; whose effect
    Holds such an enmity
 with blood of man
    That swift as quicksilver it courses through
    The natural gates and alle
ys of the body,
    And with a sudden vigour it doth posset
    And curd, like eager droppings int
o milk,
    The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine;
    And a most instant tetter bark'd abo
ut,
    Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust
    All my smooth body.
    Thus was I, sl
eeping, by a brother's hand
    Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd;
    Cut off even 
in the blossoms of my sin,
    Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd,
    No reckoning made, but sent
 to my account
    With all my imperfections on my head.
  Ham. O, horrible! O, horrible! most hor
rible!
  Ghost. If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.
    Let not the royal bed of Denmark be

    A couch for luxury and damned incest.
    But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
    Taint no
t thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
    Against thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven,
    And t
o those thorns that in her bosom lodge
    To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once.
    The
 glowworm shows the matin to be near
    And gins to pale his uneffectual fire.
    Adieu, adieu, 
adieu! Remember me.                      Exit.

  Ham. O all you host of heaven! O earth! What els
e?
    And shall I couple hell? Hold, hold, my heart!
    And you, my sinews, grow not instant old
,
    But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?
    Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
 
   In this distracted globe. Remember thee?
    Yea, from the table of my memory
    I'll wipe awa
y all trivial fond records,
    All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past
    That youth an
d observation copied there,
    And thy commandment all alone shall live
    Within the book and v
olume of my brain,
    Unmix'd with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!
    O most pernicious woman!
  
  O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
    My tables! Meet it is I set it down
    That on
e may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
    At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark.        [W
rites.]
    So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word:
    It is 'Adieu, adieu! Remember me.'
    
I have sworn't.
  Hor. (within) My lord, my lord!

                   Enter Horatio and Marcellus
.

  Mar. Lord Hamlet!
  Hor. Heaven secure him!
  Ham. So be it!
  Mar. Illo, ho, ho, my lord!

  Ham. Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.
  Mar. How is't, my noble lord?
  Hor. What news, m
y lord?
  Mar. O, wonderful!
  Hor. Good my lord, tell it.
  Ham. No, you will reveal it.
  Hor.
 Not I, my lord, by heaven!
  Mar. Nor I, my lord.
  Ham. How say you then? Would heart of man onc
e think it?
    But you'll be secret?
  Both. Ay, by heaven, my lord.
  Ham. There's neer a villa
in dwelling in all Denmark
    But he's an arrant knave.
  Hor. There needs no ghost, my lord, com
e from the grave
    To tell us this.
  Ham. Why, right! You are in the right!
    And so, withou
t more circumstance at all,
    I hold it fit that we shake hands and part;
    You, as your busin
ess and desires shall point you,
    For every man hath business and desire,
    Such as it is; an
d for my own poor part,
    Look you, I'll go pray.
  Hor. These are but wild and whirling words, 
my lord.
  Ham. I am sorry they offend you, heartily;
    Yes, faith, heartily.
  Hor. There's no
 offence, my lord.
  Ham. Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
    And much offence too. 
Touching this vision here,
    It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.
    For your desire to
 know what is between us,
    O'ermaster't as you may. And now, good friends,
    As you are frien
ds, scholars, and soldiers,
    Give me one poor request.
  Hor. What is't, my lord? We will.
  H
am. Never make known what you have seen to-night.
  Both. My lord, we will not.
  Ham. Nay, but sw
ear't.
  Hor. In faith,
    My lord, not I.
  Mar. Nor I, my lord- in faith.
  Ham. Upon my swor
d.
  Mar. We have sworn, my lord, already.
  Ham. Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.

              
   Ghost cries under the stage.

  Ghost. Swear.
  Ham. Aha boy, say'st thou so? Art thou there, 
truepenny?
    Come on! You hear this fellow in the cellarage.
    Consent to swear.
  Hor. Propo
se the oath, my lord.
  Ham. Never to speak of this that you have seen.
    Swear by my sword.
  
Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
  Ham. Hic et ubique? Then we'll shift our ground.
    Come hither, gentle
men,
    And lay your hands again upon my sword.
    Never to speak of this that you have heard:

    Swear by my sword.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear by his sword.
  Ham. Well said, old mole! Canst wo
rk i' th' earth so fast?
    A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends."
  Hor. O day and ni
ght, but this is wondrous strange!
  Ham. And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
    There a
re more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
    Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
    But co
me!
    Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
    How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself
  
  (As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
    To put an antic disposition on),
    That you, at
 such times seeing me, never shall,
    With arms encumb'red thus, or this head-shake,
    Or by p
ronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
    As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'
 
   Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'
    Or such ambiguous giving out, to 
note
    That you know aught of me- this is not to do,
    So grace and mercy at your most need he
lp you,
    Swear.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
                                                   [
They swear.]
  Ham. Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! So, gentlemen,
    With all my love I do commend
 me to you;
    And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
    May do t' express his love and friending t
o you,
    God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;
    And still your fingers on your 
lips, I pray.
    The time is out of joint. O cursed spite
    That ever I was born to set it righ
t!
    Nay, come, let's go together.
                                                         Exeu

Act II. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius.

Enter Polon
ius and Reynaldo.

  Pol. Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
  Rey. I will, my lord.

  Pol. You shall do marvell's wisely, good Reynaldo,
    Before You visit him, to make inquire
  
  Of his behaviour.
  Rey. My lord, I did intend it.
  Pol. Marry, well said, very well said. Look
 you, sir,
    Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
    And how, and who, what means, and 
where they keep,
    What company, at what expense; and finding
    By this encompassment and drif
t of question
    That they do know my son, come you more nearer
    Than your particular demands 
will touch it.
    Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
    As thus, 'I know his fa
ther and his friends,
    And in part him.' Do you mark this, Reynaldo?
  Rey. Ay, very well, my l
ord.
  Pol. 'And in part him, but,' you may say, 'not well.
    But if't be he I mean, he's very w
ild
    Addicted so and so'; and there put on him
    What forgeries you please; marry, none so ra
nk
    As may dishonour him- take heed of that;
    But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips

    As are companions noted and most known
    To youth and liberty.
  Rey. As gaming, my lord.
 
 Pol. Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
    Drabbing. You may go so far.
  Rey. My 
lord, that would dishonour him.
  Pol. Faith, no, as you may season it in the charge.
    You must
 not put another scandal on him,
    That he is open to incontinency.
    That's not my meaning. B
ut breathe his faults so quaintly
    That they may seem the taints of liberty,
    The flash and 
outbreak of a fiery mind,
    A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
    Of general assault.
  Rey. B
ut, my good lord-
  Pol. Wherefore should you do this?
  Rey. Ay, my lord,
    I would know that.

  Pol. Marry, sir, here's my drift,
    And I believe it is a fetch of warrant.
    You laying t
hese slight sullies on my son
    As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' th' working,
    Mark you,

    Your party in converse, him you would sound,
    Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
 
   The youth you breathe of guilty, be assur'd
    He closes with you in this consequence:
    'Go
od sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman'-
    According to the phrase or the addition
    Of ma
n and country-
  Rey. Very good, my lord.
  Pol. And then, sir, does 'a this- 'a does- What was I 
about to
say?
    By the mass, I was about to say something! Where did I leave?
  Rey. At 'closes
 in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,' and
    gentleman.'
  Pol. At 'closes in the consequence'
- Ay, marry!
    He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman.
    I saw him yesterday, or t'other day,

    Or then, or then, with such or such; and, as you say,
    There was 'a gaming; there o'ertook i
n's rouse;
    There falling out at tennis'; or perchance,
    'I saw him enter such a house of sa
le,'
    Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
    See you now-
    Your bait of falsehood takes thi
s carp of truth;
    And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
    With windlasses and with assays of
 bias,
    By indirections find directions out.
    So, by my former lecture and advice,
    Shal
l you my son. You have me, have you not?
  Rey. My lord, I have.
  Pol. God b' wi' ye, fare ye wel
l!
  Rey. Good my lord!                                    [Going.]
  Pol. Observe his inclination
 in yourself.
  Rey. I shall, my lord.
  Pol. And let him ply his music.
  Rey. Well, my lord.
 
 Pol. Farewell!
                                                  Exit Reynaldo.

               
        Enter Ophelia.

    How now, Ophelia? What's the matter?
  Oph. O my lord, my lord, I hav
e been so affrighted!
  Pol. With what, i' th' name of God?
  Oph. My lord, as I was sewing in my 
closet,
    Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac'd,
    No hat upon his head, his stockings fo
ul'd,
    Ungart'red, and down-gyved to his ankle;
    Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each 
other,
    And with a look so piteous in purport
    As if he had been loosed out of hell
    To 
speak of horrors- he comes before me.
  Pol. Mad for thy love?
  Oph. My lord, I do not know,
   
 But truly I do fear it.
  Pol. What said he?
  Oph. He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
  
  Then goes he to the length of all his arm,
    And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
    
He falls to such perusal of my face
    As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so.
    At last, a lit
tle shaking of mine arm,
    And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
    He rais'd a sigh so 
piteous and profound
    As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
    And end his being. That done, 
he lets me go,
    And with his head over his shoulder turn'd
    He seem'd to find his way withou
t his eyes,
    For out o' doors he went without their help
    And to the last bended their light
 on me.
  Pol. Come, go with me. I will go seek the King.
    This is the very ecstasy of love,
 
   Whose violent property fordoes itself
    And leads the will to desperate undertakings
    As o
ft as any passion under heaven
    That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
    What, have you g
iven him any hard words of late?
  Oph. No, my good lord; but, as you did command,
    I did repel
 his letters and denied
    His access to me.
  Pol. That hath made him mad.
    I am sorry that 
with better heed and judgment
    I had not quoted him. I fear'd he did but trifle
    And meant t
o wrack thee; but beshrew my jealousy!
    By heaven, it is as proper to our age
    To cast beyon
d ourselves in our opinions
    As it is common for the younger sort
    To lack discretion. Come,
 go we to the King.
    This must be known; which, being kept close, might move
    More grief to 
hide than hate to utter love.
    Come.
                                                         E
xeunt.

Scene II.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Flourish. [Enter King and Queen, Rosencrantz
 and Guildenstern,
cum aliis.

  King. Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
    Moreover 
that we much did long to see you,
    The need we have to use you did provoke
    Our hasty sendin
g. Something have you heard
    Of Hamlet's transformation. So I call it,
    Sith nor th' exterio
r nor the inward man
    Resembles that it was. What it should be,
    More than his father's deat
h, that thus hath put him
    So much from th' understanding of himself,
    I cannot dream of. I 
entreat you both
    That, being of so young days brought up with him,
    And since so neighbour'
d to his youth and haviour,
    That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
    Some little tim
e; so by your companies
    To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather
    So much as from occasio
n you may glean,
    Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus
    That, open'd, lies within o
ur remedy.
  Queen. Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,
    And sure I am two men there ar
e not living
    To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
    To show us so much gentry and 
good will
    As to expend your time with us awhile
    For the supply and profit of our hope,
  
  Your visitation shall receive such thanks
    As fits a king's remembrance.
  Ros. Both your Maj
esties
    Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
    Put your dread pleasures more into co
mmand
    Than to entreaty.
  Guil. But we both obey,
    And here give up ourselves, in the full
 bent,
    To lay our service freely at your feet,
    To be commanded.
  King. Thanks, Rosencran
tz and gentle Guildenstern.
  Queen. Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz.
    And I beseec
h you instantly to visit
    My too much changed son.- Go, some of you,
    And bring these gentle
men where Hamlet is.
  Guil. Heavens make our presence and our practices
    Pleasant and helpful 
to him!
  Queen. Ay, amen!
                 Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, [with some
     
                                               Attendants].

                         Enter Poloni
us.

  Pol. Th' ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
    Are joyfully return'd.
  King. Thou s
till hast been the father of good news.
  Pol. Have I, my lord? Assure you, my good liege,
    I h
old my duty as I hold my soul,
    Both to my God and to my gracious king;
    And I do think- or 
else this brain of mine
    Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
    As it hath us'd to do- that 
I have found
    The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
  King. O, speak of that! That do I long to he
ar.
  Pol. Give first admittance to th' ambassadors.
    My news shall be the fruit to that great 
feast.
  King. Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
                                      
          [Exit Polonius.]
    He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found
    The head and sourc
e of all your son's distemper.
  Queen. I doubt it is no other but the main,
    His father's deat
h and our o'erhasty marriage.
  King. Well, we shall sift him.

              Enter Polonius, Vol
temand, and Cornelius.

    Welcome, my good friends.
    Say, Voltemand, what from our brother N
orway?
  Volt. Most fair return of greetings and desires.
    Upon our first, he sent out to suppr
ess
    His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
    To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack,
  
  But better look'd into, he truly found
    It was against your Highness; whereat griev'd,
    Th
at so his sickness, age, and impotence
    Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
    On For
tinbras; which he, in brief, obeys,
    Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,
    Makes vow b
efore his uncle never more
    To give th' assay of arms against your Majesty.
    Whereon old Nor
way, overcome with joy,
    Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee
    And his commission t
o employ those soldiers,
    So levied as before, against the Polack;
    With an entreaty, herein
 further shown,
                                                [Gives a paper.]
    That it might
 please you to give quiet pass
    Through your dominions for this enterprise,
    On such regards
 of safety and allowance
    As therein are set down.
  King. It likes us well;
    And at our mo
re consider'd time we'll read,
    Answer, and think upon this business.
    Meantime we thank you
 for your well-took labour.
    Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together.
    Most welcome h
ome!                       Exeunt Ambassadors.
  Pol. This business is well ended.
    My liege, a
nd madam, to expostulate
    What majesty should be, what duty is,
    Why day is day, night is ni
ght, and time is time.
    Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time.
    Therefore, since br
evity is the soul of wit,
    And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
    I will be brie
f. Your noble son is mad.
    Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,
    What is't but to be 
nothing else but mad?
    But let that go.
  Queen. More matter, with less art.
  Pol. Madam, I s
wear I use no art at all.
    That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
    And pity 'tis 't
is true. A foolish figure!
    But farewell it, for I will use no art.
    Mad let us grant him th
en. And now remains
    That we find out the cause of this effect-
    Or rather say, the cause of
 this defect,
    For this effect defective comes by cause.
    Thus it remains, and the remainder
 thus.
    Perpend.
    I have a daughter (have while she is mine),
    Who in her duty and obedi
ence, mark,
    Hath given me this. Now gather, and surmise.
                                     
        [Reads] the letter.
    'To the celestial, and my soul's idol, the most beautified
      O
phelia,'-

    That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is a vile
      phrase.
    But
 you shall hear. Thus:
                                                        [Reads.]
    'In he
r excellent white bosom, these, &c.'
  Queen. Came this from Hamlet to her?
  Pol. Good madam, sta
y awhile. I will be faithful.     [Reads.]


          'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
         
   Doubt that the sun doth move;
          Doubt truth to be a liar;
            But never doubt I
 love.
      'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers; I have not art
to
    reckon my groans; 
but that I love thee best, O most best,
believe
    it. Adieu.
      'Thine evermore, most dear l
ady, whilst this machine is to
him,

HAMLET.'

    This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown m
e;
    And more above, hath his solicitings,
    As they fell out by time, by means, and place,
 
   All given to mine ear.
  King. But how hath she
    Receiv'd his love?
  Pol. What do you thin
k of me?
  King. As of a man faithful and honourable.
  Pol. I would fain prove so. But what might
 you think,
    When I had seen this hot love on the wing
    (As I perceiv'd it, I must tell you 
that,
    Before my daughter told me), what might you,
    Or my dear Majesty your queen here, thi
nk,
    If I had play'd the desk or table book,
    Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
 
   Or look'd upon this love with idle sight?
    What might you think? No, I went round to work
  
  And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
    'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star.
    Thi
s must not be.' And then I prescripts gave her,
    That she should lock herself from his resort,

    Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
    Which done, she took the fruits of my advice,
    
And he, repulsed, a short tale to make,
    Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
    Thence to a
 watch, thence into a weakness,
    Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
    Into the m
adness wherein now he raves,
    And all we mourn for.
  King. Do you think 'tis this?
  Queen. i
t may be, very like.
  Pol. Hath there been such a time- I would fain know that-
    That I have P
ositively said ''Tis so,'
    When it prov'd otherwise.?
  King. Not that I know.
  Pol. [points 
to his head and shoulder] Take this from this, if
this
      be otherwise.
    If circumstances l
ead me, I will find
    Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
    Within the centre.
  Ki
ng. How may we try it further?
  Pol. You know sometimes he walks for hours together
    Here in t
he lobby.
  Queen. So he does indeed.
  Pol. At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him.
    Be
 you and I behind an arras then.
    Mark the encounter. If he love her not,
    And he not from h
is reason fall'n thereon
    Let me be no assistant for a state,
    But keep a farm and carters.

  King. We will try it.

                 Enter Hamlet, reading on a book.

  Queen. But look w
here sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
  Pol. Away, I do beseech you, both away
    I'll board 
him presently. O, give me leave.
                       Exeunt King and Queen, [with Attendants].

    How does my good Lord Hamlet?
  Ham. Well, God-a-mercy.
  Pol. Do you know me, my lord?
  Ham
. Excellent well. You are a fishmonger.
  Pol. Not I, my lord.
  Ham. Then I would you were so hon
est a man.
  Pol. Honest, my lord?
  Ham. Ay, sir. To be honest, as this world goes, is to be one

man
    pick'd out of ten thousand.
  Pol. That's very true, my lord.
  Ham. For if the sun bree
d maggots in a dead dog, being a god
    kissing carrion- Have you a daughter?
  Pol. I have, my l
ord.
  Ham. Let her not walk i' th' sun. Conception is a blessing, but
not
    as your daughter m
ay conceive. Friend, look to't.
  Pol. [aside] How say you by that? Still harping on my daughter.

Yet
    he knew me not at first. He said I was a fishmonger. He is
far
    gone, far gone! And tr
uly in my youth I suff'red much
extremity
    for love- very near this. I'll speak to him again.- 
What do
you
    read, my lord?
  Ham. Words, words, words.
  Pol. What is the matter, my lord?

  Ham. Between who?
  Pol. I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
  Ham. Slanders, sir; for th
e satirical rogue says here that old
men
    have grey beards; that their faces are wrinkled; thei
r eyes
    purging thick amber and plum-tree gum; and that they have a
    plentiful lack of wit, 
together with most weak hams. All
which,
    sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, y
et I
hold it
    not honesty to have it thus set down; for you yourself, sir,
    should be old a
s I am if, like a crab, you could go backward.

  Pol. [aside] Though this be madness, yet there i
s a method
in't.-
   Will You walk out of the air, my lord?
  Ham. Into my grave?
  Pol. Indeed,
 that is out o' th' air. [Aside] How pregnant
sometimes
    his replies are! a happiness that ofte
n madness hits on,
which
    reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of.
I
    
will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting
between
    him and my daughter.- My hon
ourable lord, I will most humbly
take
    my leave of you.
  Ham. You cannot, sir, take from me a
nything that I will more
    willingly part withal- except my life, except my life, except
my
   
 life,

                    Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Pol. Fare you well, my lord.

  Ham. These tedious old fools!
  Pol. You go to seek the Lord Hamlet. There he is.
  Ros. [to Po
lonius] God save you, sir!
                                                Exit [Polonius].

  Gu
il. My honour'd lord!
  Ros. My most dear lord!
  Ham. My excellent good friends! How dost thou, G
uildenstern?
Ah,
    Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
  Ros. As the indifferent children o
f the earth.
  Guil. Happy in that we are not over-happy.
    On Fortune's cap we are not the very
 button.
  Ham. Nor the soles of her shoe?
  Ros. Neither, my lord.
  Ham. Then you live about he
r waist, or in the middle of her
    favours?
  Guil. Faith, her privates we.
  Ham. In the secre
t parts of Fortune? O! most true! she is a
    strumpet. What news ?
  Ros. None, my lord, but tha
t the world's grown honest.
  Ham. Then is doomsday near! But your news is not true. Let me
    qu
estion more in particular. What have you, my good friends,
    deserved at the hands of Fortune tha
t she sends you to prison
    hither?
  Guil. Prison, my lord?
  Ham. Denmark's a prison.
  Ros.
 Then is the world one.
  Ham. A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and
    dung
eons, Denmark being one o' th' worst.
  Ros. We think not so, my lord.
  Ham. Why, then 'tis none 
to you; for there is nothing either
good
    or bad but thinking makes it so. To me it is a prison
.
  Ros. Why, then your ambition makes it one. 'Tis too narrow for
your
    mind.
  Ham. O God, 
I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a
    king of infinite space, were it not that I 
have bad dreams.
  Guil. Which dreams indeed are ambition; for the very substance
of
    the ambi
tious is merely the shadow of a dream.
  Ham. A dream itself is but a shadow.
  Ros. Truly, and I 
hold ambition of so airy and light a quality
that
    it is but a shadow's shadow.
  Ham. Then ar
e our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and
outstretch'd
    heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we 
to th' court? for, by
my
    fay, I cannot reason.
  Both. We'll wait upon you.
  Ham. No such m
atter! I will not sort you with the rest of my
    servants; for, to speak to you like an honest ma
n, I am most
    dreadfully attended. But in the beaten way of friendship,
what
    make you at E
lsinore?
  Ros. To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
  Ham. Beggar that I am, I am even poor 
in thanks; but I thank
you;
    and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny.
Were

    you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free
    visitation? Come, deal justly wit
h me. Come, come! Nay,
speak.
  Guil. What should we say, my lord?
  Ham. Why, anything- but to t
h' purpose. You were sent for; and
    there is a kind of confession in your looks, which your
mod
esties
    have not craft enough to colour. I know the good King and
Queen
    have sent for you.

  Ros. To what end, my lord?
  Ham. That you must teach me. But let me conjure you by the
rights

    of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the
    obligation of our ever-preserve
d love, and by what more dear
a
    better proposer could charge you withal, be even and direct
w
ith
    me, whether you were sent for or no.
  Ros. [aside to Guildenstern] What say you?
  Ham. 
[aside] Nay then, I have an eye of you.- If you love me,
hold
    not off.
  Guil. My lord, we we
re sent for.
  Ham. I will tell you why. So shall my anticipation prevent your
    discovery, and 
your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no
    feather. I have of late- but wherefore I know not- 
lost all
my
    mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes
so
    heavily with 
my disposition that this goodly frame, the
earth,
    seems to me a sterile promontory; this most 
excellent canopy,
the
    air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this
majestical
    r
oof fretted with golden fire- why, it appeareth no other
thing
    to me than a foul and pestilent
 congregation of vapours. What
a
    piece of work is a man! how noble in reason! how infinite in

    faculties! in form and moving how express and admirable! in
    action how like an angel! in a
pprehension how like a god! the
    beauty of the world, the paragon of animals! And yet to me
wha
t
    is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me- no, nor
woman
    neither, though by you
r smiling you seem to say so.
  Ros. My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.
  Ham. Why d
id you laugh then, when I said 'Man delights not me'?
  Ros. To think, my lord, if you delight not 
in man, what lenten
    entertainment the players shall receive from you. We coted
them
    on th
e way, and hither are they coming to offer you service.
  Ham. He that plays the king shall be welc
ome- his Majesty shall
    have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil
and
    
target; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humorous man
shall
    end his part in peace; the clo
wn shall make those laugh whose
    lungs are tickle o' th' sere; and the lady shall say her mind

    freely, or the blank verse shall halt for't. What players are
    they?
  Ros. Even those you 
were wont to take such delight in, the
    tragedians of the city.
  Ham. How chances it they trav
el? Their residence, both in
    reputation and profit, was better both ways.
  Ros. I think their
 inhibition comes by the means of the late
    innovation.
  Ham. Do they hold the same estimation
 they did when I was in
the
    city? Are they so follow'd?
  Ros. No indeed are they not.
  Ham
. How comes it? Do they grow rusty?
  Ros. Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there

is,
    sir, an eyrie of children, little eyases, that cry out on the
top
    of question and a
re most tyrannically clapp'd for't. These
are now
    the fashion, and so berattle the common stag
es (so they call
    them) that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goosequills and
    dare scarce
 come thither.
  Ham. What, are they children? Who maintains 'em? How are they
    escoted? Will t
hey pursue the quality no longer than they can
    sing? Will they not say afterwards, if they shou
ld grow
    themselves to common players (as it is most like, if their
means
    are no better), 
their writers do them wrong to make them
exclaim
    against their own succession.
  Ros. Faith, 
there has been much to do on both sides; and the
nation
    holds it no sin to tarre them to contr
oversy. There was, for
a
    while, no money bid for argument unless the poet and the
player
   
 went to cuffs in the question.
  Ham. Is't possible?
  Guil. O, there has been much throwing abou
t of brains.
  Ham. Do the boys carry it away?
  Ros. Ay, that they do, my lord- Hercules and his 
load too.
  Ham. It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark,
and
    those that woul
d make mows at him while my father lived give
    twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for
 his picture
in
    little. 'Sblood, there is something in this more than
natural, if
    philos
ophy could find it out.

                     Flourish for the Players.

  Guil. There are the p
layers.
  Ham. Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come!
Th'
    appurtenance of 
welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me
comply
    with you in this garb, lest my extent to the pl
ayers (which I
    tell you must show fairly outwards) should more appear like
    entertainment t
han yours. You are welcome. But my
uncle-father
    and aunt-mother are deceiv'd.
  Guil. In what
, my dear lord?
  Ham. I am but mad north-north-west. When the wind is southerly
I
    know a haw
k from a handsaw.

                            Enter Polonius.

  Pol. Well be with you, gentlem
en!
  Ham. Hark you, Guildenstern- and you too- at each ear a hearer!
    That great baby you see 
there is not yet out of his swaddling
    clouts.
  Ros. Happily he's the second time come to them
; for they say an
old
    man is twice a child.
  Ham. I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the
 players. Mark
it.-
   You say right, sir; a Monday morning; twas so indeed.
  Pol. My lord, I ha
ve news to tell you.
  Ham. My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an
actor in
    Ro
me-
  Pol. The actors are come hither, my lord.
  Ham. Buzz, buzz!
  Pol. Upon my honour-
  Ham.
 Then came each actor on his ass-
  Pol. The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy,

    history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral,
    tragical-historical, tragical-co
mical-historical-pastoral;
scene
    individable, or poem unlimited. Seneca cannot be too heavy,

nor
    Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these
are
    the only men.
  Ha
m. O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
  Pol. What treasure had he, my lord?

  Ham. Why,

         'One fair daughter, and no more,
           The which he loved passing well
.'

  Pol. [aside] Still on my daughter.
  Ham. Am I not i' th' right, old Jephthah?
  Pol. If y
ou call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I
    love passing well.
  Ham. Nay, that fol
lows not.
  Pol. What follows then, my lord?
  Ham. Why,

           'As by lot, God wot,'

 a
nd then, you know,

           'It came to pass, as most like it was.'

    The first row of the
 pious chanson will show you more; for
look
    where my abridgment comes.

                    
 Enter four or five Players.

    You are welcome, masters; welcome, all.- I am glad to see
thee

    well.- Welcome, good friends.- O, my old friend? Why, thy
face is
    valanc'd since I saw th
ee last. Com'st' thou to' beard me in
    Denmark?- What, my young lady and mistress? By'r Lady, yo
ur
    ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last by the
    altitude of a chopine. Pra
y God your voice, like a piece of
    uncurrent gold, be not crack'd within the ring.- Masters, you

are
    all welcome. We'll e'en to't like French falconers, fly at
    anything we see. We'll ha
ve a speech straight. Come, give us
a
    taste of your quality. Come, a passionate speech.
  1. 
Play. What speech, my good lord?
  Ham. I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never
acte
d;
    or if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember,
pleas'd
    not the million, 'twas
 caviary to the general; but it was (as
I
    receiv'd it, and others, whose judgments in such mat
ters
cried in
    the top of mine) an excellent play, well digested in the
scenes,
    set down 
with as much modesty as cunning. I remember one said
    there were no sallets in the lines to make
 the matter
savoury,
    nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of
    affectat
ion; but call'd it an honest method, as wholesome as
    sweet, and by very much more handsome than
 fine. One speech
in't
    I chiefly lov'd. 'Twas AEneas' tale to Dido, and thereabout
of it
   
 especially where he speaks of Priam's slaughter. If it live
in
    your memory, begin at this lin
e- let me see, let me see:

         'The rugged Pyrrhus, like th' Hyrcanian beast-'

    'Tis n
ot so; it begins with Pyrrhus:

         'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
         Black
 as his purpose, did the night resemble
         When he lay couched in the ominous horse,
       
  Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd
         With heraldry more dismal. Head to foot

         Now is be total gules, horridly trick'd
         With blood of fathers, mothers, daughte
rs, sons,
         Bak'd and impasted with the parching streets,
         That lend a tyrannous an
d a damned light
         To their lord's murther. Roasted in wrath and fire,
         And thus o'
ersized with coagulate gore,
         With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
         Old 
grandsire Priam seeks.'

    So, proceed you.
  Pol. Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good ac
cent and good
     discretion.

  1. Play. 'Anon he finds him,
      Striking too short at Greek
s. His antique sword,
      Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
      Repugnant to command
. Unequal match'd,
      Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide;
      But with the whiff a
nd wind of his fell sword
      Th' unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
      Seeming to 
feel this blow, with flaming top
      Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
      Takes pr
isoner Pyrrhus' ear. For lo! his sword,
      Which was declining on the milky head
      Of rever
end Priam, seem'd i' th' air to stick.
      So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
      And, li
ke a neutral to his will and matter,
      Did nothing.
      But, as we often see, against some s
torm,
      A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
      The bold winds speechless, and t
he orb below
      As hush as death- anon the dreadful thunder
      Doth rend the region; so, aft
er Pyrrhus' pause,
      Aroused vengeance sets him new awork;
      And never did the Cyclops' ha
mmers fall
      On Mars's armour, forg'd for proof eterne,
      With less remorse than Pyrrhus' 
bleeding sword
      Now falls on Priam.
      Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods,
   
   In general synod take away her power;
      Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
  
    And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
      As low as to the fiends!

  Pol. This 
is too long.
  Ham. It shall to the barber's, with your beard.- Prithee say
on.
    He's for a ji
g or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps. Say on;
come to
    Hecuba.

  1. Play. 'But who, O who, ha
d seen the mobled queen-'

  Ham. 'The mobled queen'?
  Pol. That's good! 'Mobled queen' is good.


  1. Play. 'Run barefoot up and down, threat'ning the flames
      With bisson rheum; a clout u
pon that head
      Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
      About her lank and all o'er
teemed loins,
      A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up-
      Who this had seen, with tongu
e in venom steep'd
      'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have pronounc'd.
      But if the g
ods themselves did see her then,
      When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
      In Mincing 
with his sword her husband's limbs,
      The instant burst of clamour that she made
      (Unless
 things mortal move them not at all)
      Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven
      
And passion in the gods.'

  Pol. Look, whe'r he has not turn'd his colour, and has tears
in's
 
   eyes. Prithee no more!
  Ham. 'Tis well. I'll have thee speak out the rest of this
soon.-
    
Good my lord, will you see the players well bestow'd? Do you
    hear? Let them be well us'd; for t
hey are the abstract and
brief
    chronicles of the time. After your death you were better have

a
    bad epitaph than their ill report while you live.
  Pol. My lord, I will use them according 
to their desert.
  Ham. God's bodykins, man, much better! Use every man after his
    desert, and 
who should scape whipping? Use them after your
own
    honour and dignity. The less they deserve, 
the more merit is
in
    your bounty. Take them in.
  Pol. Come, sirs.
  Ham. Follow him, friend
s. We'll hear a play to-morrow.
                 Exeunt Polonius and Players [except the First].
 
   Dost thou hear me, old friend? Can you play 'The Murther of
    Gonzago'?
  1. Play. Ay, my lor
d.
  Ham. We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need, study a
    speech of some dozen or s
ixteen lines which I would set down
and
    insert in't, could you not?
  1. Play. Ay, my lord.

  Ham. Very well. Follow that lord- and look you mock him not.
                                    
        [Exit First Player.]
    My good friends, I'll leave you till night. You are welcome
to
 
   Elsinore.
  Ros. Good my lord!
  Ham. Ay, so, God b' wi' ye!
                            [Exeu
nt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
    Now I am alone.
    O what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
  
  Is it not monstrous that this player here,
    But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
    Coul
d force his soul so to his own conceit
    That, from her working, all his visage wann'd,
    Tear
s in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
    A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
    Wit
h forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!
    For Hecuba!
    What's Hecuba to him, or he to He
cuba,
    That he should weep for her? What would he do,
    Had he the motive and the cue for pas
sion
    That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
    And cleave the general ear with horr
id speech;
    Make mad the guilty and appal the free,
    Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed

    The very faculties of eyes and ears.
    Yet I,
    A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak
 
   Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
    And can say nothing! No, not for a king,
    Up
on whose property and most dear life
    A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
    Who calls me
 villain? breaks my pate across?
    Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?
    Tweaks me by
 th' nose? gives me the lie i' th' throat
    As deep as to the lungs? Who does me this, ha?
    '
Swounds, I should take it! for it cannot be
    But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall
    To make 
oppression bitter, or ere this
    I should have fatted all the region kites
    With this slave's
 offal. Bloody bawdy villain!
    Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
    O, ve
ngeance!
    Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
    That I, the son of a dear father murth
er'd,
    Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
    Must (like a whore) unpack my heart with 
words
    And fall a-cursing like a very drab,
    A scullion!
    Fie upon't! foh! About, my bra
in! Hum, I have heard
    That guilty creatures, sitting at a play,
    Have by the very cunning o
f the scene
    Been struck so to the soul that presently
    They have proclaim'd their malefacti
ons;
    For murther, though it have no tongue, will speak
    With most miraculous organ, I'll ha
ve these Players
    Play something like the murther of my father
    Before mine uncle. I'll obse
rve his looks;
    I'll tent him to the quick. If he but blench,
    I know my course. The spirit 
that I have seen
    May be a devil; and the devil hath power
    T' assume a pleasing shape; yea,
 and perhaps
    Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
    As he is very potent with such spirits,

    Abuses me to damn me. I'll have grounds
    More relative than this. The play's the thing
  
  Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King.         Exit.

ACT III. Scene I
.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz, Guildenster
n,
and Lords.

  King. And can you by no drift of circumstance
    Get from him why he puts on t
his confusion,
    Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
    With turbulent and dangerous lunac
y?
  Ros. He does confess he feels himself distracted,
    But from what cause he will by no means
 speak.
  Guil. Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
    But with a crafty madness keeps aloo
f
    When we would bring him on to some confession
    Of his true state.
  Queen. Did he receiv
e you well?
  Ros. Most like a gentleman.
  Guil. But with much forcing of his disposition.
  Ros
. Niggard of question, but of our demands
    Most free in his reply.
  Queen. Did you assay him

    To any pastime?
  Ros. Madam, it so fell out that certain players
    We o'erraught on the way
. Of these we told him,
    And there did seem in him a kind of joy
    To hear of it. They are he
re about the court,
    And, as I think, they have already order
    This night to play before him
.
  Pol. 'Tis most true;
    And he beseech'd me to entreat your Majesties
    To hear and see th
e matter.
  King. With all my heart, and it doth much content me
    To hear him so inclin'd.
   
 Good gentlemen, give him a further edge
    And drive his purpose on to these delights.
  Ros. We
 shall, my lord.
                            Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
  King. Sweet Ge
rtrude, leave us too;
    For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
    That he, as 'twere by ac
cident, may here
    Affront Ophelia.
    Her father and myself (lawful espials)
    Will so best
ow ourselves that, seeing unseen,
    We may of their encounter frankly judge
    And gather by hi
m, as he is behav'd,
    If't be th' affliction of his love, or no,
    That thus he suffers for.

  Queen. I shall obey you;
    And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
    That your good beauties 
be the happy cause
    Of Hamlet's wildness. So shall I hope your virtues
    Will bring him to hi
s wonted way again,
    To both your honours.
  Oph. Madam, I wish it may.
                      
                             [Exit Queen.]
  Pol. Ophelia, walk you here.- Gracious, so please you,

    We will bestow ourselves.- [To Ophelia] Read on this book,
    That show of such an exercise 
may colour
    Your loneliness.- We are oft to blame in this,
    'Tis too much prov'd, that with 
devotion's visage
    And pious action we do sugar o'er
    The Devil himself.
  King. [aside] O,
 'tis too true!
    How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
    The harlot's cheek, 
beautied with plast'ring art,
    Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
    Than is my deed 
to my most painted word.
    O heavy burthen!
  Pol. I hear him coming. Let's withdraw, my lord.

                                      Exeunt King and Polonius].

                           Enter
 Hamlet.

  Ham. To be, or not to be- that is the question:
    Whether 'tis nobler in the mind t
o suffer
    The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
    Or to take arms against a sea of trou
bles,
    And by opposing end them. To die- to sleep-
    No more; and by a sleep to say we end
 
   The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks
    That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation
 
   Devoutly to be wish'd. To die- to sleep.
    To sleep- perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub!

    For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
    When we have shuffled off this mortal coil
,
    Must give us pause. There's the respect
    That makes calamity of so long life.
    For wh
o would bear the whips and scorns of time,
    Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
 
   The pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay,
    The insolence of office, and the spurns
    Th
at patient merit of th' unworthy takes,
    When he himself might his quietus make
    With a bare
 bodkin? Who would these fardels bear,
    To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
    But that the
 dread of something after death-
    The undiscover'd country, from whose bourn
    No traveller r
eturns- puzzles the will,
    And makes us rather bear those ills we have
    Than fly to others t
hat we know not of?
    Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
    And thus the native hue o
f resolution
    Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
    And enterprises of great pith
 and moment
    With this regard their currents turn awry
    And lose the name of action.- Soft y
ou now!
    The fair Ophelia!- Nymph, in thy orisons
    Be all my sins rememb'red.
  Oph. Good m
y lord,
    How does your honour for this many a day?
  Ham. I humbly thank you; well, well, well.

  Oph. My lord, I have remembrances of yours
    That I have longed long to re-deliver.
    I pr
ay you, now receive them.
  Ham. No, not I!
    I never gave you aught.
  Oph. My honour'd lord, 
you know right well you did,
    And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd
    As made the t
hings more rich. Their perfume lost,
    Take these again; for to the noble mind
    Rich gifts wa
x poor when givers prove unkind.
    There, my lord.
  Ham. Ha, ha! Are you honest?
  Oph. My lor
d?
  Ham. Are you fair?
  Oph. What means your lordship?
  Ham. That if you be honest and fair, y
our honesty should admit
no
    discourse to your beauty.
  Oph. Could beauty, my lord, have bett
er commerce than with
honesty?
  Ham. Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform
  
  honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty
can
    translate beauty into his li
keness. This was sometime a
paradox,
    but now the time gives it proof. I did love you once.
  
Oph. Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
  Ham. You should not have believ'd me; for virtue ca
nnot so
    inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it. I loved
you
    not.
  Oph. I was
 the more deceived.
  Ham. Get thee to a nunnery! Why wouldst thou be a breeder of
    sinners? I 
am myself indifferent honest, but yet I could
accuse
    me of such things that it were better my 
mother had not borne
me.
    I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more offences at
my
  
  beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give
    them shape, or time to act them
 in. What should such fellows
as I
    do, crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves

all;
    believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where's your
    father?
  Oph. At home,
 my lord.
  Ham. Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool
    nowhere but in's ow
n house. Farewell.
  Oph. O, help him, you sweet heavens!
  Ham. If thou dost marry, I'll give the
e this plague for thy
dowry:
    be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not
escape

    calumny. Get thee to a nunnery. Go, farewell. Or if thou wilt
    needs marry, marry a fool; 
for wise men know well enough what
    monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go; and quickly too
.
    Farewell.
  Oph. O heavenly powers, restore him!
  Ham. I have heard of your paintings too,
 well enough. God hath
    given you one face, and you make yourselves another. You jig,
you
    
amble, and you lisp; you nickname God's creatures and make
your
    wantonness your ignorance. Go 
to, I'll no more on't! it hath
made
    me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages. Those that 
are
    married already- all but one- shall live; the rest shall keep
as
    they are. To a nunne
ry, go.                            Exit.
  Oph. O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
    The c
ourtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword,
    Th' expectancy and rose of the fair state,

    The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
    Th' observ'd of all observers- quite, quite d
own!
    And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
    That suck'd the honey of his music vows,

    Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
    Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and har
sh;
    That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
    Blasted with ecstasy. O, woe is me
   
 T' have seen what I have seen, see what I see!

                   Enter King and Polonius.

  
King. Love? his affections do not that way tend;
    Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a lit
tle,
    Was not like madness. There's something in his soul
    O'er which his melancholy sits on
 brood;
    And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
    Will be some danger; which for to preven
t,
    I have in quick determination
    Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England
    For
 the demand of our neglected tribute.
    Haply the seas, and countries different,
    With variab
le objects, shall expel
    This something-settled matter in his heart,
    Whereon his brains sti
ll beating puts him thus
    From fashion of himself. What think you on't?
  Pol. It shall do well
. But yet do I believe
    The origin and commencement of his grief
    Sprung from neglected love
.- How now, Ophelia?
    You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said.
    We heard it all.- My lord
, do as you please;
    But if you hold it fit, after the play
    Let his queen mother all alone 
entreat him
    To show his grief. Let her be round with him;
    And I'll be plac'd so please you
, in the ear
    Of all their conference. If she find him not,
    To England send him; or confine
 him where
    Your wisdom best shall think.
  King. It shall be so.
    Madness in great ones mu
st not unwatch'd go.         Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. hall in the Castle.

Enter Haml
et and three of the Players.

  Ham. Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounc'd it to you,
   
 trippingly on the tongue. But if you mouth it, as many of our
    players do, I had as live the to
wn crier spoke my lines. Nor
do
    not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all
  
  gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and (as I may say)
    whirlwind of your passion, you m
ust acquire and beget a
    temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to
the
    s
oul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion
to
    tatters, to very rags, to spli
t the cars of the groundlings,
who
    (for the most part) are capable of nothing but inexplicable

dumb
    shows and noise. I would have such a fellow whipp'd for
o'erdoing
    Termagant. It ou
t-herods Herod. Pray you avoid it.
  Player. I warrant your honour.
  Ham. Be not too tame neither
; but let your own discretion be
your
    tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the acti
on;
with
    this special observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of
    nature: for anythi
ng so overdone is from the purpose of
playing,
    whose end, both at the first and now, was and i
s, to hold, as
    'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show Virtue her own
feature,
    scorn her
 own image, and the very age and body of the time
his
    form and pressure. Now this overdone, or
 come tardy off,
though
    it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious
    grieve
; the censure of the which one must in your allowance
    o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, t
here be players that
I
    have seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly (not
to
    
speak it profanely), that, neither having the accent of
    Christians, nor the gait of Christian, 
pagan, nor man, have
so
    strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of Nature's
    journe
ymen had made men, and not made them well, they
imitated
    humanity so abominably.
  Player. I 
hope we have reform'd that indifferently with us,
sir.
  Ham. O, reform it altogether! And let tho
se that play your
clowns
    speak no more than is set down for them. For there be of them
    th
at will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren
    spectators to laugh too, though in 
the mean time some
necessary
    question of the play be then to be considered. That's
villanous

    and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it.
Go
    make you ready.
         
                                        Exeunt Players.

            Enter Polonius, Rosencrantz, 
and Guildenstern.

    How now, my lord? Will the King hear this piece of work?
  Pol. And the Qu
een too, and that presently.
  Ham. Bid the players make haste, [Exit Polonius.] Will you two
    
help to hasten them?
  Both. We will, my lord.                       Exeunt they two.
  Ham. What,
 ho, Horatio!

                      Enter Horatio.

  Hor. Here, sweet lord, at your service.

  Ham. Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
    As e'er my conversation cop'd withal.
  Hor. O, my
 dear lord!
  Ham. Nay, do not think I flatter;
    For what advancement may I hope from thee,
  
  That no revenue hast but thy good spirits
    To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be fla
tter'd?
    No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
    And crook the pregnant hinges of the 
knee
    Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
    Since my dear soul was mistress of h
er choice
    And could of men distinguish, her election
    Hath seal'd thee for herself. For tho
u hast been
    As one, in suff'ring all, that suffers nothing;
    A man that Fortune's buffets a
nd rewards
    Hast ta'en with equal thanks; and blest are those
    Whose blood and judgment are 
so well commingled
    That they are not a pipe for Fortune's finger
    To sound what stop she pl
ease. Give me that man
    That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
    In my heart's core
, ay, in my heart of heart,
    As I do thee. Something too much of this I
    There is a play to-
night before the King.
    One scene of it comes near the circumstance,
    Which I have told thee
, of my father's death.
    I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
    Even with the very comm
ent of thy soul
    Observe my uncle. If his occulted guilt
    Do not itself unkennel in one spee
ch,
    It is a damned ghost that we have seen,
    And my imaginations are as foul
    As Vulcan
's stithy. Give him heedful note;
    For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,
    And after we wil
l both our judgments join
    In censure of his seeming.
  Hor. Well, my lord.
    If he steal au
ght the whilst this play is playing,
    And scape detecting, I will pay the theft.

    Sound a 
flourish. [Enter Trumpets and Kettledrums. Danish
    march. [Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia,
 Rosencrantz,
      Guildenstern, and other Lords attendant, with the Guard
                      
 carrying torches.

  Ham. They are coming to the play. I must be idle.
    Get you a place.
  K
ing. How fares our cousin Hamlet?
  Ham. Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish. I eat the
a
ir,
    promise-cramm'd. You cannot feed capons so.
  King. I have nothing with this answer, Hamle
t. These words are
not
    mine.
  Ham. No, nor mine now. [To Polonius] My lord, you play'd once

    i' th' university, you say?
  Pol. That did I, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.
  Ham
. What did you enact?
  Pol. I did enact Julius Caesar; I was kill'd i' th' Capitol;
Brutus
    k
ill'd me.
  Ham. It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf
there. Be
    the players r
eady.
  Ros. Ay, my lord. They stay upon your patience.
  Queen. Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit 
by me.
  Ham. No, good mother. Here's metal more attractive.
  Pol. [to the King] O, ho! do you ma
rk that?
  Ham. Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
                                  [Sits down at Oph
elia's feet.]

  Oph. No, my lord.
  Ham. I mean, my head upon your lap?
  Oph. Ay, my lord.
  
Ham. Do you think I meant country matters?
  Oph. I think nothing, my lord.
  Ham. That's a fair t
hought to lie between maids' legs.
  Oph. What is, my lord?
  Ham. Nothing.
  Oph. You are merry,
 my lord.
  Ham. Who, I?
  Oph. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. O God, your only jig-maker! What should a man
 do but be
merry?
    For look you how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father
died
    within
 's two hours.
  Oph. Nay 'tis twice two months, my lord.
  Ham. So long? Nay then, let the devil 
wear black, for I'll have
a
    suit of sables. O heavens! die two months ago, and not
forgotten

    yet? Then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his
life
    half a year. But, by'r L
ady, he must build churches then; or
else
    shall he suffer not thinking on, with the hobby-hors
e, whose

    epitaph is 'For O, for O, the hobby-horse is forgot!'

               Hautboys pla
y. The dumb show enters.

    Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing
    him
 and he her. She kneels, and makes show of protestation
    unto him. He takes her up, and declines
 his head upon her
    neck. He lays him down upon a bank of flowers. She, seeing
    him asleep, 
leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his
    crown, kisses it, pours poison in the sleeper
's ears, and
    leaves him. The Queen returns, finds the King dead, and makes
    passionate acti
on. The Poisoner with some three or four
Mutes,
    comes in again, seem to condole with her. The 
dead body is
    carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with gifts; she
    seems harsh and un
willing awhile, but in the end accepts
    his love.
                                             
            Exeunt.

  Oph. What means this, my lord?
  Ham. Marry, this is miching malhecho; it 
means mischief.
  Oph. Belike this show imports the argument of the play.

                      
Enter Prologue.

  Ham. We shall know by this fellow. The players cannot keep
counsel;
    they'
ll tell all.
  Oph. Will he tell us what this show meant?
  Ham. Ay, or any show that you'll show 
him. Be not you asham'd
to
    show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means.
  Oph. You are na
ught, you are naught! I'll mark the play.

    Pro. For us, and for our tragedy,
      Here stoop
ing to your clemency,
      We beg your hearing patiently.                     [Exit.]

  Ham. Is
 this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
  Oph. 'Tis brief, my lord.
  Ham. As woman's love.

  
            Enter [two Players as] King and Queen.

    King. Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart
 gone round
      Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
      And thirty dozen moons with 
borrowed sheen
      About the world have times twelve thirties been,
      Since love our hearts,
 and Hymen did our hands,
      Unite comutual in most sacred bands.
    Queen. So many journeys m
ay the sun and moon
      Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
      But woe is me! you are 
so sick of late,
      So far from cheer and from your former state.
      That I distrust you. Ye
t, though I distrust,
      Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must;
      For women's fear and l
ove holds quantity,
      In neither aught, or in extremity.
      Now what my love is, proof hath
 made you know;
      And as my love is siz'd, my fear is so.
      Where love is great, the littl
est doubts are fear;
      Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.
    King. Faith,
 I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;
      My operant powers their functions leave to do.
  
    And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
      Honour'd, belov'd, and haply one as kind

      For husband shalt thou-
    Queen. O, confound the rest!
      Such love must needs be treas
on in my breast.
      When second husband let me be accurst!
      None wed the second but who ki
lled the first.

  Ham. [aside] Wormwood, wormwood!

    Queen. The instances that second marria
ge move
      Are base respects of thrift, but none of love.
      A second time I kill my husband
 dead
      When second husband kisses me in bed.
    King. I do believe you think what now you sp
eak;
      But what we do determine oft we break.
      Purpose is but the slave to memory,
     
 Of violent birth, but poor validity;
      Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree,
    
  But fall unshaken when they mellow be.
      Most necessary 'tis that we forget
      To pay our
selves what to ourselves is debt.
      What to ourselves in passion we propose,
      The passion
 ending, doth the purpose lose.
      The violence of either grief or joy
      Their own enacture
s with themselves destroy.
      Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
      Grief joys, 
joy grieves, on slender accident.
      This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
      That
 even our loves should with our fortunes change;
      For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
 
     Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
      The great man down, you mark his favour
ite flies,
      The poor advanc'd makes friends of enemies;
      And hitherto doth love on fortu
ne tend,
      For who not needs shall never lack a friend,
      And who in want a hollow friend 
doth try,
      Directly seasons him his enemy.
      But, orderly to end where I begun,
      Ou
r wills and fates do so contrary run
      That our devices still are overthrown;
      Our though
ts are ours, their ends none of our own.
      So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
      But
 die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
    Queen. Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven lig
ht,
      Sport and repose lock from me day and night,
      To desperation turn my trust and hope
,
      An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope,
      Each opposite that blanks the face of joy

      Meet what I would have well, and it destroy,
      Both here and hence pursue me lasting stri
fe,
      If, once a widow, ever I be wife!

  Ham. If she should break it now!

    King. 'Tis
 deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile.
      My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile
 
     The tedious day with sleep.
    Queen. Sleep rock thy brain,
                                
                    [He] sleeps.
      And never come mischance between us twain!
Exit.

  Ham. 
Madam, how like you this play?
  Queen. The lady doth protest too much, methinks.
  Ham. O, but sh
e'll keep her word.
  King. Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in't?
  Ham. No, no! 
They do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i'
th'
    world.
  King. What do you call the play?

  Ham. 'The Mousetrap.' Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the
    image of a murther done in V
ienna. Gonzago is the duke's
name;
    his wife, Baptista. You shall see anon. 'Tis a knavish piec
e
of
    work; but what o' that? Your Majesty, and we that have free
    souls, it touches us not
. Let the gall'd jade winch; our
withers
    are unwrung.

                         Enter Lucian
us.

    This is one Lucianus, nephew to the King.
  Oph. You are as good as a chorus, my lord.

  Ham. I could interpret between you and your love, if I could
see
    the puppets dallying.
  Op
h. You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
  Ham. It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
 
 Oph. Still better, and worse.
  Ham. So you must take your husbands.- Begin, murtherer. Pox,
leav
e
    thy damnable faces, and begin! Come, the croaking raven doth
    bellow for revenge.

    
Luc. Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
      Confederate season, else no cre
ature seeing;
      Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,
      With Hecate's ban thrice
 blasted, thrice infected,
      Thy natural magic and dire property
      On wholesome life usurp
 immediately.
                                   Pours the poison in his ears.

  Ham. He poisons
 him i' th' garden for's estate. His name's
Gonzago.
    The story is extant, and written in very 
choice Italian. You
    shall see anon how the murtherer gets the love of Gonzago's
wife.
  Oph. 
The King rises.
  Ham. What, frighted with false fire?
  Queen. How fares my lord?
  Pol. Give o'
er the play.
  King. Give me some light! Away!
  All. Lights, lights, lights!
                   
           Exeunt all but Hamlet and Horatio.
  Ham.   Why, let the strucken deer go weep,
       
   The hart ungalled play;
         For some must watch, while some must sleep:
          Thus run
s the world away.
    Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers- if the rest of
my
    fortun
es turn Turk with me-with two Provincial roses on my
raz'd
    shoes, get me a fellowship in a cry
 of players, sir?
  Hor. Half a share.
  Ham.   A whole one I!
         For thou dost know, O Dam
on dear,
           This realm dismantled was
         Of Jove himself; and now reigns here
     
      A very, very- pajock.
  Hor. You might have rhym'd.
  Ham. O good Horatio, I'll take the gho
st's word for a thousand
    pound! Didst perceive?
  Hor. Very well, my lord.
  Ham. Upon the ta
lk of the poisoning?
  Hor. I did very well note him.
  Ham.   Aha! Come, some music! Come, the re
corders!
         For if the King like not the comedy,
         Why then, belike he likes it not, 
perdy.
    Come, some music!

                Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Guil. Good
 my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.
  Ham. Sir, a whole history.
  Guil. The King, sir-
  Ham
. Ay, sir, what of him?
  Guil. Is in his retirement, marvellous distemper'd.
  Ham. With drink, s
ir?
  Guil. No, my lord; rather with choler.
  Ham. Your wisdom should show itself more richer to 
signify this
to
    the doctor; for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps
    plunge him i
nto far more choler.
  Guil. Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame, and
start
    not 
so wildly from my affair.
  Ham. I am tame, sir; pronounce.
  Guil. The Queen, your mother, in mos
t great affliction of
spirit
    hath sent me to you.
  Ham. You are welcome.
  Guil. Nay, good 
my lord, this courtesy is not of the right
breed.
    If it shall please you to make me a wholesom
e answer, I will
do
    your mother's commandment; if not, your pardon and my return
    shall be
 the end of my business.
  Ham. Sir, I cannot.
  Guil. What, my lord?
  Ham. Make you a wholesome
 answer; my wit's diseas'd. But, sir,
such
    answer as I can make, you shall command; or rather,
 as you
say,
    my mother. Therefore no more, but to the matter! My mother,
you
    say-
  Ros
. Then thus she says: your behaviour hath struck her into
    amazement and admiration.
  Ham. O w
onderful son, that can so stonish a mother! But is
there no
    sequel at the heels of this mother
's admiration? Impart.
  Ros. She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to
bed.
  Ha
m. We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any
    further trade with us?
  Ros. My
 lord, you once did love me.
  Ham. And do still, by these pickers and stealers!
  Ros. Good my lo
rd, what is your cause of distemper? You do
surely
    bar the door upon your own liberty, if you 
deny your griefs
to
    your friend.
  Ham. Sir, I lack advancement.
  Ros. How can that be, whe
n you have the voice of the King
himself
    for your succession in Denmark?
  Ham. Ay, sir, but 
'while the grass grows'- the proverb is
something
    musty.

                     Enter the Pla
yers with recorders.

    O, the recorders! Let me see one. To withdraw with you- why
do
    you
 go about to recover the wind of me, as if you would drive
me
    into a toil?
  Guil. O my lord,
 if my duty be too bold, my love is too
unmannerly.
  Ham. I do not well understand that. Will you
 play upon this
pipe?
  Guil. My lord, I cannot.
  Ham. I pray you.
  Guil. Believe me, I cannot
.
  Ham. I do beseech you.
  Guil. I know, no touch of it, my lord.
  Ham. It is as easy as lying
. Govern these ventages with your
    fingers and thumbs, give it breath with your mouth, and it
w
ill
    discourse most eloquent music. Look you, these are the stops.
  Guil. But these cannot I c
ommand to any utt'rance of harmony. I
    have not the skill.
  Ham. Why, look you now, how unwort
hy a thing you make of me!
You
    would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you
would

    pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound me from my
    lowest note to the top of m
y compass; and there is much
music,
    excellent voice, in this little organ, yet cannot you make
 it
    speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am easier to be play'd on than
a
    pipe? Call me what in
strument you will, though you can fret
me,
    you cannot play upon me.

                       
 Enter Polonius.

    God bless you, sir!
  Pol. My lord, the Queen would speak with you, and pre
sently.
  Ham. Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
  Pol. By th' mass, and 
'tis like a camel indeed.
  Ham. Methinks it is like a weasel.
  Pol. It is back'd like a weasel.

  Ham. Or like a whale.
  Pol. Very like a whale.
  Ham. Then will I come to my mother by-and-by.
- They fool me to
the
    top of my bent.- I will come by-and-by.
  Pol. I will say so.          
                            Exit.
  Ham. 'By-and-by' is easily said.- Leave me, friends.
         
                               [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]

    'Tis now the very witching time of ni
ght,
    When churchyards yawn, and hell itself breathes out
    Contagion to this world. Now coul
d I drink hot blood
    And do such bitter business as the day
    Would quake to look on. Soft! n
ow to my mother!
    O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever
    The soul of Nero enter this fi
rm bosom.
    Let me be cruel, not unnatural;
    I will speak daggers to her, but use none.
    
My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites-
    How in my words somever she be shent,
    To give th
em seals never, my soul, consent!             Exit.




Scene III.
A room in the Castle.

En
ter King, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.

  King. I like him not, nor stands it safe with us
    
To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;
    I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
  
  And he to England shall along with you.
    The terms of our estate may not endure
    Hazard so
 near us as doth hourly grow
    Out of his lunacies.
  Guil. We will ourselves provide.
    Most
 holy and religious fear it is
    To keep those many many bodies safe
    That live and feed upon
 your Majesty.
  Ros. The single and peculiar life is bound
    With all the strength and armour o
f the mind
    To keep itself from noyance; but much more
    That spirit upon whose weal depends 
and rests
    The lives of many. The cesse of majesty
    Dies not alone, but like a gulf doth dra
w
    What's near it with it. It is a massy wheel,
    Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,

    To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
    Are mortis'd and adjoin'd; which when it fa
lls,
    Each small annexment, petty consequence,
    Attends the boist'rous ruin. Never alone
  
  Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.
  King. Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;

    For we will fetters put upon this fear,
    Which now goes too free-footed.
  Both. We will h
aste us.
                                               Exeunt Gentlemen.

                   Ent
er Polonius.

  Pol. My lord, he's going to his mother's closet.
    Behind the arras I'll convey
 myself
    To hear the process. I'll warrant she'll tax him home;
    And, as you said, and wisel
y was it said,
    'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,
    Since nature makes them pa
rtial, should o'erhear
    The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege.
    I'll call upon you
 ere you go to bed
    And tell you what I know.
  King. Thanks, dear my lord.
                  
                              Exit [Polonius].
    O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven;
   
 It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,
    A brother's murther! Pray can I not,
    Though incli
nation be as sharp as will.
    My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent,
    And, like a man to
 double business bound,
    I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
    And both neglect. What
 if this cursed hand
    Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,
    Is there not rain enou
gh in the sweet heavens
    To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
    But to confront the
 visage of offence?
    And what's in prayer but this twofold force,
    To be forestalled ere we 
come to fall,
    Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;
    My fault is past. But, O, what fo
rm of prayer
    Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murther'?
    That cannot be; since I am s
till possess'd
    Of those effects for which I did the murther-
    My crown, mine own ambition, 
and my queen.
    May one be pardon'd and retain th' offence?
    In the corrupted currents of thi
s world
    Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,
    And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize its
elf
    Buys out the law; but 'tis not so above.
    There is no shuffling; there the action lies

    In his true nature, and we ourselves compell'd,
    Even to the teeth and forehead of our faul
ts,
    To give in evidence. What then? What rests?
    Try what repentance can. What can it not?

    Yet what can it when one cannot repent?
    O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
    O l
imed soul, that, struggling to be free,
    Art more engag'd! Help, angels! Make assay.
    Bow, s
tubborn knees; and heart with strings of steel,
    Be soft as sinews of the new-born babe!
    Al
l may be well.                                  He kneels.

                         Enter Hamlet.


  Ham. Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
    And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heave
n,
    And so am I reveng'd. That would be scann'd.
    A villain kills my father; and for that,

    I, his sole son, do this same villain send
    To heaven.
    Why, this is hire and salary, no
t revenge!
    He took my father grossly, full of bread,
    With all his crimes broad blown, as f
lush as May;
    And how his audit stands, who knows save heaven?
    But in our circumstance and 
course of thought,
    'Tis heavy with him; and am I then reveng'd,
    To take him in the purging
 of his soul,
    When he is fit and seasoned for his passage?
    No.
    Up, sword, and know th
ou a more horrid hent.
    When he is drunk asleep; or in his rage;
    Or in th' incestuous pleas
ure of his bed;
    At gaming, swearing, or about some act
    That has no relish of salvation in'
t-
    Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,
    And that his soul may be as damn'd an
d black
    As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays.
    This physic but prolongs thy sickly day
s.              Exit.
  King. [rises] My words fly up, my thoughts remain below.
    Words without
 thoughts never to heaven go.             Exit.




Scene IV.
The Queen's closet.

Enter Que
en and Polonius.

  Pol. He will come straight. Look you lay home to him.
    Tell him his pranks
 have been too broad to bear with,
    And that your Grace hath screen'd and stood between
    Muc
h heat and him. I'll silence me even here.
    Pray you be round with him.
  Ham. (within) Mother,
 mother, mother!
  Queen. I'll warrant you; fear me not. Withdraw; I hear him
coming.
           
                   [Polonius hides behind the arras.]

                          Enter Hamlet.


  Ham. Now, mother, what's the matter?
  Queen. Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
  Ham.
 Mother, you have my father much offended.
  Queen. Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
  
Ham. Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
  Queen. Why, how now, Hamlet?
  Ham. What's the m
atter now?
  Queen. Have you forgot me?
  Ham. No, by the rood, not so!
    You are the Queen, yo
ur husband's brother's wife,
    And (would it were not so!) you are my mother.
  Queen. Nay, then
 I'll set those to you that can speak.
  Ham. Come, come, and sit you down. You shall not budge;
 
   You go not till I set you up a glass
    Where you may see the inmost part of you.
  Queen. Wha
t wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murther me?
    Help, help, ho!
  Pol. [behind] What, ho! help, help
, help!
  Ham. [draws] How now? a rat? Dead for a ducat, dead!
            [Makes a pass through t
he arras and] kills Polonius.
  Pol. [behind] O, I am slain!
  Queen. O me, what hast thou done?

  Ham. Nay, I know not. Is it the King?
  Queen. O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
  Ham. A 
bloody deed- almost as bad, good mother,
    As kill a king, and marry with his brother.
  Queen. 
As kill a king?
  Ham. Ay, lady, it was my word.
                         [Lifts up the arras and 
sees Polonius.]
    Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
    I took thee for thy better.
 Take thy fortune.
    Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.
    Leave wringing of your hand
s. Peace! sit you down
    And let me wring your heart; for so I shall
    If it be made of penetr
able stuff;
    If damned custom have not braz'd it so
    That it is proof and bulwark against se
nse.
  Queen. What have I done that thou dar'st wag thy tongue
    In noise so rude against me?
 
 Ham. Such an act
    That blurs the grace and blush of modesty;
    Calls virtue hypocrite; takes
 off the rose
    From the fair forehead of an innocent love,
    And sets a blister there; makes 
marriage vows
    As false as dicers' oaths. O, such a deed
    As from the body of contraction pl
ucks
    The very soul, and sweet religion makes
    A rhapsody of words! Heaven's face doth glow;

    Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
    With tristful visage, as against the doom,
    Is 
thought-sick at the act.
  Queen. Ah me, what act,
    That roars so loud and thunders in the inde
x?
  Ham. Look here upon th's picture, and on this,
    The counterfeit presentment of two brother
s.
    See what a grace was seated on this brow;
    Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;

    An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
    A station like the herald Mercury
    New ligh
ted on a heaven-kissing hill:
    A combination and a form indeed
    Where every god did seem to 
set his seal
    To give the world assurance of a man.
    This was your husband. Look you now wha
t follows.
    Here is your husband, like a mildew'd ear
    Blasting his wholesome brother. Have 
you eyes?
    Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
    And batten on this moor? Ha! have
 you eyes
    You cannot call it love; for at your age
    The heyday in the blood is tame, it's h
umble,
    And waits upon the judgment; and what judgment
    Would step from this to this? Sense 
sure you have,
    Else could you not have motion; but sure that sense
    Is apoplex'd; for madne
ss would not err,
    Nor sense to ecstacy was ne'er so thrall'd
    But it reserv'd some quantity
 of choice
    To serve in such a difference. What devil was't
    That thus hath cozen'd you at h
oodman-blind?
    Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
    Ears without hands or eyes, sme
lling sans all,
    Or but a sickly part of one true sense
    Could not so mope.
    O shame! wh
ere is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
    If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
    To flaming yo
uth let virtue be as wax
    And melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame
    When the compulsive a
rdour gives the charge,
    Since frost itself as actively doth burn,
    And reason panders will.

  Queen. O Hamlet, speak no more!
    Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul,
    And there I 
see such black and grained spots
    As will not leave their tinct.
  Ham. Nay, but to live
    I
n the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
    Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love
    Over t
he nasty sty!
  Queen. O, speak to me no more!
    These words like daggers enter in mine ears.
 
   No more, sweet Hamlet!
  Ham. A murtherer and a villain!
    A slave that is not twentieth part
 the tithe
    Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
    A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,

    That from a shelf the precious diadem stole
    And put it in his pocket!
  Queen. No more!


                Enter the Ghost in his nightgown.

  Ham. A king of shreds and patches!-
    S
ave me and hover o'er me with your wings,
    You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?

  Queen. Alas, he's mad!
  Ham. Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
    That, laps'd in tim
e and passion, lets go by
    Th' important acting of your dread command?
    O, say!
  Ghost. Do
 not forget. This visitation
    Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
    But look, amazemen
t on thy mother sits.
    O, step between her and her fighting soul
    Conceit in weakest bodies 
strongest works.
    Speak to her, Hamlet.
  Ham. How is it with you, lady?
  Queen. Alas, how is
't with you,
    That you do bend your eye on vacancy,
    And with th' encorporal air do hold dis
course?
    Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
    And, as the sleeping soldiers in th' 
alarm,
    Your bedded hairs, like life in excrements,
    Start up and stand an end. O gentle son
,
    Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
    Sprinkle cool patience! Whereon do you look?
 
 Ham. On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!
    His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to s
tones,
    Would make them capable.- Do not look upon me,
    Lest with this piteous action you co
nvert
    My stern effects. Then what I have to do
    Will want true colour- tears perchance for 
blood.
  Queen. To whom do you speak this?
  Ham. Do you see nothing there?
  Queen. Nothing at a
ll; yet all that is I see.
  Ham. Nor did you nothing hear?
  Queen. No, nothing but ourselves.
 
 Ham. Why, look you there! Look how it steals away!
    My father, in his habit as he liv'd!
    L
ook where he goes even now out at the portal!
                                                     
Exit Ghost.
  Queen. This is the very coinage of your brain.
    This bodiless creation ecstasy
 
   Is very cunning in.
  Ham. Ecstasy?
    My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time
    And m
akes as healthful music. It is not madness
    That I have utt'red. Bring me to the test,
    And 
I the matter will reword; which madness
    Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
    Lay 
not that flattering unction to your soul
    That not your trespass but my madness speaks.
    It 
will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
    Whiles rank corruption, mining all within,
    Infe
cts unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
    Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
    And do 
not spread the compost on the weeds
    To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;
    For in
 the fatness of these pursy times
    Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg-
    Yea, curb and woo
 for leave to do him good.
  Queen. O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
  Ham. O, throw a
way the worser part of it,
    And live the purer with the other half,
    Good night- but go not 
to my uncle's bed.
    Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
    That monster, custom, who all sens
e doth eat
    Of habits evil, is angel yet in this,
    That to the use of actions fair and good

    He likewise gives a frock or livery,
    That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,
    And that
 shall lend a kind of easiness
    To the next abstinence; the next more easy;
    For use almost 
can change the stamp of nature,
    And either [master] the devil, or throw him out
    With wondr
ous potency. Once more, good night;
    And when you are desirous to be blest,
    I'll blessing b
eg of you.- For this same lord,
    I do repent; but heaven hath pleas'd it so,
    To punish me w
ith this, and this with me,
    That I must be their scourge and minister.
    I will bestow him, 
and will answer well
    The death I gave him. So again, good night.
    I must be cruel, only to 
be kind;
    Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.
    One word more, good lady.
  Queen. Wh
at shall I do?
  Ham. Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
    Let the bloat King tempt you a
gain to bed;
    Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
    And let him, for a pair of re
echy kisses,
    Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,
    Make you to ravel all this 
matter out,
    That I essentially am not in madness,
    But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let hi
m know;
    For who that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
    Would from a paddock, from a bat, a
 gib
    Such dear concernings hide? Who would do so?
    No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
  
  Unpeg the basket on the house's top,
    Let the birds fly, and like the famous ape,
    To try 
conclusions, in the basket creep
    And break your own neck down.
  Queen. Be thou assur'd, if wo
rds be made of breath,
    And breath of life, I have no life to breathe
    What thou hast said t
o me.
  Ham. I must to England; you know that?
  Queen. Alack,
    I had forgot! 'Tis so conclude
d on.
  Ham. There's letters seal'd; and my two schoolfellows,
    Whom I will trust as I will add
ers fang'd,
    They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way
    And marshal me to knavery. Let i
t work;
    For 'tis the sport to have the enginer
    Hoist with his own petar; and 't shall go h
ard
    But I will delve one yard below their mines
    And blow them at the moon. O, 'tis most sw

    When in one line two crafts directly meet.
    This man shall set me packing.
    I'll lu

    Mother, good night.- Indeed, this counsellor
    Is now m

    Who was in life a foolish peating knave.
    Come, sir
, to draw toward an end with you.
    Good night, mother.
                  [Exit the Queen. Then]
 Exit Hamlet, tugging in
                                                       Polonius.

ACT IV. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King and Queen, with Rosencra
ntz and Guildenstern.

  King. There's matter in these sighs. These profound heaves
    You must 
translate; 'tis fit we understand them.
    Where is your son?
  Queen. Bestow this place on us a 
little while.
                          [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
    Ah, mine own lo
rd, what have I seen to-night!
  King. What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
  Queen. Mad as the sea an
d wind when both contend
    Which is the mightier. In his lawless fit
    Behind the arras hearin
g something stir,
    Whips out his rapier, cries 'A rat, a rat!'
    And in this brainish apprehe
nsion kills
    The unseen good old man.
  King. O heavy deed!
    It had been so with us, had we
 been there.
    His liberty is full of threats to all-
    To you yourself, to us, to every one.

    Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
    It will be laid to us, whose providence
   
 Should have kept short, restrain'd, and out of haunt
    This mad young man. But so much was our l
ove
    We would not understand what was most fit,
    But, like the owner of a foul disease,
   
 To keep it from divulging, let it feed
    Even on the pith of life. Where is he gone?
  Queen. T
o draw apart the body he hath kill'd;
    O'er whom his very madness, like some ore
    Among a mi
neral of metals base,
    Shows itself pure. He weeps for what is done.
  King. O Gertrude, come a
way!
    The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch
    But we will ship him hence; and this vile
 deed
    We must with all our majesty and skill
    Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern
!

             Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

    Friends both, go join you with some fur
ther aid.
    Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
    And from his mother's closet hath he drag
g'd him.
    Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body
    Into the chapel. I pray you haste
 in this.
                          Exeunt [Rosencrantz and Guildenstern].
    Come, Gertrude, we'
ll call up our wisest friends
    And let them know both what we mean to do
    And what's untimel
y done. [So haply slander-]
    Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter,
    As level as the canno
n to his blank,
    Transports his poisoned shot- may miss our name
    And hit the woundless air.
- O, come away!
    My soul is full of discord and dismay.
                                       
                  Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A passage in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet.


  Ham. Safely stow'd.
  Gentlemen. (within) Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!
  Ham. But soft! What noise? Who
 calls on Hamlet? O, here they
come.

               Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Ros
. What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
  Ham. Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin
.
  Ros. Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
    And bear it to the chapel.
  Ham. Do 
not believe it.
  Ros. Believe what?
  Ham. That I can keep your counsel, and not mine own. Beside
s,
to be
    demanded of a sponge, what replication should be made by the
son
    of a king?
  
Ros. Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
  Ham. Ay, sir; that soaks up the King's countenance, his

rewards,
    his authorities. But such officers do the King best service
in
    the end. He keeps
 them, like an ape, in the corner of his
jaw;
    first mouth'd, to be last swallowed. When he nee
ds what you
have
    glean'd, it is but squeezing you and, sponge, you shall be
dry
    again.

  Ros. I understand you not, my lord.
  Ham. I am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish 
ear.
  Ros. My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us
to
    the King.
  Ham. T
he body is with the King, but the King is not with the
body.
    The King is a thing-
  Guil. A t
hing, my lord?
  Ham. Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.
                      
                                   Exeunt.




Scene III.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

E
nter King.

  King. I have sent to seek him and to find the body.
    How dangerous is it that th
is man goes loose!
    Yet must not we put the strong law on him.
    He's lov'd of the distracted
 multitude,
    Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;
    And where 'tis so, th' offende
r's scourge is weigh'd,
    But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,
    This sudden se
nding him away must seem
    Deliberate pause. Diseases desperate grown
    By desperate appliance
 are reliev'd,
    Or not at all.

                    Enter Rosencrantz.

    How now O What h
ath befall'n?
  Ros. Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
    We cannot get from him.
  King
. But where is he?
  Ros. Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
  King. Bring him befo
re us.
  Ros. Ho, Guildenstern! Bring in my lord.

        Enter Hamlet and Guildenstern [with At
tendants].

  King. Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
  Ham. At supper.
  King. At supper? Where?

  Ham. Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A certain
    convocation of politic worms are e'e
n at him. Your worm is
your
    only emperor for diet. We fat all creatures else to fat us,
and

    we fat ourselves for maggots. Your fat king and your lean
beggar
    is but variable service- 
two dishes, but to one table. That's
the
    end.
  King. Alas, alas!
  Ham. A man may fish with
 the worm that hath eat of a king, and
eat
    of the fish that hath fed of that worm.
  King. Wh
at dost thou mean by this?
  Ham. Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress
through
  
  the guts of a beggar.
  King. Where is Polonius?
  Ham. In heaven. Send thither to see. If your 
messenger find him
not
    there, seek him i' th' other place yourself. But indeed, if
you
    f
ind him not within this month, you shall nose him as you go
up
    the stair, into the lobby.
  K
ing. Go seek him there. [To Attendants.]
  Ham. He will stay till you come.
                      
                      [Exeunt Attendants.]
  King. Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,-

    Which we do tender as we dearly grieve
    For that which thou hast done,- must send thee hence

    With fiery quickness. Therefore prepare thyself.
    The bark is ready and the wind at help,

    Th' associates tend, and everything is bent
    For England.
  Ham. For England?
  King. Ay,
 Hamlet.
  Ham. Good.
  King. So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
  Ham. I see a cherub that 
sees them. But come, for England!
    Farewell, dear mother.
  King. Thy loving father, Hamlet.
 
 Ham. My mother! Father and mother is man and wife; man and wife
is
    one flesh; and so, my moth
er. Come, for England!
Exit.
  King. Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard.
    Delay i
t not; I'll have him hence to-night.
    Away! for everything is seal'd and done
    That else lea
ns on th' affair. Pray you make haste.
                            Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenst
ern]
    And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught,-
    As my great power thereof may give t
hee sense,
    Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
    After the Danish sword, and thy free 
awe
    Pays homage to us,- thou mayst not coldly set
    Our sovereign process, which imports at 
full,
    By letters congruing to that effect,
    The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;
 
   For like the hectic in my blood he rages,
    And thou must cure me. Till I know 'tis done,
   
 Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.             Exit.

Scene IV.
Near E
lsinore.

Enter Fortinbras with his Army over the stage.

  For. Go, Captain, from me greet the 
Danish king.
    Tell him that by his license Fortinbras
    Craves the conveyance of a promis'd m
arch
    Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.
    If that his Majesty would aught with us,

    We shall express our duty in his eye;
    And let him know so.
  Capt. I will do't, my lord.

  For. Go softly on.
                                   Exeunt [all but the Captain].

       Ent
er Hamlet, Rosencrantz, [Guildenstern,] and others.

  Ham. Good sir, whose powers are these?
  C
apt. They are of Norway, sir.
  Ham. How purpos'd, sir, I pray you?
  Capt. Against some part of P
oland.
  Ham. Who commands them, sir?
  Capt. The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.
  Ham. Goes i
t against the main of Poland, sir,
    Or for some frontier?
  Capt. Truly to speak, and with no a
ddition,
    We go to gain a little patch of ground
    That hath in it no profit but the name.
 
   To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
    Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
    
A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
  Ham. Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
  Capt.
 Yes, it is already garrison'd.
  Ham. Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
    Will not 
debate the question of this straw.
    This is th' imposthume of much wealth and peace,
    That i
nward breaks, and shows no cause without
    Why the man dies.- I humbly thank you, sir.
  Capt. G
od b' wi' you, sir.                             [Exit.]
  Ros. Will't please you go, my lord?
  Ha
m. I'll be with you straight. Go a little before.
                                        [Exeunt a
ll but Hamlet.]
    How all occasions do inform against me
    And spur my dull revenge! What is a
 man,
    If his chief good and market of his time
    Be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.

    Sure he that made us with such large discourse,
    Looking before and after, gave us not
  
  That capability and godlike reason
    To fust in us unus'd. Now, whether it be
    Bestial obli
vion, or some craven scruple
    Of thinking too precisely on th' event,-
    A thought which, qua
rter'd, hath but one part wisdom
    And ever three parts coward,- I do not know
    Why yet I liv
e to say 'This thing's to do,'
    Sith I have cause, and will, and strength, and means
    To do'
t. Examples gross as earth exhort me.
    Witness this army of such mass and charge,
    Led by a 
delicate and tender prince,
    Whose spirit, with divine ambition puff'd,
    Makes mouths at the
 invisible event,
    Exposing what is mortal and unsure
    To all that fortune, death, and dange
r dare,
    Even for an eggshell. Rightly to be great
    Is not to stir without great argument,

    But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
    When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,
    T
hat have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,
    Excitements of my reason and my blood,
    And let
 all sleep, while to my shame I see
    The imminent death of twenty thousand men
    That for a f
antasy and trick of fame
    Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot
    Whereon the number
s cannot try the cause,
    Which is not tomb enough and continent
    To hide the slain? O, from 
this time forth,
    My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!            Exit.

Scene V.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter Horatio, Queen, and a Gentleman.

  Queen. 
I will not speak with her.
  Gent. She is importunate, indeed distract.
    Her mood will needs be
 pitied.
  Queen. What would she have?
  Gent. She speaks much of her father; says she hears
    
There's tricks i' th' world, and hems, and beats her heart;
    Spurns enviously at straws; speaks 
things in doubt,
    That carry but half sense. Her speech is nothing,
    Yet the unshaped use of
 it doth move
    The hearers to collection; they aim at it,
    And botch the words up fit to the
ir own thoughts;
    Which, as her winks and nods and gestures yield them,
    Indeed would make o
ne think there might be thought,
    Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
  Hor. 'Twere good s
he were spoken with; for she may strew
    Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.
  Queen. L
et her come in.
                                               [Exit Gentleman.]
    [Aside] To my
 sick soul (as sin's true nature is)
    Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
    So full 
of artless jealousy is guilt
    It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.

                 Enter
 Ophelia distracted.

  Oph. Where is the beauteous Majesty of Denmark?
  Queen. How now, Ophelia
?
  Oph. (sings)
         How should I your true-love know
           From another one?
        
 By his cockle bat and' staff
           And his sandal shoon.

  Queen. Alas, sweet lady, what i
mports this song?
  Oph. Say you? Nay, pray You mark.

    (Sings) He is dead and gone, lady,
  
            He is dead and gone;
            At his head a grass-green turf,
              At his 
heels a stone.

    O, ho!
  Queen. Nay, but Ophelia-
  Oph. Pray you mark.

    (Sings) White
 his shroud as the mountain snow-

                    Enter King.

  Queen. Alas, look here, my
 lord!
  Oph. (Sings)
           Larded all with sweet flowers;
         Which bewept to the grav
e did not go
           With true-love showers.

  King. How do you, pretty lady?
  Oph. Well, G
od dild you! They say the owl was a baker's
daughter.
    Lord, we know what we are, but know not 
what we may be. God
be at
    your table!
  King. Conceit upon her father.
  Oph. Pray let's hav
e no words of this; but when they ask, you
what
    it means, say you this:

    (Sings) To-morr
ow is Saint Valentine's day,
              All in the morning bedtime,
            And I a maid at
 your window,
              To be your Valentine.

            Then up he rose and donn'd his clo
'es
              And dupp'd the chamber door,
            Let in the maid, that out a maid
     
         Never departed more.

  King. Pretty Ophelia!
  Oph. Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll m
ake an end on't!

    [Sings] By Gis and by Saint Charity,
              Alack, and fie for shame
!
            Young men will do't if they come to't
              By Cock, they are to blame.

 
           Quoth she, 'Before you tumbled me,
              You promis'd me to wed.'

    He answ
ers:

            'So would I 'a' done, by yonder sun,
              An thou hadst not come to my
 bed.'

  King. How long hath she been thus?
  Oph. I hope all will be well. We must be patient; 
but I cannot
    choose but weep to think they would lay him i' th' cold
ground.
    My brother s
hall know of it; and so I thank you for your good
    counsel. Come, my coach! Good night, ladies. 
Good night,
sweet
    ladies. Good night, good night.                         Exit
  King. Follow
 her close; give her good watch, I pray you.
                                                 [Exit
 Horatio.]

    O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs
    All from her father's death. 
O Gertrude, Gertrude,
    When sorrows come, they come not single spies.
    But in battalions! Fi
rst, her father slain;
    Next, your son gone, and he most violent author
    Of his own just rem
ove; the people muddied,
    Thick and and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers
    For good
 Polonius' death, and we have done but greenly
    In hugger-mugger to inter him; poor Ophelia
   
 Divided from herself and her fair judgment,
    Without the which we are pictures or mere beasts;

    Last, and as much containing as all these,
    Her brother is in secret come from France;
   
 And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
    Feeds on his wonder, keep, himself in clouds,
    Wit
h pestilent speeches of his father's death,
    Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
    Will no
thing stick our person to arraign
    In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
    Like to a murd
'ring piece, in many places
    Give me superfluous death.                  A noise within.
  Quee
n. Alack, what noise is this?
  King. Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.

          
           Enter a Messenger.

    What is the matter?
  Mess. Save Yourself, my lord:
    The o
cean, overpeering of his list,
    Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
    Than Young Lae
rtes, in a riotous head,
    O'erbears Your offices. The rabble call him lord;
    And, as the wor
ld were now but to begin,
    Antiquity forgot, custom not known,
    The ratifiers and props of e
very word,
    They cry 'Choose we! Laertes shall be king!'
    Caps, hands, and tongues applaud i
t to the clouds,
    'Laertes shall be king! Laertes king!'
                                      
           A noise within.
  Queen. How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!
    O, this is cou
nter, you false Danish dogs!
  King. The doors are broke.

                    Enter Laertes with
 others.

  Laer. Where is this king?- Sirs, staid you all without.
  All. No, let's come in!
  
Laer. I pray you give me leave.
  All. We will, we will!
  Laer. I thank you. Keep the door.      
[Exeunt his Followers.]
    O thou vile king,
    Give me my father!
  Queen. Calmly, good Laerte
s.
  Laer. That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard;
    Cries cuckold to my father; br
ands the harlot
    Even here between the chaste unsmirched brows
    Of my true mother.
  King. 
What is the cause, Laertes,
    That thy rebellion looks so giantlike?
    Let him go, Gertrude. D
o not fear our person.
    There's such divinity doth hedge a king
    That treason can but peep t
o what it would,
    Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,
    Why thou art thus incens'd. Le
t him go, Gertrude.
    Speak, man.
  Laer. Where is my father?
  King. Dead.
  Queen. But not b
y him!
  King. Let him demand his fill.
  Laer. How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
    T
o hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil
    Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!

    I dare damnation. To this point I stand,
    That both the world, I give to negligence,
    Le
t come what comes; only I'll be reveng'd
    Most throughly for my father.
  King. Who shall stay 
you?
  Laer. My will, not all the world!
    And for my means, I'll husband them so well
    They
 shall go far with little.
  King. Good Laertes,
    If you desire to know the certainty
    Of y
our dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge
    That sweepstake you will draw both friend an
d foe,
    Winner and loser?
  Laer. None but his enemies.
  King. Will you know them then?
  La
er. To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms
    And, like the kind life-rend'ring pelican,

    Repast them with my blood.
  King. Why, now You speak
    Like a good child and a true gentlem
an.
    That I am guiltless of your father's death,
    And am most sensibly in grief for it,
   
 It shall as level to your judgment pierce
    As day does to your eye.
                          
    A noise within: 'Let her come in.'
  Laer. How now? What noise is that?

                    
  Enter Ophelia.

    O heat, dry up my brains! Tears seven times salt
    Burn out the sense and
 virtue of mine eye!
    By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight
    Till our scale turn th
e beam. O rose of May!
    Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
    O heavens! is't possible a y
oung maid's wits
    Should be as mortal as an old man's life?
    Nature is fine in love, and whe
re 'tis fine,
    It sends some precious instance of itself
    After the thing it loves.

  Oph
. (sings)
         They bore him barefac'd on the bier
           (Hey non nony, nony, hey nony)

         And in his grave rain'd many a tear.

    Fare you well, my dove!
  Laer. Hadst thou thy
 wits, and didst persuade revenge,
    It could not move thus.
  Oph. You must sing 'A-down a-down
, and you call him a-down-a.'
O,
    how the wheel becomes it! It is the false steward, that stole

his
    master's daughter.
  Laer. This nothing's more than matter.
  Oph. There's rosemary, th
at's for remembrance. Pray you, love,
    remember. And there is pansies, that's for thoughts.
  L
aer. A document in madness! Thoughts and remembrance fitted.
  Oph. There's fennel for you, and col
umbines. There's rue for
you,
    and here's some for me. We may call it herb of grace o'
Sundays
.
    O, you must wear your rue with a difference! There's a daisy.
I
    would give you some vio
lets, but they wither'd all when my
father
    died. They say he made a good end.

    [Sings] F
or bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.

  Laer. Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,
    Sh
e turns to favour and to prettiness.
  Oph. (sings)
         And will he not come again?
        
 And will he not come again?
           No, no, he is dead;
           Go to thy deathbed;
      
   He never will come again.

         His beard was as white as snow,
         All flaxen was hi
s poll.
           He is gone, he is gone,
           And we cast away moan.
         God 'a'merc
y on his soul!

    And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God b' wi' you.
Exit.
  Laer. Do you
 see this, O God?
  King. Laertes, I must commune with your grief,
    Or you deny me right. Go bu
t apart,
    Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will,
    And they shall hear and judge '
twixt you and me.
    If by direct or by collateral hand
    They find us touch'd, we will our kin
gdom give,
    Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours,
    To you in satisfaction; but if 
not,
    Be you content to lend your patience to us,
    And we shall jointly labour with your sou
l
    To give it due content.
  Laer. Let this be so.
    His means of death, his obscure funeral
-
    No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,
    No noble rite nor formal ostentation,-

    Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
    That I must call't in question.
  King. S
o you shall;
    And where th' offence is let the great axe fall.
    I pray you go with me.
    
                                                      Exeunt

Scene VI.
Elsinor
e. Another room in the Castle.

Enter Horatio with an Attendant.

  Hor. What are they that woul
d speak with me?
  Servant. Seafaring men, sir. They say they have letters for
you.
  Hor. Let th
em come in.
                                               [Exit Attendant.]
    I do not know fro
m what part of the world
    I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.

                     
     Enter Sailors.

  Sailor. God bless you, sir.
  Hor. Let him bless thee too.
  Sailor. 'A s
hall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter for
you,
    sir,- it comes from th' ambassador that 
was bound for
England- if
    your name be Horatio, as I am let to know it is.
  Hor. (reads the 
letter) 'Horatio, when thou shalt have
overlook'd
    this, give these fellows some means to the K
ing. They have
    letters for him. Ere we were two days old at sea, a pirate of

    very warlik
e appointment gave us chase. Finding ourselves too
    slow of sail, we put on a compelled valour, 
and in the
grapple I
    boarded them. On the instant they got clear of our ship; so I
    alone 
became their prisoner. They have dealt with me like
thieves
    of mercy; but they knew what they 
did: I am to do a good turn
for
    them. Let the King have the letters I have sent, and repair
t
hou
    to me with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death. I have
words
    to speak in thine ea
r will make thee dumb; yet are they much
too
    light for the bore of the matter. These good fell

bring
    thee where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their
course
    for Engla

                            'He that thou knowest t
hine, HAMLET.'

    Come, I will give you way for these your letters,
    And do't the speedier t
hat you may direct me
    To him from whom you brought them.                   Exeunt.

Scene VII.
Elsinore. Another room in the Castle.

Enter King and Laertes.

  King. Now
 must your conscience my acquittance seal,
    And You must put me in your heart for friend,
    S
ith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
    That he which hath your noble father slain
    Pur
sued my life.
  Laer. It well appears. But tell me
    Why you proceeded not against these feats

    So crimeful and so capital in nature,
    As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
    You 
mainly were stirr'd up.
  King. O, for two special reasons,
    Which may to you, perhaps, seem mu
ch unsinew'd,
    But yet to me they are strong. The Queen his mother
    Lives almost by his look
s; and for myself,-
    My virtue or my plague, be it either which,-
    She's so conjunctive to m
y life and soul
    That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
    I could not but by her. The
 other motive
    Why to a public count I might not go
    Is the great love the general gender be
ar him,
    Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
    Would, like the spring that turnet
h wood to stone,
    Convert his gives to graces; so that my arrows,
    Too slightly timber'd for
 so loud a wind,
    Would have reverted to my bow again,
    And not where I had aim'd them.
  L
aer. And so have I a noble father lost;
    A sister driven into desp'rate terms,
    Whose worth,
 if praises may go back again,
    Stood challenger on mount of all the age
    For her perfection
s. But my revenge will come.
  King. Break not your sleeps for that. You must not think
    That w
e are made of stuff so flat and dull
    That we can let our beard be shook with danger,
    And t
hink it pastime. You shortly shall hear more.
    I lov'd your father, and we love ourself,
    An
d that, I hope, will teach you to imagine-

                 Enter a Messenger with letters.

  
  How now? What news?
  Mess. Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:
    This to your Majesty; this to the
 Queen.
  King. From Hamlet? Who brought them?
  Mess. Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not.

    They were given me by Claudio; he receiv'd them
    Of him that brought them.
  King. Laerte
s, you shall hear them.
    Leave us.
                                                 Exit Messen
ger.
    [Reads]'High and Mighty,-You shall know I am set naked on
your
    kingdom. To-morrow sh
all I beg leave to see your kingly eyes;
    when I shall (first asking your pardon thereunto) reco
unt the
    occasion of my sudden and more strange return.
                                       
              'HAMLET.'
    What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?
    Or is it some a
buse, and no such thing?
  Laer. Know you the hand?
  King. 'Tis Hamlet's character. 'Naked!'
   
 And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'
    Can you advise me?
  Laer. I am lost in it, my lor
d. But let him come!
    It warms the very sickness in my heart
    That I shall live and tell him
 to his teeth,
    'Thus didest thou.'
  King. If it be so, Laertes
    (As how should it be so? 
how otherwise?),
    Will you be rul'd by me?
  Laer. Ay my lord,
    So you will not o'errule me
 to a peace.
  King. To thine own peace. If he be now return'd
    As checking at his voyage, and 
that he means
    No more to undertake it, I will work him
    To exploit now ripe in my device,

    Under the which he shall not choose but fall;
    And for his death no wind shall breathe
    
But even his mother shall uncharge the practice
    And call it accident.
  Laer. My lord, I will 
be rul'd;
    The rather, if you could devise it so
    That I might be the organ.
  King. It fal
ls right.
    You have been talk'd of since your travel much,
    And that in Hamlet's hearing, fo
r a quality
    Wherein they say you shine, Your sum of parts
    Did not together pluck such envy
 from him
    As did that one; and that, in my regard,
    Of the unworthiest siege.
  Laer. What
 part is that, my lord?
  King. A very riband in the cap of youth-
    Yet needfull too; for youth
 no less becomes
    The light and careless livery that it wears
    Than settled age his sables a
nd his weeds,
    Importing health and graveness. Two months since
    Here was a gentleman of Nor
mandy.
    I have seen myself, and serv'd against, the French,
    And they can well on horseback;
 but this gallant
    Had witchcraft in't. He grew unto his seat,
    And to such wondrous doing b
rought his horse
    As had he been incorps'd and demi-natur'd
    With the brave beast. So far he
 topp'd my thought
    That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
    Come short of what he did.
  
Laer. A Norman was't?
  King. A Norman.
  Laer. Upon my life, Lamound.
  King. The very same.
  
Laer. I know him well. He is the broach indeed
    And gem of all the nation.
  King. He made conf
ession of you;
    And gave you such a masterly report
    For art and exercise in your defence,

    And for your rapier most especially,
    That he cried out 'twould be a sight indeed
    If on
e could match you. The scrimers of their nation
    He swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
 
   If you oppos'd them. Sir, this report of his
    Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
    That h
e could nothing do but wish and beg
    Your sudden coming o'er to play with you.
    Now, out of 
this-
  Laer. What out of this, my lord?
  King. Laertes, was your father dear to you?
    Or are
 you like the painting of a sorrow,
    A face without a heart,'
  Laer. Why ask you this?
  King
. Not that I think you did not love your father;
    But that I know love is begun by time,
    An
d that I see, in passages of proof,
    Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
    There lives w
ithin the very flame of love
    A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
    And nothing is at
 a like goodness still;
    For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
    Dies in his own too-much. That
 we would do,
    We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes,
    And hath abatements an
d delays as many
    As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
    And then this 'should' is
 like a spendthrift sigh,
    That hurts by easing. But to the quick o' th' ulcer!
    Hamlet come
s back. What would you undertake
    To show yourself your father's son in deed
    More than in w
ords?
  Laer. To cut his throat i' th' church!
  King. No place indeed should murther sanctuarize;

    Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,
    Will you do this? Keep close within you
r chamber.
    Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home.
    We'll put on those shall praise y
our excellence
    And set a double varnish on the fame
    The Frenchman gave you; bring you in f
ine together
    And wager on your heads. He, being remiss,
    Most generous, and free from all c
ontriving,
    Will not peruse the foils; so that with ease,
    Or with a little shuffling, you m
ay choose
    A sword unbated, and, in a pass of practice,
    Requite him for your father.
  Lae
r. I will do't!
    And for that purpose I'll anoint my sword.
    I bought an unction of a mounte
bank,
    So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
    Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
 
   Collected from all simples that have virtue
    Under the moon, can save the thing from death
 
   This is but scratch'd withal. I'll touch my point
    With this contagion, that, if I gall him s
lightly,
    It may be death.
  King. Let's further think of this,
    Weigh what convenience bot
h of time and means
    May fit us to our shape. If this should fall,
    And that our drift look 
through our bad performance.
    'Twere better not assay'd. Therefore this project
    Should have
 a back or second, that might hold
    If this did blast in proof. Soft! let me see.
    We'll mak
e a solemn wager on your cunnings-
    I ha't!
    When in your motion you are hot and dry-
    A
s make your bouts more violent to that end-
    And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepar'd him

    A chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,
    If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,

    Our purpose may hold there.- But stay, what noise,

                           Enter Queen.


    How now, sweet queen?
  Queen. One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
    So fast they foll
ow. Your sister's drown'd, Laertes.
  Laer. Drown'd! O, where?
  Queen. There is a willow grows as
lant a brook,
    That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream.
    There with fantastic garlan
ds did she come
    Of crowflowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,
    That liberal shepherds
 give a grosser name,
    But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them.
    There on the pen
dant boughs her coronet weeds
    Clamb'ring to hang, an envious sliver broke,
    When down her w
eedy trophies and herself
    Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide
    And, mermaid-
like, awhile they bore her up;
    Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes,
    As one incap
able of her own distress,
    Or like a creature native and indued
    Unto that element; but long
 it could not be
    Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
    Pull'd the poor wretch fr
om her melodious lay
    To muddy death.
  Laer. Alas, then she is drown'd?
  Queen. Drown'd, dro
wn'd.
  Laer. Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
    And therefore I forbid my tears; but 
yet
    It is our trick; nature her custom holds,
    Let shame say what it will. When these are g
one,
    The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord.
    I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze

    But that this folly douts it.                          Exit.
  King. Let's follow, Gertrude.

    How much I had to do to calm his rage I
    Now fear I this will give it start again;
    The
refore let's follow.
                                                         Exeunt.

ACT V. Scene I.
Elsinore. A churchyard.

Enter two Clowns, [with spades and pickaxes].


  Clown. Is she to be buried in Christian burial when she
wilfully
    seeks her own salvation?

  Other. I tell thee she is; therefore make her grave straight.
    The crowner hath sate on her, a
nd finds it Christian burial.
  Clown. How can that be, unless she drown'd herself in her own
    
defence?
  Other. Why, 'tis found so.
  Clown. It must be se offendendo; it cannot be else. For he
re
lies
    the point: if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act; and
an
    act hath three 
branches-it is to act, to do, and to perform;
    argal, she drown'd herself wittingly.
  Other. N
ay, but hear you, Goodman Delver!
  Clown. Give me leave. Here lies the water; good. Here stands
t
he
    man; good. If the man go to this water and drown himself, it
is,
    will he nill he, he g
oes- mark you that. But if the water
come to
    him and drown him, he drowns not himself. Argal, 
he that is
not
    guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.
  Other. But is this law?

  Clown. Ay, marry, is't- crowner's quest law.
  Other. Will you ha' the truth an't? If this had no
t been a
    gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o' Christian
burial.
  Clown. Why, ther
e thou say'st! And the more pity that great
folk
    should have count'nance in this world to drow
n or hang
themselves
    more than their even-Christian. Come, my spade! There is no
    ancient 
gentlemen but gard'ners, ditchers, and grave-makers.
They
    hold up Adam's profession.
  Other.
 Was he a gentleman?
  Clown. 'A was the first that ever bore arms.
  Other. Why, he had none.
  
Clown. What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the
Scripture?
    The Scripture says Adam di
gg'd. Could he dig without arms?
I'll
    put another question to thee. If thou answerest me not t
o the
    purpose, confess thyself-
  Other. Go to!
  Clown. What is he that builds stronger than
 either the mason,
the
    shipwright, or the carpenter?
  Other. The gallows-maker; for that fra
me outlives a thousand
    tenants.
  Clown. I like thy wit well, in good faith. The gallows does

well.
    But how does it well? It does well to those that do ill. Now,
    thou dost ill to say 
the gallows is built stronger than the
    church. Argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To't aga
in,
come!
  Other. Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a
    carpenter?
  Clown. 
Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
  Other. Marry, now I can tell!
  Clown. To't.
  Other. Mass, I can
not tell.

                 Enter Hamlet and Horatio afar off.

  Clown. Cudgel thy brains no mo
re about it, for your dull ass
will
    not mend his pace with beating; and when you are ask'd thi
s
    question next, say 'a grave-maker.' The houses he makes lasts
    till doomsday. Go, get the
e to Yaughan; fetch me a stoup of
    liquor.
                                            [Exit Se
cond Clown.]


                       [Clown digs and] sings.

       In youth when I did love,
 did love,
         Methought it was very sweet;
       To contract- O- the time for- a- my behove
,
         O, methought there- a- was nothing- a- meet.

  Ham. Has this fellow no feeling of his
 business, that he sings
at
    grave-making?
  Hor. Custom hath made it in him a property of eas
iness.
  Ham. 'Tis e'en so. The hand of little employment hath the
daintier
    sense.
  Clown. 
(sings)
         But age with his stealing steps
           Hath clawed me in his clutch,
       
  And hath shipped me intil the land,
           As if I had never been such.
                    
                        [Throws up a skull.]

  Ham. That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing
 once. How
the
    knave jowls it to the ground,as if 'twere Cain's jawbone,
that
    did the fi
rst murther! This might be the pate of a
Politician,
    which this ass now o'erreaches; one that 
would circumvent
God,
    might it not?
  Hor. It might, my lord.
  Ham. Or of a courtier, which
 could say 'Good morrow, sweet
lord!
    How dost thou, good lord?' This might be my Lord Such-a-o
ne,
that
    prais'd my Lord Such-a-one's horse when he meant to beg it-
might
    it not?
  Ho
r. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Why, e'en so! and now my Lady Worm's, chapless, and
knock'd
    about the 
mazzard with a sexton's spade. Here's fine
revolution,
    and we had the trick to see't. Did thes
e bones cost no more
the
    breeding but to play at loggets with 'em? Mine ache to think
    on'
t.
  Clown. (Sings)
         A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,
           For and a shrouding sheet
;
         O, a Pit of clay for to be made
           For such a guest is meet.
                 
                     Throws up [another skull].

  Ham. There's another. Why may not that be the s
kull of a
lawyer?
    Where be his quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, his
tenures,
    and h
is tricks? Why does he suffer this rude knave now to
knock
    him about the sconce with a dirty s
hovel, and will not tell
him
    of his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be in's time
a

    great buyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizances,
his
    fines, his double vouchers
, his recoveries. Is this the fine
of
    his fines, and the recovery of his recoveries, to have h
is
fine
    pate full of fine dirt? Will his vouchers vouch him no more
of
    his purchases, an
d double ones too, than the length and
breadth
    of a pair of indentures? The very conveyances o
f his lands
will
    scarcely lie in this box; and must th' inheritor himself have
no
    more, 
ha?
  Hor. Not a jot more, my lord.
  Ham. Is not parchment made of sheepskins?
  Hor. Ay, my lor
d, And of calveskins too.
  Ham. They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in
that. I
  
  will speak to this fellow. Whose grave's this, sirrah?
  Clown. Mine, sir.

    [Sings] O, a pi
t of clay for to be made
              For such a guest is meet.

  Ham. I think it be thine inde
ed, for thou liest in't.
  Clown. You lie out on't, sir, and therefore 'tis not yours.
    For my 
part, I do not lie in't, yet it is mine.
  Ham. Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine.
 'Tis
for
    the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.
  Clown. 'Tis a quick lie, sir; 
'twill away again from me to you.
  Ham. What man dost thou dig it for?
  Clown. For no man, sir.

  Ham. What woman then?
  Clown. For none neither.
  Ham. Who is to be buried in't?
  Clown. One
 that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's
dead.
  Ham. How absolute the knave is! We must 
speak by the card, or
    equivocation will undo us. By the Lord, Horatio, this three
years
    I
 have taken note of it, the age is grown so picked that the
toe
    of the peasant comes so near t
he heel of the courtier he
galls
    his kibe.- How long hast thou been a grave-maker?
  Clown. O
f all the days i' th' year, I came to't that day that
our
    last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras
.
  Ham. How long is that since?
  Clown. Cannot you tell that? Every fool can tell that. It was

the
    very day that young Hamlet was born- he that is mad, and sent
    into England.
  Ham. Ay
, marry, why was be sent into England?
  Clown. Why, because 'a was mad. 'A shall recover his wits

there;
    or, if 'a do not, 'tis no great matter there.
  Ham. Why?
  Clown. 'Twill not he seen
 in him there. There the men are as
mad as
    he.
  Ham. How came he mad?
  Clown. Very strange
ly, they say.
  Ham. How strangely?
  Clown. Faith, e'en with losing his wits.
  Ham. Upon what g
round?
  Clown. Why, here in Denmark. I have been sexton here, man and
boy
    thirty years.
  H
am. How long will a man lie i' th' earth ere he rot?
  Clown. Faith, if 'a be not rotten before 'a 
die (as we have
many
    pocky corses now-a-days that will scarce hold the laying in,
I
    will
 last you some eight year or nine year. A tanner will
last
    you nine year.
  Ham. Why he more 
than another?
  Clown. Why, sir, his hide is so tann'd with his trade that 'a
will
    keep out w
ater a great while; and your water is a sore
decayer of
    your whoreson dead body. Here's a skul
l now. This skull hath
lien
    you i' th' earth three-and-twenty years.
  Ham. Whose was it?
  
Clown. A whoreson, mad fellow's it was. Whose do you think it
was?
  Ham. Nay, I know not.
  Clow
n. A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! 'A pour'd a flagon
of
    Rhenish on my head once. This sa
me skull, sir, was Yorick's
    skull, the King's jester.
  Ham. This?
  Clown. E'en that.
  Ham
. Let me see. [Takes the skull.] Alas, poor Yorick! I knew
him,
    Horatio. A fellow of infinite 
jest, of most excellent fancy.
He
    hath borne me on his back a thousand times. And now how
abh
orred
    in my imagination it is! My gorge rises at it. Here hung
those
    lips that I have kis
s'd I know not how oft. Where be your
gibes
    now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of mer
riment that
    were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock
your
    own grinning?
 Quite chap- fall'n? Now get you to my lady's
    chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thic
k, to this
    favour she must come. Make her laugh at that. Prithee,
Horatio,
    tell me one th
ing.
  Hor. What's that, my lord?
  Ham. Dost thou think Alexander look'd o' this fashion i' th'

earth?
  Hor. E'en so.
  Ham. And smelt so? Pah!
                                          [Puts 
down the skull.]
  Hor. E'en so, my lord.
  Ham. To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may
 not
    imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it
    stopping a bunghole?
 
 Hor. 'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.
  Ham. No, faith, not a jot; but to follow 
him thither with
modesty
    enough, and likelihood to lead it; as thus: Alexander died,
    Alex
ander was buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust
is
    earth; of earth we make loam; and
 why of that loam (whereto
he
    was converted) might they not stop a beer barrel?
    Imperious
 Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
    Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.
    O, that that ea
rth which kept the world in awe
    Should patch a wall t' expel the winter's flaw!
    But soft! 
but soft! aside! Here comes the King-

    Enter [priests with] a coffin [in funeral procession], 
King,
             Queen, Laertes, with Lords attendant.]

    The Queen, the courtiers. Who is t
his they follow?
    And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken
    The corse they follow did w
ith desp'rate hand
    Fordo it own life. 'Twas of some estate.
    Couch we awhile, and mark.
  
                                       [Retires with Horatio.]

  Laer. What ceremony else?
  Ham
. That is Laertes,
    A very noble youth. Mark.
  Laer. What ceremony else?
  Priest. Her obsequ
ies have been as far enlarg'd
    As we have warranty. Her death was doubtful;
    And, but that g
reat command o'ersways the order,
    She should in ground unsanctified have lodg'd
    Till the l
ast trumpet. For charitable prayers,
    Shards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on her.
    
Yet here she is allow'd her virgin rites,
    Her maiden strewments, and the bringing home
    Of 
bell and burial.
  Laer. Must there no more be done?
  Priest. No more be done.
    We should pro
fane the service of the dead
    To sing a requiem and such rest to her
    As to peace-parted sou
ls.
  Laer. Lay her i' th' earth;
    And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
    May violets spri
ng! I tell thee, churlish priest,
    A minist'ring angel shall my sister be
    When thou liest h
owling.
  Ham. What, the fair Ophelia?
  Queen. Sweets to the sweet! Farewell.
                  
                           [Scatters flowers.]
    I hop'd thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife
;
    I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
    And not have strew'd thy grave.
  L
aer. O, treble woe
    Fall ten times treble on that cursed head
    Whose wicked deed thy most in
genious sense
    Depriv'd thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,
    Till I have caught her once mor
e in mine arms.
                                             Leaps in the grave.
    Now pile your
 dust upon the quick and dead
    Till of this flat a mountain you have made
    T' o'ertop old Pe
lion or the skyish head
    Of blue Olympus.
  Ham. [comes forward] What is he whose grief
    Be
ars such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow
    Conjures the wand'ring stars, and makes them stand

    Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,
    Hamlet the Dane.                    [Leaps in aft
er Laertes.
  Laer. The devil take thy soul!
                                            [Grapples
 with him].
  Ham. Thou pray'st not well.
    I prithee take thy fingers from my throat;
    For,
 though I am not splenitive and rash,
    Yet have I in me something dangerous,
    Which let thy 
wisdom fear. Hold off thy hand!
  King. Pluck them asunder.
  Queen. Hamlet, Hamlet!
  All. Gentl
emen!
  Hor. Good my lord, be quiet.
             [The Attendants part them, and they come out of 
the
                                                         grave.]
  Ham. Why, I will fight with
 him upon this theme
    Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
  Queen. O my son, what theme?
  Ha
m. I lov'd Ophelia. Forty thousand brothers
    Could not (with all their quantity of love)
    Ma
ke up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?
  King. O, he is mad, Laertes.
  Queen. For love of God, 
forbear him!
  Ham. 'Swounds, show me what thou't do.
    Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo
't tear thyself?
    Woo't drink up esill? eat a crocodile?
    I'll do't. Dost thou come here to 
whine?
    To outface me with leaping in her grave?
    Be buried quick with her, and so will I.

    And if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
    Millions of acres on us, till our ground,
 
   Singeing his pate against the burning zone,
    Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
 
   I'll rant as well as thou.
  Queen. This is mere madness;
    And thus a while the fit will wor
k on him.
    Anon, as patient as the female dove
    When that her golden couplets are disclos'd,

    His silence will sit drooping.
  Ham. Hear you, sir!
    What is the reason that you use me 
thus?
    I lov'd you ever. But it is no matter.
    Let Hercules himself do what he may,
    The
 cat will mew, and dog will have his day.
Exit.
  King. I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.

                                                   Exit Horatio.
    [To Laertes] Strengthen your 
patience in our last night's
speech.
    We'll put the matter to the present push.-
    Good Gert
rude, set some watch over your son.-
    This grave shall have a living monument.
    An hour of q
uiet shortly shall we see;
    Till then in patience our proceeding be.
                          
                               Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A hall in the Castle.

Enter 
Hamlet and Horatio.

  Ham. So much for this, sir; now shall you see the other.
    You do rememb
er all the circumstance?
  Hor. Remember it, my lord!
  Ham. Sir, in my heart there was a kind of 
fighting
    That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay
    Worse than the mutinies in the bilbo
es. Rashly-
    And prais'd be rashness for it; let us know,
    Our indiscretion sometime serves 
us well
    When our deep plots do pall; and that should learn us
    There's a divinity that shap
es our ends,
    Rough-hew them how we will-
  Hor. That is most certain.
  Ham. Up from my cabin
,
    My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
    Grop'd I to find out them; had my desire,
   
 Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew
    To mine own room again; making so bold
    (My fe
ars forgetting manners) to unseal
    Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio
    (O royal 
knavery!), an exact command,
    Larded with many several sorts of reasons,
    Importing Denmark'
s health, and England's too,
    With, hoo! such bugs and goblins in my life-
    That, on the sup
ervise, no leisure bated,
    No, not to stay the finding of the axe,
    My head should be struck
 off.
  Hor. Is't possible?
  Ham. Here's the commission; read it at more leisure.
    But wilt t
hou bear me how I did proceed?
  Hor. I beseech you.
  Ham. Being thus benetted round with villani
es,
    Or I could make a prologue to my brains,
    They had begun the play. I sat me down;
    
Devis'd a new commission; wrote it fair.
    I once did hold it, as our statists do,
    A basenes
s to write fair, and labour'd much
    How to forget that learning; but, sir, now
    It did me ye
oman's service. Wilt thou know
    Th' effect of what I wrote?
  Hor. Ay, good my lord.
  Ham. An
 earnest conjuration from the King,
    As England was his faithful tributary,
    As love between
 them like the palm might flourish,
    As peace should still her wheaten garland wear
    And sta
nd a comma 'tween their amities,
    And many such-like as's of great charge,
    That, on the vie
w and knowing of these contents,
    Without debatement further, more or less,
    He should the b
earers put to sudden death,
    Not shriving time allow'd.
  Hor. How was this seal'd?
  Ham. Why
, even in that was heaven ordinant.
    I had my father's signet in my purse,
    Which was the mo
del of that Danish seal;
    Folded the writ up in the form of th' other,
    Subscrib'd it, gave'
t th' impression, plac'd it safely,
    The changeling never known. Now, the next day
    Was our 
sea-fight; and what to this was sequent
    Thou know'st already.
  Hor. So Guildenstern and Rosen
crantz go to't.
  Ham. Why, man, they did make love to this employment!
    They are not near my c
onscience; their defeat
    Does by their own insinuation grow.
    'Tis dangerous when the baser 
nature comes
    Between the pass and fell incensed points
    Of mighty opposites.
  Hor. Why, w
hat a king is this!
  Ham. Does it not, thinks't thee, stand me now upon-
    He that hath kill'd 
my king, and whor'd my mother;
    Popp'd in between th' election and my hopes;
    Thrown out his
 angle for my proper life,
    And with such coz'nage- is't not perfect conscience
    To quit him
 with this arm? And is't not to be damn'd
    To let this canker of our nature come
    In further
 evil?
  Hor. It must be shortly known to him from England
    What is the issue of the business t
here.
  Ham. It will be short; the interim is mine,
    And a man's life is no more than to say 'o
ne.'
    But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
    That to Laertes I forgot myself,
    For by the i
mage of my cause I see
    The portraiture of his. I'll court his favours.
    But sure the braver
y of his grief did put me
    Into a tow'ring passion.
  Hor. Peace! Who comes here?

          
       Enter young Osric, a courtier.

  Osr. Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
  H
am. I humbly thank you, sir. [Aside to Horatio] Dost know this
    waterfly?
  Hor. [aside to Haml
et] No, my good lord.
  Ham. [aside to Horatio] Thy state is the more gracious; for
'tis a
    vi
ce to know him. He hath much land, and fertile. Let a beast
be
    lord of beasts, and his crib sh
all stand at the king's mess.
'Tis
    a chough; but, as I say, spacious in the possession of dirt
.

  Osr. Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should
impart
    a thing to you from 
his Majesty.
  Ham. I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit. Put
your
    bonnet to 
his right use. 'Tis for the head.
  Osr. I thank your lordship, it is very hot.
  Ham. No, believe
 me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly.
  Osr. It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
  Ham.
 But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my
complexion.
  Osr. Exceedingly, my lord; it is 
very sultry, as 'twere- I
cannot
    tell how. But, my lord, his Majesty bade me signify to you
t
hat
    he has laid a great wager on your head. Sir, this is the
matter-
  Ham. I beseech you rem
ember.
                           [Hamlet moves him to put on his hat.]
  Osr. Nay, good my lord; 
for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here
is
    newly come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolut
e
gentleman,
    full of most excellent differences, of very soft society and
    great showing. 
Indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the
card
    or calendar of gentry; for you shall find in
 him the
continent of
    what part a gentleman would see.
  Ham. Sir, his definement suffers no 
perdition in you; though, I

    know, to divide him inventorially would dozy th' arithmetic
of

    memory, and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail.
    But, in the verity of extolme
nt, I take him to be a soul of
great
    article, and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as,
 to
make
    true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror, and who
else
    would trace him,
 his umbrage, nothing more.
  Osr. Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
  Ham. The concern
ancy, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our
more
    rawer breath?
  Osr. Sir?
  Hor [aside t
o Hamlet] Is't not possible to understand in
another
    tongue? You will do't, sir, really.
  Ha
m. What imports the nomination of this gentleman?
  Osr. Of Laertes?
  Hor. [aside] His purse is e
mpty already. All's golden words are
    spent.
  Ham. Of him, sir.
  Osr. I know you are not ign
orant-
  Ham. I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would
not
    much approve me. 
Well, sir?
  Osr. You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is-
  Ham. I dare not confess th
at, lest I should compare with him in
    excellence; but to know a man well were to know himself.

  Osr. I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on
him
    by them, in his meed he
's unfellowed.
  Ham. What's his weapon?
  Osr. Rapier and dagger.
  Ham. That's two of his weapo
ns- but well.
  Osr. The King, sir, hath wager'd with him six Barbary horses;
    against the whic
h he has impon'd, as I take it, six French
    rapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle,
 hangers,
and
    so. Three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy,
    very responsi
ve to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of
    very liberal conceit.
  Ham. What call you th
e carriages?
  Hor. [aside to Hamlet] I knew you must be edified by the
margent
    ere you had d
one.
  Osr. The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
  Ham. The phrase would be more germane to the ma
tter if we could
    carry cannon by our sides. I would it might be hangers till
then.
    But on
! Six Barbary horses against six French swords, their
    assigns, and three liberal-conceited carr
iages: that's the
French
    bet against the Danish. Why is this all impon'd, as you call
it?
  
Osr. The King, sir, hath laid that, in a dozen passes between
    yourself and him, he shall not ex
ceed you three hits; he hath
    laid on twelve for nine, and it would come to immediate trial
   
 if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.
  Ham. How if I answer no?
  Osr. I mean, my lord, t
he opposition of your person in trial.
  Ham. Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please his

Majesty,
    it is the breathing time of day with me. Let the foils be
    brought, the gentleman 
willing, and the King hold his
purpose,
    I will win for him if I can; if not, I will gain nothi
ng but
my
    shame and the odd hits.
  Osr. Shall I redeliver you e'en so?
  Ham. To this effec
t, sir, after what flourish your nature will.
  Osr. I commend my duty to your lordship.
  Ham. Yo
urs, yours. [Exit Osric.] He does well to commend it
    himself; there are no tongues else for's t
urn.
  Hor. This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.
  Ham. He did comply with his dug b
efore he suck'd it. Thus has
he,
    and many more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age
do
tes
    on, only got the tune of the time and outward habit of
encounter-
    a kind of yesty col
lection, which carries them through and
    through the most fann'd and winnowed opinions; and do b
ut
blow
    them to their trial-the bubbles are out,

                            Enter a Lord.


  Lord. My lord, his Majesty commended him to you by young Osric,
who
    brings back to him, t
hat you attend him in the hall. He sends
to
    know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes, o
r that you
will
    take longer time.
  Ham. I am constant to my purposes; they follow the King's

pleasure.
    If his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or whensoever,
provided
    I be so abl
e as now.
  Lord. The King and Queen and all are coming down.
  Ham. In happy time.
  Lord. The Q
ueen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to
    Laertes before you fall to play.
  Ham. S
he well instructs me.
                                                    [Exit Lord.]
  Hor. You 
will lose this wager, my lord.
  Ham. I do not think so. Since he went into France I have been
in

    continual practice. I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst
not
    think how ill all's her
e about my heart. But it is no matter.
  Hor. Nay, good my lord -
  Ham. It is but foolery; but it
 is such a kind of gaingiving as
    would perhaps trouble a woman.
  Hor. If your mind dislike an
ything, obey it. I will forestall
their
    repair hither and say you are not fit.
  Ham. Not a w
hit, we defy augury; there's a special providence
in
    the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis
 not to come; if it
be
    not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will
come:
    
the readiness is all. Since no man knows aught of what he
leaves,
    what is't to leave betimes? 
Let be.

    Enter King, Queen, Laertes, Osric, and Lords, with other
              Attendants wi
th foils and gauntlets.
               A table and flagons of wine on it.

  King. Come, Hamlet, 
come, and take this hand from me.
                    [The King puts Laertes' hand into Hamlet's.]

  Ham. Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong;
    But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.

    This presence knows,
    And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd
    With sore distr
action. What I have done
    That might your nature, honour, and exception
    Roughly awake, I he
re proclaim was madness.
    Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet.
    If Hamlet from himsel
f be taken away,
    And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
    Then Hamlet does it not, Ha
mlet denies it.
    Who does it, then? His madness. If't be so,
    Hamlet is of the faction that 
is wrong'd;
    His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
    Sir, in this audience,
    Let my disclai
ming from a purpos'd evil
    Free me so far in your most generous thoughts
    That I have shot m
y arrow o'er the house
    And hurt my brother.
  Laer. I am satisfied in nature,
    Whose motiv
e in this case should stir me most
    To my revenge. But in my terms of honour
    I stand aloof,
 and will no reconcilement
    Till by some elder masters of known honour
    I have a voice and p
recedent of peace
    To keep my name ungor'd. But till that time
    I do receive your offer'd lo
ve like love,
    And will not wrong it.
  Ham. I embrace it freely,
    And will this brother's 
wager frankly play.
    Give us the foils. Come on.
  Laer. Come, one for me.
  Ham. I'll be your
 foil, Laertes. In mine ignorance
    Your skill shall, like a star i' th' darkest night,
    Stic
k fiery off indeed.
  Laer. You mock me, sir.
  Ham. No, by this hand.
  King. Give them the foil
s, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
    You know the wager?
  Ham. Very well, my lord.
    Your Grace 
has laid the odds o' th' weaker side.
  King. I do not fear it, I have seen you both;
    But sinc
e he is better'd, we have therefore odds.
  Laer. This is too heavy; let me see another.
  Ham. Th
is likes me well. These foils have all a length?
                                                Pr
epare to play.
  Osr. Ay, my good lord.
  King. Set me the stoups of wine upon that table.
    If
 Hamlet give the first or second hit,
    Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
    Let all the
 battlements their ordnance fire;
    The King shall drink to Hamlet's better breath,
    And in t
he cup an union shall he throw
    Richer than that which four successive kings
    In Denmark's c
rown have worn. Give me the cups;
    And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
    The trumpet to 
the cannoneer without,
    The cannons to the heavens, the heaven to earth,
    'Now the King drin
ks to Hamlet.' Come, begin.
    And you the judges, bear a wary eye.
  Ham. Come on, sir.
  Laer.
 Come, my lord.                                They play.
  Ham. One.
  Laer. No.
  Ham. Judgment
!
  Osr. A hit, a very palpable hit.
  Laer. Well, again!
  King. Stay, give me drink. Hamlet, th
is pearl is thine;
    Here's to thy health.
               [Drum; trumpets sound; a piece goes of
f [within].
    Give him the cup.
  Ham. I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile.
    Come. (
They play.) Another hit. What say you?
  Laer. A touch, a touch; I do confess't.
  King. Our son s
hall win.
  Queen. He's fat, and scant of breath.
    Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows.

    The Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
  Ham. Good madam!
  King. Gertrude, do not drink
.
  Queen. I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.          Drinks.
  King. [aside] It is the poiso
n'd cup; it is too late.
  Ham. I dare not drink yet, madam; by-and-by.
  Queen. Come, let me wipe
 thy face.
  Laer. My lord, I'll hit him now.
  King. I do not think't.
  Laer. [aside] And yet i
t is almost against my conscience.
  Ham. Come for the third, Laertes! You but dally.
    Pray you
 pass with your best violence;
    I am afeard you make a wanton of me.
  Laer. Say you so? Come o
n.                               Play.
  Osr. Nothing neither way.
  Laer. Have at you now!
     
           [Laertes wounds Hamlet; then] in scuffling, they
                    change rapiers, [an
d Hamlet wounds Laertes].
  King. Part them! They are incens'd.
  Ham. Nay come! again!           
              The Queen falls.

  Osr. Look to the Queen there, ho!
  Hor. They bleed on both sid
es. How is it, my lord?
  Osr. How is't, Laertes?
  Laer. Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, 
Osric.
    I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.
  Ham. How does the Queen?
  King. She sou
nds to see them bleed.
  Queen. No, no! the drink, the drink! O my dear Hamlet!
    The drink, the
 drink! I am poison'd.                 [Dies.]
  Ham. O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd.
    T
reachery! Seek it out.
                                                [Laertes falls.]
  Laer. It
 is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain;
    No medicine in the world can do thee good.
    In th
ee there is not half an hour of life.
    The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
    Unbated a
nd envenom'd. The foul practice
    Hath turn'd itself on me. Lo, here I lie,
    Never to rise ag
ain. Thy mother's poison'd.
    I can no more. The King, the King's to blame.
  Ham. The point env
enom'd too?
    Then, venom, to thy work.                    Hurts the King.
  All. Treason! treas
on!
  King. O, yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt.
  Ham. Here, thou incestuous, murd'rous, dam
ned Dane,
    Drink off this potion! Is thy union here?
    Follow my mother.                     
            King dies.
  Laer. He is justly serv'd.
    It is a poison temper'd by himself.
    E
xchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet.
    Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
    
Nor thine on me!                                       Dies.
  Ham. Heaven make thee free of it! I 
follow thee.
    I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!
    You that look pale and tremble at 
this chance,
    That are but mutes or audience to this act,
    Had I but time (as this fell serg
eant, Death,
    Is strict in his arrest) O, I could tell you-
    But let it be. Horatio, I am de
ad;
    Thou liv'st; report me and my cause aright
    To the unsatisfied.
  Hor. Never believe i
t.
    I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.
    Here's yet some liquor left.
  Ham. As th'art 
a man,
    Give me the cup. Let go! By heaven, I'll ha't.
    O good Horatio, what a wounded name

    (Things standing thus unknown) shall live behind me!
    If thou didst ever hold me in thy hea
rt,
    Absent thee from felicity awhile,
    And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
  
  To tell my story.         [March afar off, and shot within.]
    What warlike noise is this?
  O
sr. Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
    To the ambassadors of England gives
    
This warlike volley.
  Ham. O, I die, Horatio!
    The potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit.
 
   I cannot live to hear the news from England,
    But I do prophesy th' election lights
    On F
ortinbras. He has my dying voice.
    So tell him, with th' occurrents, more and less,
    Which h
ave solicited- the rest is silence.             Dies.
  Hor. Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, 
sweet prince,
    And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
                                   
              [March within.]
    Why does the drum come hither?

    Enter Fortinbras and Englis
h Ambassadors, with Drum,
                  Colours, and Attendants.

  Fort. Where is this sight
?
  Hor. What is it you will see?
    If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
  Fort. This 
quarry cries on havoc. O proud Death,
    What feast is toward in thine eternal cell
    That thou
 so many princes at a shot
    So bloodily hast struck.
  Ambassador. The sight is dismal;
    An
d our affairs from England come too late.
    The ears are senseless that should give us hearing
 
   To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd
    That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.
    Wh
ere should we have our thanks?
  Hor. Not from his mouth,
    Had it th' ability of life to thank 
you.
    He never gave commandment for their death.
    But since, so jump upon this bloody questi
on,
    You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
    Are here arriv'd, give order that thes
e bodies
    High on a stage be placed to the view;
    And let me speak to the yet unknowing worl
d
    How these things came about. So shall you hear
    Of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts;
  
  Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters;
    Of deaths put on by cunning and forc'd cause;
  
  And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
    Fall'n on th' inventors' heads. All this can I
    Tru
ly deliver.
  Fort. Let us haste to hear it,
    And call the noblest to the audience.
    For me
, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.
    I have some rights of memory in this kingdom
    Which now
, to claim my vantage doth invite me.
  Hor. Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
    And fro
m his mouth whose voice will draw on more.
    But let this same be presently perform'd,
    Even 
while men's minds are wild, lest more mischance
    On plots and errors happen.
  Fort. Let four c
aptains
    Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage;
    For he was likely, had he been put on,
 
   To have prov'd most royally; and for his passage
    The soldiers' music and the rites of war
 
   Speak loudly for him.
    Take up the bodies. Such a sight as this
    Becomes the field but he
re shows much amiss.
    Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
            Exeunt marching; after the which 
a peal of ordnance
                                                   are shot off.

ACT I. Scene I.
Elsinore. A platform before the Castle.


Enter two Sentinels-[first,] Francisco, [who paces up and down
at his post; then] Bernardo, [who 
approaches him].

  Ber. Who's there?
  Fran. Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.
  Ber. 
Long live the King!
  Fran. Bernardo?
  Ber. He.
  Fran. You come most carefully upon your hour.

  Ber. 'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.
  Fran. For this relief much thanks. 'T
is bitter cold,
    And I am sick at heart.
  Ber. Have you had quiet guard?
  Fran. Not a mouse 
stirring.
  Ber. Well, good night.
    If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
    The rivals of my
 watch, bid them make haste.

                    Enter Horatio and Marcellus.

  Fran. I think 
I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?
  Hor. Friends to this ground.
  Mar. And liegemen to the Da
ne.
  Fran. Give you good night.
  Mar. O, farewell, honest soldier.
    Who hath reliev'd you?

  Fran. Bernardo hath my place.
    Give you good night.                                   Exit.
 
 Mar. Holla, Bernardo!
  Ber. Say-
    What, is Horatio there ?
  Hor. A piece of him.
  Ber. We
lcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.
  Mar. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
  Be
r. I have seen nothing.
  Mar. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
    And will not let belief take
 hold of him
    Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.
    Therefore I have entreated him
 along,
    With us to watch the minutes of this night,
    That, if again this apparition come,

    He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
  Hor. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
  Ber. Sit down
 awhile,
    And let us once again assail your ears,
    That are so fortified against our story,

    What we two nights have seen.
  Hor. Well, sit we down,
    And let us hear Bernardo speak of
 this.
  Ber. Last night of all,
    When yond same star that's westward from the pole
    Had ma
de his course t' illume that part of heaven
    Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
    The 
bell then beating one-

                        Enter Ghost.

  Mar. Peace! break thee off! Look
 where it comes again!
  Ber. In the same figure, like the King that's dead.
  Mar. Thou art a sch
olar; speak to it, Horatio.
  Ber. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.
  Hor. Most like.
 It harrows me with fear and wonder.
  Ber. It would be spoke to.
  Mar. Question it, Horatio.
  
Hor. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night
    Together with that fair and warlike form
 
   In which the majesty of buried Denmark
    Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!

  Mar. It is offended.
  Ber. See, it stalks away!
  Hor. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!

                                                     Exit Ghost.
  Mar. 'Tis gone and will not an
swer.
  Ber. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale.
    Is not this something more than fant
asy?
    What think you on't?
  Hor. Before my God, I might not this believe
    Without the sens
ible and true avouch
    Of mine own eyes.
  Mar. Is it not like the King?
  Hor. As thou art to 
thyself.
    Such was the very armour he had on
    When he th' ambitious Norway combated.
    So
 frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,
    He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
    'Tis st
range.
  Mar. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
    With martial stalk hath he gone b
y our watch.
  Hor. In what particular thought to work I know not;
    But, in the gross and scope
 of my opinion,
    This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
  Mar. Good now, sit down, and 
tell me he that knows,
    Why this same strict and most observant watch
    So nightly toils the 
subject of the land,
    And why such daily cast of brazen cannon
    And foreign mart for impleme
nts of war;
    Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
    Does not divide the Sunday fr
om the week.
    What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
    Doth make the night joint-labour
er with the day?
    Who is't that can inform me?
  Hor. That can I.
    At least, the whisper go
es so. Our last king,
    Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
    Was, as you know, by Fortin
bras of Norway,
    Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
    Dar'd to the combat; in which 
our valiant Hamlet
    (For so this side of our known world esteem'd him)
    Did slay this Fortin
bras; who, by a seal'd compact,
    Well ratified by law and heraldry,
    Did forfeit, with his l
ife, all those his lands
    Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror;
    Against the which a m
oiety competent
    Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
    To the inheritance of Fortinbras
,
    Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant
    And carriage of the article design'd,

    His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
    Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
    Hat
h in the skirts of Norway, here and there,
    Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
    For foo
d and diet, to some enterprise
    That hath a stomach in't; which is no other,
    As it doth wel
l appear unto our state,
    But to recover of us, by strong hand
    And terms compulsatory, thos
e foresaid lands
    So by his father lost; and this, I take it,
    Is the main motive of our pre
parations,
    The source of this our watch, and the chief head
    Of this post-haste and romage 
in the land.
  Ber. I think it be no other but e'en so.
    Well may it sort that this portentous 
figure
    Comes armed through our watch, so like the King
    That was and is the question of the
se wars.
  Hor. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
    In the most high and palmy state of Ro
me,
    A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
    The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted d
ead
    Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;
    As stars with trains of fire, and dews of 
blood,
    Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
    Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stan
ds
    Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.
    And even the like precurse of fierce events,

    As harbingers preceding still the fates
    And prologue to the omen coming on,
    Have heav
en and earth together demonstrated
    Unto our climature and countrymen.

                      
Enter Ghost again.

    But soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again!
    I'll cross it, though it 
blast me.- Stay illusion!
                                               Spreads his arms.
    If 
thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
    Speak to me.
    If there be any good thing to be done,

    That may to thee do ease, and, race to me,
    Speak to me.
    If thou art privy to thy coun
try's fate,
    Which happily foreknowing may avoid,
    O, speak!
    Or if thou hast uphoarded 
in thy life
    Extorted treasure in the womb of earth
    (For which, they say, you spirits oft w
alk in death),
                                                 The cock crows.
    Speak of it! S
tay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!
  Mar. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
  Hor. Do, if i
t will not stand.
  Ber. 'Tis here!
  Hor. 'Tis here!
  Mar. 'Tis gone!
                        
                             Exit Ghost.
    We do it wrong, being so majestical,
    To offer it 
the show of violence;
    For it is as the air, invulnerable,
    And our vain blows malicious moc
kery.
  Ber. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
  Hor. And then it started, like a guilty 
thing
    Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
    The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
   
 Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
    Awake the god of day; and at his warning,
    
Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
    Th' extravagant and erring spirit hies
    To his con
fine; and of the truth herein
    This present object made probation.
  Mar. It faded on the crowi
ng of the cock.
    Some say that ever, 'gainst that season comes
    Wherein our Saviour's birth 
is celebrated,
    The bird of dawning singeth all night long;
    And then, they say, no spirit d
are stir abroad,
    The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,
    No fairy takes, nor wit
ch hath power to charm,
    So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
  Hor. So have I heard and do
 in part believe it.
    But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
    Walks o'er the dew of yon 
high eastward hill.
    Break we our watch up; and by my advice
    Let us impart what we have see
n to-night
    Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
    This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to hi
m.
    Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
    As needful in our loves, fitting our duty
?
    Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
    Where we shall find him most conveniently.  
         Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A room of state in the Castle.

Flourish. [Enter Cl
audius, King of Denmark, Gertrude the Queen,
Hamlet,
Polonius, Laertes and his sister Ophelia, [Vo
ltemand, Cornelius,]
Lords Attendant.

  King. Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
   
 The memory be green, and that it us befitted
    To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdo
m
    To be contracted in one brow of woe,
    Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
    
That we with wisest sorrow think on him
    Together with remembrance of ourselves.
    Therefore 
our sometime sister, now our queen,
    Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,
    Have we,
 as 'twere with a defeated joy,
    With an auspicious, and a dropping eye,
    With mirth in fune
ral, and with dirge in marriage,
    In equal scale weighing delight and dole,
    Taken to wife; 
nor have we herein barr'd
    Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
    With this affair alo
ng. For all, our thanks.
    Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
    Holding a weak supp
osal of our worth,
    Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
    Our state to be disjoint a
nd out of frame,
    Colleagued with this dream of his advantage,
    He hath not fail'd to pester
 us with message
    Importing the surrender of those lands
    Lost by his father, with all bands
 of law,
    To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
    Now for ourself and for this time o
f meeting.
    Thus much the business is: we have here writ
    To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbr
as,
    Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears
    Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress
  
  His further gait herein, in that the levies,
    The lists, and full proportions are all made
  
  Out of his subject; and we here dispatch
    You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,
    For be
arers of this greeting to old Norway,
    Giving to you no further personal power
    To business 
with the King, more than the scope
    Of these dilated articles allow.            [Gives a paper.]

    Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
  Cor., Volt. In that, and all things, will w
e show our duty.
  King. We doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell.
                                 
Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius.
    And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
    You told us of
 some suit. What is't, Laertes?
    You cannot speak of reason to the Dane
    And lose your voice
. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
    That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
    The head is 
not more native to the heart,
    The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
    Than is the throne 
of Denmark to thy father.
    What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
  Laer. My dread lord,
    Your le
ave and favour to return to France;
    From whence though willingly I came to Denmark
    To show
 my duty in your coronation,
    Yet now I must confess, that duty done,
    My thoughts and wishe
s bend again toward France
    And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
  King. Have you yo
ur father's leave? What says Polonius?
  Pol. He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
    By
 laboursome petition, and at last
    Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent.
    I do beseech you
 give him leave to go.
  King. Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,
    And thy best graces
 spend it at thy will!
    But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son-
  Ham. [aside] A little more tha
n kin, and less than kind!
  King. How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
  Ham. Not so, my 
lord. I am too much i' th' sun.
  Queen. Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
    And let thi
ne eye look like a friend on Denmark.
    Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
    Seek for thy no
ble father in the dust.
    Thou know'st 'tis common. All that lives must die,
    Passing through
 nature to eternity.
  Ham. Ay, madam, it is common.
  Queen. If it be,
    Why seems it so parti
cular with thee?
  Ham. Seems, madam, Nay, it is. I know not 'seems.'
    'Tis not alone my inky c
loak, good mother,
    Nor customary suits of solemn black,
    Nor windy suspiration of forc'd br
eath,
    No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
    Nor the dejected havior of the visage,
    T
ogether with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
    'That can denote me truly. These indeed seem,

    For they are actions that a man might play;
    But I have that within which passeth show-
   
 These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
  King. 'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, H
amlet,
    To give these mourning duties to your father;
    But you must know, your father lost a
 father;
    That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
    In filial obligation for some 
term
    To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever
    In obstinate condolement is a course
    Of
 impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief;
    It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
    A hea
rt unfortified, a mind impatient,
    An understanding simple and unschool'd;
    For what we know
 must be, and is as common
    As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
    Why should we in our pee
vish opposition
    Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
    A fault against the dead, a
 fault to nature,
    To reason most absurd, whose common theme
    Is death of fathers, and who s
till hath cried,
    From the first corse till he that died to-day,
    'This must be so.' We pray
 you throw to earth
    This unprevailing woe, and think of us
    As of a father; for let the wor
ld take note
    You are the most immediate to our throne,
    And with no less nobility of love

    Than that which dearest father bears his son
    Do I impart toward you. For your intent
    I
n going back to school in Wittenberg,
    It is most retrograde to our desire;
    And we beseech 
you, bend you to remain
    Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
    Our chiefest courtier, c
ousin, and our son.
  Queen. Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.
    I pray thee stay wit
h us, go not to Wittenberg.
  Ham. I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
  King. Why, 'tis a lov
ing and a fair reply.
    Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come.
    This gentle and unforc'd acco
rd of Hamlet
    Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,
    No jocund health that Denmark dri
nks to-day
    But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
    And the King's rouse the heaven 
shall bruit again,
    Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.
                                Flou
rish. Exeunt all but Hamlet.
  Ham. O that this too too solid flesh would melt,
    Thaw, and reso
lve itself into a dew!
    Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
    His canon 'gainst self-slaugh
ter! O God! God!
    How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
    Seem to me all the uses of this 
world!
    Fie on't! ah, fie! 'Tis an unweeded garden
    That grows to seed; things rank and gros
s in nature
    Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
    But two months dead! Nay, not 
so much, not two.
    So excellent a king, that was to this
    Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to 
my mother
    That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
    Visit her face too roughly. Heaven 
and earth!
    Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him
    As if increase of appetite had grow
n
    By what it fed on; and yet, within a month-
    Let me not think on't! Frailty, thy name is 
woman!-
    A little month, or ere those shoes were old
    With which she followed my poor father
's body
    Like Niobe, all tears- why she, even she
    (O God! a beast that wants discourse of r
eason
    Would have mourn'd longer) married with my uncle;
    My father's brother, but no more l
ike my father
    Than I to Hercules. Within a month,
    Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tea
rs
    Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
    She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
 
   With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
    It is not, nor it cannot come to good.
    But br
eak my heart, for I must hold my tongue!

          Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo.

  H
or. Hail to your lordship!
  Ham. I am glad to see you well.
    Horatio!- or I do forget myself.

  Hor. The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
  Ham. Sir, my good friend- I'll change that
 name with you.
    And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?
    Marcellus?
  Mar. My good lor
d!
  Ham. I am very glad to see you.- [To Bernardo] Good even, sir.-

    But what, in faith, mak
e you from Wittenberg?
  Hor. A truant disposition, good my lord.
  Ham. I would not hear your ene
my say so,
    Nor shall you do my ear that violence
    To make it truster of your own report
  
  Against yourself. I know you are no truant.
    But what is your affair in Elsinore?
    We'll t
each you to drink deep ere you depart.
  Hor. My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
  Ham.
 I prithee do not mock me, fellow student.
    I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
  Hor. I
ndeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.
  Ham. Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats
   
 Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
    Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
    Or
 ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
    My father- methinks I see my father.
  Hor. O, where, my l
ord?
  Ham. In my mind's eye, Horatio.
  Hor. I saw him once. He was a goodly king.
  Ham. He was
 a man, take him for all in all.
    I shall not look upon his like again.
  Hor. My lord, I think
 I saw him yesternight.
  Ham. Saw? who?
  Hor. My lord, the King your father.
  Ham. The King my
 father?
  Hor. Season your admiration for a while
    With an attent ear, till I may deliver
   
 Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
    This marvel to you.
  Ham. For God's love let me hear!

  Hor. Two nights together had these gentlemen
    (Marcellus and Bernardo) on their watch
    In 
the dead vast and middle of the night
    Been thus encount'red. A figure like your father,
    Ar
med at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
    Appears before them and with solemn march
    Goes slow and st
ately by them. Thrice he walk'd
    By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
    Within his tru
ncheon's length; whilst they distill'd
    Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
    Stand dumb an
d speak not to him. This to me
    In dreadful secrecy impart they did,
    And I with them the th
ird night kept the watch;
    Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
    Form of the thing, e
ach word made true and good,
    The apparition comes. I knew your father.
    These hands are not
 more like.
  Ham. But where was this?
  Mar. My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
  Ham.
 Did you not speak to it?
  Hor. My lord, I did;
    But answer made it none. Yet once methought

    It lifted up it head and did address
    Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
    But eve
n then the morning cock crew loud,
    And at the sound it shrunk in haste away
    And vanish'd f
rom our sight.
  Ham. 'Tis very strange.
  Hor. As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
    An
d we did think it writ down in our duty
    To let you know of it.
  Ham. Indeed, indeed, sirs. Bu
t this troubles me.
    Hold you the watch to-night?
  Both [Mar. and Ber.] We do, my lord.
  Ham
. Arm'd, say you?
  Both. Arm'd, my lord.
  Ham. From top to toe?
  Both. My lord, from head to f
oot.
  Ham. Then saw you not his face?
  Hor. O, yes, my lord! He wore his beaver up.
  Ham. What
, look'd he frowningly.
  Hor. A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
  Ham. Pale or red?
  
Hor. Nay, very pale.
  Ham. And fix'd his eyes upon you?
  Hor. Most constantly.
  Ham. I would I
 had been there.
  Hor. It would have much amaz'd you.
  Ham. Very like, very like. Stay'd it long
?
  Hor. While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
  Both. Longer, longer.
  Hor. Not w
hen I saw't.
  Ham. His beard was grizzled- no?
  Hor. It was, as I have seen it in his life,
   
 A sable silver'd.
  Ham. I will watch to-night.
    Perchance 'twill walk again.
  Hor. I warr'n
t it will.
  Ham. If it assume my noble father's person,
    I'll speak to it, though hell itself 
should gape
    And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
    If you have hitherto conceal'd this 
sight,
    Let it be tenable in your silence still;
    And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
 
   Give it an understanding but no tongue.
    I will requite your loves. So, fare you well.
    U
pon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
    I'll visit you.
  All. Our duty to your honour.
 
 Ham. Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell.
                                        Exeunt [all but
 Hamlet].
    My father's spirit- in arms? All is not well.
    I doubt some foul play. Would the 
night were come!
    Till then sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,
    Though all the earth 
o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
Exit.




Scene III.
Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius
.

Enter Laertes and Ophelia.

  Laer. My necessaries are embark'd. Farewell.
    And, sister, 
as the winds give benefit
    And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
    But let me hear from you.

  Oph. Do you doubt that?
  Laer. For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,
    Hold it a fash
ion, and a toy in blood;
    A violet in the youth of primy nature,
    Forward, not permanent- sw
eet, not lasting;
    The perfume and suppliance of a minute;
    No more.
  Oph. No more but so?

  Laer. Think it no more.
    For nature crescent does not grow alone
    In thews and bulk; but
 as this temple waxes,
    The inward service of the mind and soul
    Grows wide withal. Perhaps 
he loves you now,
    And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
    The virtue of his will; but you
 must fear,
    His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
    For he himself is subject to h
is birth.
    He may not, as unvalued persons do,
    Carve for himself, for on his choice depends

    The safety and health of this whole state,
    And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd

    Unto the voice and yielding of that body
    Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves
 you,
    It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
    As he in his particular act and place
    
May give his saying deed; which is no further
    Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
    
Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain
    If with too credent ear you list his songs,
    O
r lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
    To his unmast'red importunity.
    Fear it, Op
helia, fear it, my dear sister,
    And keep you in the rear of your affection,
    Out of the sho
t and danger of desire.
    The chariest maid is prodigal enough
    If she unmask her beauty to t
he moon.
    Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes.
    The canker galls the infants of the 
spring
    Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd,
    And in the morn and liquid dew of youth

    Contagious blastments are most imminent.
    Be wary then; best safety lies in fear.
    Yout
h to itself rebels, though none else near.
  Oph. I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep
    
As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
    Do not as some ungracious pastors do,
    Show 
me the steep and thorny way to heaven,
    Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
    Himse
lf the primrose path of dalliance treads
    And recks not his own rede.
  Laer. O, fear me not!


                       Enter Polonius.

    I stay too long. But here my father comes.
    A do
uble blessing is a double grace;
    Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
  Pol. Yet here, Laertes
? Aboard, aboard, for shame!
    The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
    And you are stay'
d for. There- my blessing with thee!
    And these few precepts in thy memory
    Look thou charac
ter. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
    Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.
    Be thou familiar
, but by no means vulgar:
    Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
    Grapple them 
unto thy soul with hoops of steel;
    But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
    Of each new
-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware
    Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,
    Bear't that th
' opposed may beware of thee.
    Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice;
    Take each man's
 censure, but reserve thy judgment.
    Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
    But not express
'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
    For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
    And they in France of
 the best rank and station
    Are most select and generous, chief in that.
    Neither a borrower
 nor a lender be;
    For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
    And borrowing dulls the edge 
of husbandry.
    This above all- to thine own self be true,
    And it must follow, as the night 
the day,
    Thou canst not then be false to any man.
    Farewell. My blessing season this in the
e!
  Laer. Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
  Pol. The time invites you. Go, your servants
 tend.
  Laer. Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well
    What I have said to you.
  Oph. 'Tis in m
y memory lock'd,
    And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
  Laer. Farewell.                 
                         Exit.
  Pol. What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?
  Oph. So please yo
u, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
  Pol. Marry, well bethought!
    'Tis told me he hath very
 oft of late
    Given private time to you, and you yourself
    Have of your audience been most f
ree and bounteous.
    If it be so- as so 'tis put on me,
    And that in way of caution- I must t
ell you
    You do not understand yourself so clearly
    As it behooves my daughter and your hono
ur.
    What is between you? Give me up the truth.
  Oph. He hath, my lord, of late made many tend
ers
    Of his affection to me.
  Pol. Affection? Pooh! You speak like a green girl,
    Unsifted
 in such perilous circumstance.
    Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
  Oph. I do not 
know, my lord, what I should think,
  Pol. Marry, I will teach you! Think yourself a baby
    That
 you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
    Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly
,
    Or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
    Running it thus) you'll tender me a fool.

  Oph. My lord, he hath importun'd me with love
    In honourable fashion.
  Pol. Ay, fashion you
 may call it. Go to, go to!
  Oph. And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
    With alm
ost all the holy vows of heaven.
  Pol. Ay, springes to catch woodcocks! I do know,
    When the b
lood burns, how prodigal the soul
    Lends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter,
    Giving mo
re light than heat, extinct in both
    Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
    You must not
 take for fire. From this time
    Be something scanter of your maiden presence.
    Set your entr
eatments at a higher rate
    Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
    Believe so much in hi
m, that he is young,
    And with a larger tether may he walk
    Than may be given you. In few, O
phelia,
    Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
    Not of that dye which their investm
ents show,
    But mere implorators of unholy suits,
    Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds
,
    The better to beguile. This is for all:
    I would not, in plain terms, from this time fort
h
    Have you so slander any moment leisure
    As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
 
   Look to't, I charge you. Come your ways.
  Oph. I shall obey, my lord.
                        
                                 Exeunt.




Scene IV.
Elsinore. The platform before the Castl
e.

Enter Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus.

  Ham. The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
  Ho
r. It is a nipping and an eager air.
  Ham. What hour now?
  Hor. I think it lacks of twelve.
  M
ar. No, it is struck.
  Hor. Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws near the season
    Wherein the
 spirit held his wont to walk.
                   A flourish of trumpets, and two pieces go off.
 
   What does this mean, my lord?
  Ham. The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
    Keeps
 wassail, and the swagg'ring upspring reels,
    And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
 
   The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out
    The triumph of his pledge.
  Hor. Is it a custom?

  Ham. Ay, marry, is't;
    But to my mind, though I am native here
    And to the manner born, i
t is a custom
    More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
    This heavy-headed revel eas
t and west
    Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations;
    They clip us drunkards and with s
winish phrase
    Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
    From our achievements, though perform
'd at height,
    The pith and marrow of our attribute.
    So oft it chances in particular men
 
   That, for some vicious mole of nature in them,
    As in their birth,- wherein they are not guil
ty,
    Since nature cannot choose his origin,-
    By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
    Oft
 breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
    Or by some habit that too much o'erleavens
    T
he form of plausive manners, that these men
    Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
    Bein
g nature's livery, or fortune's star,
    Their virtues else- be they as pure as grace,
    As inf
inite as man may undergo-
    Shall in the general censure take corruption
    From that particula
r fault. The dram of e'il
    Doth all the noble substance often dout To his own scandal.

      
                   Enter Ghost.

  Hor. Look, my lord, it comes!
  Ham. Angels and ministers of g
race defend us!
    Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
    Bring with thee airs from hea
ven or blasts from hell,
    Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
    Thou com'st in such a questi
onable shape
    That I will speak to thee. I'll call thee Hamlet,
    King, father, royal Dane. O
, answer me?
    Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell
    Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in d
eath,
    Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre
    Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,

    Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws
    To cast thee up again. What may this mean
    That
 thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,
    Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
    Making
 night hideous, and we fools of nature
    So horridly to shake our disposition
    With thoughts 
beyond the reaches of our souls?
    Say, why is this? wherefore? What should we do?
             
                              Ghost beckons Hamlet.
  Hor. It beckons you to go away with it,
    
As if it some impartment did desire
    To you alone.
  Mar. Look with what courteous action
    
It waves you to a more removed ground.
    But do not go with it!
  Hor. No, by no means!
  Ham. 
It will not speak. Then will I follow it.
  Hor. Do not, my lord!
  Ham. Why, what should be the f
ear?
    I do not set my life at a pin's fee;
    And for my soul, what can it do to that,
    Be
ing a thing immortal as itself?
    It waves me forth again. I'll follow it.
  Hor. What if it tem
pt you toward the flood, my lord,
    Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
    That beetles o'er
 his base into the sea,
    And there assume some other, horrible form
    Which might deprive you
r sovereignty of reason
    And draw you into madness? Think of it.
    The very place puts toys o
f desperation,
    Without more motive, into every brain
    That looks so many fadoms to the sea

    And hears it roar beneath.
  Ham. It waves me still.
    Go on. I'll follow thee.
  Mar. You
 shall not go, my lord.
  Ham. Hold off your hands!
  Hor. Be rul'd. You shall not go.
  Ham. My 
fate cries out
    And makes each petty artire in this body
    As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerv
e.
                                                [Ghost beckons.]

    Still am I call'd. Unhan
d me, gentlemen.
    By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!-
    I say, away!- Go on. I
'll follow thee.
                                        Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet.
  Hor. He waxes 
desperate with imagination.
  Mar. Let's follow. 'Tis not fit thus to obey him.
  Hor. Have after.
 To what issue will this come?
  Mar. Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
  Hor. Heaven w
ill direct it.
  Mar. Nay, let's follow him.
                                                     
    Exeunt.




Scene V.
Elsinore. The Castle. Another part of the fortifications.

Enter Gh
ost and Hamlet.

  Ham. Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak! I'll go no further.
  Ghost. Mark me.

  Ham. I will.
  Ghost. My hour is almost come,
    When I to sulph'rous and tormenting flames
  
  Must render up myself.
  Ham. Alas, poor ghost!
  Ghost. Pity me not, but lend thy serious heari
ng
    To what I shall unfold.
  Ham. Speak. I am bound to hear.
  Ghost. So art thou to revenge,
 when thou shalt hear.
  Ham. What?
  Ghost. I am thy father's spirit,
    Doom'd for a certain t
erm to walk the night,
    And for the day confin'd to fast in fires,
    Till the foul crimes don
e in my days of nature
    Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid
    To tell the secrets
 of my prison house,
    I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
    Would harrow up thy soul, f
reeze thy young blood,
    Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
    Thy knotte
d and combined locks to part,
    And each particular hair to stand on end
    Like quills upon th
e fretful porcupine.
    But this eternal blazon must not be
    To ears of flesh and blood. List,
 list, O, list!
    If thou didst ever thy dear father love-
  Ham. O God!
  Ghost. Revenge his f
oul and most unnatural murther.
  Ham. Murther?
  Ghost. Murther most foul, as in the best it is;

    But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.
  Ham. Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as s
wift
    As meditation or the thoughts of love,
    May sweep to my revenge.
  Ghost. I find thee
 apt;
    And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
    That rots itself in ease on Lethe whar
f,
    Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.
    'Tis given out that, sleeping in my o
rchard,
    A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark
    Is by a forged process of my death

    Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth,
    The serpent that did sting thy father's life

    Now wears his crown.
  Ham. O my prophetic soul!
    My uncle?
  Ghost. Ay, that incestuous, 
that adulterate beast,
    With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts-
    O wicked wit and
 gifts, that have the power
    So to seduce!- won to his shameful lust
    The will of my most se
eming-virtuous queen.
    O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there,
    From me, whose love was of t
hat dignity
    That it went hand in hand even with the vow
    I made to her in marriage, and to 
decline
    Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
    To those of mine!
    But virtue, as 
it never will be mov'd,
    Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
    So lust, though to 
a radiant angel link'd,
    Will sate itself in a celestial bed
    And prey on garbage.
    But 
soft! methinks I scent the morning air.
    Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
    My cu
stom always of the afternoon,
    Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
    With juice of cursed he
bona in a vial,
    And in the porches of my ears did pour
    The leperous distilment; whose effe
ct
    Holds such an enmity with blood of man
    That swift as quicksilver it courses through
  
  The natural gates and alleys of the body,
    And with a sudden vigour it doth posset
    And cu
rd, like eager droppings into milk,
    The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine;
    And a mo
st instant tetter bark'd about,
    Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust
    All my smoo
th body.
    Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
    Of life, of crown, of queen, at once di
spatch'd;
    Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
    Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd,
   
 No reckoning made, but sent to my account
    With all my imperfections on my head.
  Ham. O, hor
rible! O, horrible! most horrible!
  Ghost. If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.
    Let not 
the royal bed of Denmark be
    A couch for luxury and damned incest.
    But, howsoever thou purs
uest this act,
    Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
    Against thy mother aught. Lea
ve her to heaven,
    And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge
    To prick and sting her. Fare
 thee well at once.
    The glowworm shows the matin to be near
    And gins to pale his uneffectu
al fire.
    Adieu, adieu, adieu! Remember me.                      Exit.

  Ham. O all you host 
of heaven! O earth! What else?
    And shall I couple hell? Hold, hold, my heart!
    And you, my 
sinews, grow not instant old,
    But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?
    Ay, thou poor ghost, 
while memory holds a seat
    In this distracted globe. Remember thee?
    Yea, from the table of 
my memory
    I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
    All saws of books, all forms, all press
ures past
    That youth and observation copied there,
    And thy commandment all alone shall liv
e
    Within the book and volume of my brain,
    Unmix'd with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!
    
O most pernicious woman!
    O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
    My tables! Meet it i
s I set it down
    That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
    At least I am sure it may
 be so in Denmark.        [Writes.]
    So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word:
    It is 'Adieu
, adieu! Remember me.'
    I have sworn't.
  Hor. (within) My lord, my lord!

                  
 Enter Horatio and Marcellus.

  Mar. Lord Hamlet!
  Hor. Heaven secure him!
  Ham. So be it!
 
 Mar. Illo, ho, ho, my lord!
  Ham. Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.
  Mar. How is't, my nobl
e lord?
  Hor. What news, my lord?
  Mar. O, wonderful!
  Hor. Good my lord, tell it.
  Ham. No,
 you will reveal it.
  Hor. Not I, my lord, by heaven!
  Mar. Nor I, my lord.
  Ham. How say you 
then? Would heart of man once think it?
    But you'll be secret?
  Both. Ay, by heaven, my lord.

  Ham. There's neer a villain dwelling in all Denmark
    But he's an arrant knave.
  Hor. There 
needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
    To tell us this.
  Ham. Why, right! You are in th
e right!
    And so, without more circumstance at all,
    I hold it fit that we shake hands and p
art;
    You, as your business and desires shall point you,
    For every man hath business and de
sire,
    Such as it is; and for my own poor part,
    Look you, I'll go pray.
  Hor. These are b
ut wild and whirling words, my lord.
  Ham. I am sorry they offend you, heartily;
    Yes, faith, 
heartily.
  Hor. There's no offence, my lord.
  Ham. Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,

    And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
    It is an honest ghost, that let me tell 
you.
    For your desire to know what is between us,
    O'ermaster't as you may. And now, good fr
iends,
    As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,
    Give me one poor request.
  Hor. What 
is't, my lord? We will.
  Ham. Never make known what you have seen to-night.
  Both. My lord, we w
ill not.
  Ham. Nay, but swear't.
  Hor. In faith,
    My lord, not I.
  Mar. Nor I, my lord- in
 faith.
  Ham. Upon my sword.
  Mar. We have sworn, my lord, already.
  Ham. Indeed, upon my swor
d, indeed.

                 Ghost cries under the stage.

  Ghost. Swear.
  Ham. Aha boy, say'
st thou so? Art thou there, truepenny?
    Come on! You hear this fellow in the cellarage.
    Con
sent to swear.
  Hor. Propose the oath, my lord.
  Ham. Never to speak of this that you have seen.

    Swear by my sword.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
  Ham. Hic et ubique? Then we'll shift our grou
nd.
    Come hither, gentlemen,
    And lay your hands again upon my sword.
    Never to speak of
 this that you have heard:
    Swear by my sword.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear by his sword.
  Ham. W
ell said, old mole! Canst work i' th' earth so fast?
    A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good fr
iends."
  Hor. O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
  Ham. And therefore as a stranger g
ive it welcome.
    There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
    Than are dreamt of in 
your philosophy.
    But come!
    Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
    How strange or 
odd soe'er I bear myself
    (As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
    To put an antic dispos
ition on),
    That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
    With arms encumb'red thus, or t
his head-shake,
    Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
    As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'W
e could, an if we would,'
    Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'
    Or su
ch ambiguous giving out, to note
    That you know aught of me- this is not to do,
    So grace an
d mercy at your most need help you,
    Swear.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
                        
                           [They swear.]
  Ham. Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! So, gentlemen,
    W
ith all my love I do commend me to you;
    And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
    May do t' expr
ess his love and friending to you,
    God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;
    And
 still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
    The time is out of joint. O cursed spite
    That ev
er I was born to set it right!
    Nay, come, let's go together.
                                 
                        Exeunt.

Act II. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the house
 of Polonius.

Enter Polonius and Reynaldo.

  Pol. Give him this money and these notes, Reynald
o.
  Rey. I will, my lord.
  Pol. You shall do marvell's wisely, good Reynaldo,
    Before You vi
sit him, to make inquire
    Of his behaviour.
  Rey. My lord, I did intend it.
  Pol. Marry, wel
l said, very well said. Look you, sir,
    Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
    And ho
w, and who, what means, and where they keep,
    What company, at what expense; and finding
    By
 this encompassment and drift of question
    That they do know my son, come you more nearer
    T
han your particular demands will touch it.
    Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;

    As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
    And in part him.' Do you mark this, Reynaldo?

  Rey. Ay, very well, my lord.
  Pol. 'And in part him, but,' you may say, 'not well.
    But if
't be he I mean, he's very wild
    Addicted so and so'; and there put on him
    What forgeries y
ou please; marry, none so rank
    As may dishonour him- take heed of that;
    But, sir, such wan
ton, wild, and usual slips
    As are companions noted and most known
    To youth and liberty.
 
 Rey. As gaming, my lord.
  Pol. Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
    Drabbing. Yo
u may go so far.
  Rey. My lord, that would dishonour him.
  Pol. Faith, no, as you may season it 
in the charge.
    You must not put another scandal on him,
    That he is open to incontinency.

    That's not my meaning. But breathe his faults so quaintly
    That they may seem the taints of 
liberty,
    The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
    A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
    O
f general assault.
  Rey. But, my good lord-
  Pol. Wherefore should you do this?
  Rey. Ay, my l
ord,
    I would know that.
  Pol. Marry, sir, here's my drift,
    And I believe it is a fetch o
f warrant.
    You laying these slight sullies on my son
    As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' 
th' working,
    Mark you,
    Your party in converse, him you would sound,
    Having ever seen 
in the prenominate crimes
    The youth you breathe of guilty, be assur'd
    He closes with you i
n this consequence:
    'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman'-
    According to the phras
e or the addition
    Of man and country-
  Rey. Very good, my lord.
  Pol. And then, sir, does '
a this- 'a does- What was I about to
say?
    By the mass, I was about to say something! Where did
 I leave?
  Rey. At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,' and
    gentleman.'
  Pol. At
 'closes in the consequence'- Ay, marry!
    He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman.
    I saw him 
yesterday, or t'other day,
    Or then, or then, with such or such; and, as you say,
    There was
 'a gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
    There falling out at tennis'; or perchance,
    'I saw 
him enter such a house of sale,'
    Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
    See you now-
    Your
 bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth;
    And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
    With w
indlasses and with assays of bias,
    By indirections find directions out.
    So, by my former l
ecture and advice,
    Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?
  Rey. My lord, I have.
  Pol
. God b' wi' ye, fare ye well!
  Rey. Good my lord!                                    [Going.]
  
Pol. Observe his inclination in yourself.
  Rey. I shall, my lord.
  Pol. And let him ply his musi
c.
  Rey. Well, my lord.
  Pol. Farewell!
                                                  Exit 
Reynaldo.

                       Enter Ophelia.

    How now, Ophelia? What's the matter?
  Op
h. O my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
  Pol. With what, i' th' name of God?
  Oph. My 
lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
    Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac'd,
    No hat upo
n his head, his stockings foul'd,
    Ungart'red, and down-gyved to his ankle;
    Pale as his shi
rt, his knees knocking each other,
    And with a look so piteous in purport
    As if he had been
 loosed out of hell
    To speak of horrors- he comes before me.
  Pol. Mad for thy love?
  Oph. 
My lord, I do not know,
    But truly I do fear it.
  Pol. What said he?
  Oph. He took me by the
 wrist and held me hard;
    Then goes he to the length of all his arm,
    And, with his other ha
nd thus o'er his brow,
    He falls to such perusal of my face
    As he would draw it. Long stay'
d he so.
    At last, a little shaking of mine arm,
    And thrice his head thus waving up and dow
n,
    He rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound
    As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
    An
d end his being. That done, he lets me go,
    And with his head over his shoulder turn'd
    He s
eem'd to find his way without his eyes,
    For out o' doors he went without their help
    And to
 the last bended their light on me.
  Pol. Come, go with me. I will go seek the King.
    This is 
the very ecstasy of love,
    Whose violent property fordoes itself
    And leads the will to desp
erate undertakings
    As oft as any passion under heaven
    That does afflict our natures. I am 
sorry.
    What, have you given him any hard words of late?
  Oph. No, my good lord; but, as you d
id command,
    I did repel his letters and denied
    His access to me.
  Pol. That hath made hi
m mad.
    I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
    I had not quoted him. I fear'd he did
 but trifle
    And meant to wrack thee; but beshrew my jealousy!
    By heaven, it is as proper t
o our age
    To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
    As it is common for the younger sort
 
   To lack discretion. Come, go we to the King.
    This must be known; which, being kept close, mi
ght move
    More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
    Come.
                              
                           Exeunt.

Scene II.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Flourish. [Enter
 King and Queen, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern,
cum aliis.

  King. Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and 
Guildenstern.
    Moreover that we much did long to see you,
    The need we have to use you did p
rovoke
    Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
    Of Hamlet's transformation. So I call i
t,
    Sith nor th' exterior nor the inward man
    Resembles that it was. What it should be,
   
 More than his father's death, that thus hath put him
    So much from th' understanding of himself
,
    I cannot dream of. I entreat you both
    That, being of so young days brought up with him,

    And since so neighbour'd to his youth and haviour,
    That you vouchsafe your rest here in ou
r court
    Some little time; so by your companies
    To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather

    So much as from occasion you may glean,
    Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus
   
 That, open'd, lies within our remedy.
  Queen. Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,
    An
d sure I am two men there are not living
    To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
    To
 show us so much gentry and good will
    As to expend your time with us awhile
    For the supply
 and profit of our hope,
    Your visitation shall receive such thanks
    As fits a king's rememb
rance.
  Ros. Both your Majesties
    Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
    Put your 
dread pleasures more into command
    Than to entreaty.
  Guil. But we both obey,
    And here gi
ve up ourselves, in the full bent,
    To lay our service freely at your feet,
    To be commanded
.
  King. Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
  Queen. Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Ro
sencrantz.
    And I beseech you instantly to visit
    My too much changed son.- Go, some of you,

    And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
  Guil. Heavens make our presence and our practice
s
    Pleasant and helpful to him!
  Queen. Ay, amen!
                 Exeunt Rosencrantz and Gui
ldenstern, [with some
                                                    Attendants].

         
                Enter Polonius.

  Pol. Th' ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
    Are joyful
ly return'd.
  King. Thou still hast been the father of good news.
  Pol. Have I, my lord? Assure 
you, my good liege,
    I hold my duty as I hold my soul,
    Both to my God and to my gracious ki
ng;
    And I do think- or else this brain of mine
    Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
    
As it hath us'd to do- that I have found
    The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
  King. O, speak o
f that! That do I long to hear.
  Pol. Give first admittance to th' ambassadors.
    My news shall
 be the fruit to that great feast.
  King. Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
          
                                      [Exit Polonius.]
    He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath f
ound
    The head and source of all your son's distemper.
  Queen. I doubt it is no other but the 
main,
    His father's death and our o'erhasty marriage.
  King. Well, we shall sift him.

     
         Enter Polonius, Voltemand, and Cornelius.

    Welcome, my good friends.
    Say, Voltem
and, what from our brother Norway?
  Volt. Most fair return of greetings and desires.
    Upon our
 first, he sent out to suppress
    His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
    To be a prepara
tion 'gainst the Polack,
    But better look'd into, he truly found
    It was against your Highne
ss; whereat griev'd,
    That so his sickness, age, and impotence
    Was falsely borne in hand, s
ends out arrests
    On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys,
    Receives rebuke from Norway, an
d, in fine,
    Makes vow before his uncle never more
    To give th' assay of arms against your M
ajesty.
    Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
    Gives him three thousand crowns in annual f
ee
    And his commission to employ those soldiers,
    So levied as before, against the Polack;

    With an entreaty, herein further shown,
                                                [Gives 
a paper.]
    That it might please you to give quiet pass
    Through your dominions for this ente
rprise,
    On such regards of safety and allowance
    As therein are set down.
  King. It likes
 us well;
    And at our more consider'd time we'll read,
    Answer, and think upon this business
.
    Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour.
    Go to your rest; at night we'll feast t
ogether.
    Most welcome home!                       Exeunt Ambassadors.
  Pol. This business is 
well ended.
    My liege, and madam, to expostulate
    What majesty should be, what duty is,
   
 Why day is day, night is night, and time is time.
    Were nothing but to waste night, day, and ti
me.
    Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
    And tediousness the limbs and outward flo
urishes,
    I will be brief. Your noble son is mad.
    Mad call I it; for, to define true madnes
s,
    What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
    But let that go.
  Queen. More matter, with 
less art.
  Pol. Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
    That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis
 pity;
    And pity 'tis 'tis true. A foolish figure!
    But farewell it, for I will use no art.

    Mad let us grant him then. And now remains
    That we find out the cause of this effect-
   
 Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
    For this effect defective comes by cause.
    Thus i
t remains, and the remainder thus.
    Perpend.
    I have a daughter (have while she is mine),
 
   Who in her duty and obedience, mark,
    Hath given me this. Now gather, and surmise.
         
                                    [Reads] the letter.
    'To the celestial, and my soul's idol, 
the most beautified
      Ophelia,'-

    That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is a 
vile
      phrase.
    But you shall hear. Thus:
                                                
        [Reads.]
    'In her excellent white bosom, these, &c.'
  Queen. Came this from Hamlet to 
her?
  Pol. Good madam, stay awhile. I will be faithful.     [Reads.]


          'Doubt thou th
e stars are fire;
            Doubt that the sun doth move;
          Doubt truth to be a liar;
 
           But never doubt I love.
      'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers; I have not art

to
    reckon my groans; but that I love thee best, O most best,
believe
    it. Adieu.
      
'Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to
him,

HAMLET.'

    This, in obedien
ce, hath my daughter shown me;
    And more above, hath his solicitings,
    As they fell out by t
ime, by means, and place,
    All given to mine ear.
  King. But how hath she
    Receiv'd his lo
ve?
  Pol. What do you think of me?
  King. As of a man faithful and honourable.
  Pol. I would f
ain prove so. But what might you think,
    When I had seen this hot love on the wing
    (As I pe
rceiv'd it, I must tell you that,
    Before my daughter told me), what might you,
    Or my dear 
Majesty your queen here, think,
    If I had play'd the desk or table book,
    Or given my heart 
a winking, mute and dumb,
    Or look'd upon this love with idle sight?
    What might you think? 
No, I went round to work
    And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
    'Lord Hamlet is a princ
e, out of thy star.
    This must not be.' And then I prescripts gave her,
    That she should loc
k herself from his resort,
    Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
    Which done, she took th
e fruits of my advice,
    And he, repulsed, a short tale to make,
    Fell into a sadness, then i
nto a fast,
    Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
    Thence to a lightness, and, by this
 declension,
    Into the madness wherein now he raves,
    And all we mourn for.
  King. Do you 
think 'tis this?
  Queen. it may be, very like.
  Pol. Hath there been such a time- I would fain k
now that-
    That I have Positively said ''Tis so,'
    When it prov'd otherwise.?
  King. Not t
hat I know.
  Pol. [points to his head and shoulder] Take this from this, if
this
      be otherw
ise.
    If circumstances lead me, I will find
    Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed

    Within the centre.
  King. How may we try it further?
  Pol. You know sometimes he walks for h
ours together
    Here in the lobby.
  Queen. So he does indeed.
  Pol. At such a time I'll loose
 my daughter to him.
    Be you and I behind an arras then.
    Mark the encounter. If he love her
 not,
    And he not from his reason fall'n thereon
    Let me be no assistant for a state,
    B
ut keep a farm and carters.
  King. We will try it.

                 Enter Hamlet, reading on a 
book.

  Queen. But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
  Pol. Away, I do beseech you
, both away
    I'll board him presently. O, give me leave.
                       Exeunt King and
 Queen, [with Attendants].
    How does my good Lord Hamlet?
  Ham. Well, God-a-mercy.
  Pol. Do 
you know me, my lord?
  Ham. Excellent well. You are a fishmonger.
  Pol. Not I, my lord.
  Ham. 
Then I would you were so honest a man.
  Pol. Honest, my lord?
  Ham. Ay, sir. To be honest, as th
is world goes, is to be one
man
    pick'd out of ten thousand.
  Pol. That's very true, my lord.

  Ham. For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god
    kissing carrion- Have you a da
ughter?
  Pol. I have, my lord.
  Ham. Let her not walk i' th' sun. Conception is a blessing, but

not
    as your daughter may conceive. Friend, look to't.
  Pol. [aside] How say you by that? Sti
ll harping on my daughter.
Yet
    he knew me not at first. He said I was a fishmonger. He is
far

    gone, far gone! And truly in my youth I suff'red much
extremity
    for love- very near this
. I'll speak to him again.- What do
you
    read, my lord?
  Ham. Words, words, words.
  Pol. Wh
at is the matter, my lord?
  Ham. Between who?
  Pol. I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.

  Ham. Slanders, sir; for the satirical rogue says here that old
men
    have grey beards; that th
eir faces are wrinkled; their eyes
    purging thick amber and plum-tree gum; and that they have a

    plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams. All
which,
    sir, though I most powerf
ully and potently believe, yet I
hold it
    not honesty to have it thus set down; for you yoursel
f, sir,
    should be old as I am if, like a crab, you could go backward.

  Pol. [aside] Though 
this be madness, yet there is a method
in't.-
   Will You walk out of the air, my lord?
  Ham. In
to my grave?
  Pol. Indeed, that is out o' th' air. [Aside] How pregnant
sometimes
    his replie
s are! a happiness that often madness hits on,
which
    reason and sanity could not so prosperous
ly be delivered of.
I
    will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting
between
    
him and my daughter.- My honourable lord, I will most humbly
take
    my leave of you.
  Ham. You
 cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more
    willingly part withal- except my life, exc
ept my life, except
my
    life,

                    Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  P
ol. Fare you well, my lord.
  Ham. These tedious old fools!
  Pol. You go to seek the Lord Hamlet.
 There he is.
  Ros. [to Polonius] God save you, sir!
                                            
    Exit [Polonius].

  Guil. My honour'd lord!
  Ros. My most dear lord!
  Ham. My excellent go
od friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern?
Ah,
    Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
  Ros. A
s the indifferent children of the earth.
  Guil. Happy in that we are not over-happy.
    On Fortu
ne's cap we are not the very button.
  Ham. Nor the soles of her shoe?
  Ros. Neither, my lord.
 
 Ham. Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her
    favours?
  Guil. Faith, her priva
tes we.
  Ham. In the secret parts of Fortune? O! most true! she is a
    strumpet. What news ?
 
 Ros. None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
  Ham. Then is doomsday near! But your news
 is not true. Let me
    question more in particular. What have you, my good friends,
    deserved
 at the hands of Fortune that she sends you to prison
    hither?
  Guil. Prison, my lord?
  Ham.
 Denmark's a prison.
  Ros. Then is the world one.
  Ham. A goodly one; in which there are many co
nfines, wards, and
    dungeons, Denmark being one o' th' worst.
  Ros. We think not so, my lord.

  Ham. Why, then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either
good
    or bad but thinking makes
 it so. To me it is a prison.
  Ros. Why, then your ambition makes it one. 'Tis too narrow for
you
r
    mind.
  Ham. O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a
    king of infinit
e space, were it not that I have bad dreams.
  Guil. Which dreams indeed are ambition; for the very
 substance
of
    the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
  Ham. A dream itself is but a s
hadow.
  Ros. Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality
that
    it is but a shad
ow's shadow.
  Ham. Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and
outstretch'd
    heroes the
 beggars' shadows. Shall we to th' court? for, by
my
    fay, I cannot reason.
  Both. We'll wait
 upon you.
  Ham. No such matter! I will not sort you with the rest of my
    servants; for, to sp
eak to you like an honest man, I am most
    dreadfully attended. But in the beaten way of friendsh
ip,
what
    make you at Elsinore?
  Ros. To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
  Ham. Begga
r that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank
you;
    and sure, dear friends, my thanks are 
too dear a halfpenny.
Were
    you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free
    visit
ation? Come, deal justly with me. Come, come! Nay,
speak.
  Guil. What should we say, my lord?
  
Ham. Why, anything- but to th' purpose. You were sent for; and
    there is a kind of confession in
 your looks, which your
modesties
    have not craft enough to colour. I know the good King and
Q
ueen
    have sent for you.
  Ros. To what end, my lord?
  Ham. That you must teach me. But let m
e conjure you by the
rights
    of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the
    obl
igation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear
a
    better proposer could charge you w
ithal, be even and direct
with
    me, whether you were sent for or no.
  Ros. [aside to Guildens
tern] What say you?
  Ham. [aside] Nay then, I have an eye of you.- If you love me,
hold
    not 
off.
  Guil. My lord, we were sent for.
  Ham. I will tell you why. So shall my anticipation preve
nt your
    discovery, and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no
    feather. I have of late
- but wherefore I know not- lost all
my
    mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it
 goes
so
    heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the
earth,
    seems to me a st
erile promontory; this most excellent canopy,
the
    air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmam
ent, this
majestical
    roof fretted with golden fire- why, it appeareth no other
thing
    to 
me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What
a
    piece of work is a man! how noble
 in reason! how infinite in
    faculties! in form and moving how express and admirable! in
    ac
tion how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the
    beauty of the world, the paragon of
 animals! And yet to me
what
    is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me- no, nor
woman

    neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.
  Ros. My lord, there was no such stuff i
n my thoughts.
  Ham. Why did you laugh then, when I said 'Man delights not me'?
  Ros. To think, 
my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten
    entertainment the players shall receive from yo
u. We coted
them
    on the way, and hither are they coming to offer you service.
  Ham. He that 
plays the king shall be welcome- his Majesty shall
    have tribute of me; the adventurous knight s
hall use his foil
and
    target; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humorous man
shall
    en
d his part in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose
    lungs are tickle o' th' sere; and t
he lady shall say her mind
    freely, or the blank verse shall halt for't. What players are
    t
hey?
  Ros. Even those you were wont to take such delight in, the
    tragedians of the city.
  H
am. How chances it they travel? Their residence, both in
    reputation and profit, was better both
 ways.
  Ros. I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late
    innovation.
  Ham. Do t
hey hold the same estimation they did when I was in
the
    city? Are they so follow'd?
  Ros. No
 indeed are they not.
  Ham. How comes it? Do they grow rusty?
  Ros. Nay, their endeavour keeps i
n the wonted pace; but there
is,
    sir, an eyrie of children, little eyases, that cry out on the

top
    of question and are most tyrannically clapp'd for't. These
are now
    the fashion, and
 so berattle the common stages (so they call
    them) that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goos
equills and
    dare scarce come thither.
  Ham. What, are they children? Who maintains 'em? How a
re they
    escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can
    sing? Will they not 
say afterwards, if they should grow
    themselves to common players (as it is most like, if their

means
    are no better), their writers do them wrong to make them
exclaim
    against their own
 succession.
  Ros. Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the
nation
    holds it n
o sin to tarre them to controversy. There was, for
a
    while, no money bid for argument unless t
he poet and the
player
    went to cuffs in the question.
  Ham. Is't possible?
  Guil. O, there
 has been much throwing about of brains.
  Ham. Do the boys carry it away?
  Ros. Ay, that they do
, my lord- Hercules and his load too.
  Ham. It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmar
k,
and
    those that would make mows at him while my father lived give
    twenty, forty, fifty,
 a hundred ducats apiece for his picture
in
    little. 'Sblood, there is something in this more t
han
natural, if
    philosophy could find it out.

                     Flourish for the Players
.

  Guil. There are the players.
  Ham. Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come
!
Th'
    appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me
comply
    with you in this ga
rb, lest my extent to the players (which I
    tell you must show fairly outwards) should more appe
ar like
    entertainment than yours. You are welcome. But my
uncle-father
    and aunt-mother ar
e deceiv'd.
  Guil. In what, my dear lord?
  Ham. I am but mad north-north-west. When the wind is 
southerly
I
    know a hawk from a handsaw.

                            Enter Polonius.

  Po
l. Well be with you, gentlemen!
  Ham. Hark you, Guildenstern- and you too- at each ear a hearer!

    That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling
    clouts.
  Ros. Happily he's 
the second time come to them; for they say an
old
    man is twice a child.
  Ham. I will prophes
y he comes to tell me of the players. Mark
it.-
   You say right, sir; a Monday morning; twas so i
ndeed.
  Pol. My lord, I have news to tell you.
  Ham. My lord, I have news to tell you. When Rosc
ius was an
actor in
    Rome-
  Pol. The actors are come hither, my lord.
  Ham. Buzz, buzz!
  
Pol. Upon my honour-
  Ham. Then came each actor on his ass-
  Pol. The best actors in the world, 
either for tragedy, comedy,
    history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral,
    trag
ical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral;
scene
    individable, or poem unlimited. S
eneca cannot be too heavy,
nor
    Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these

are
    the only men.
  Ham. O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
  Pol. What
 treasure had he, my lord?
  Ham. Why,

         'One fair daughter, and no more,
           The
 which he loved passing well.'

  Pol. [aside] Still on my daughter.
  Ham. Am I not i' th' right
, old Jephthah?
  Pol. If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I
    love passing
 well.
  Ham. Nay, that follows not.
  Pol. What follows then, my lord?
  Ham. Why,

          
 'As by lot, God wot,'

 and then, you know,

           'It came to pass, as most like it was.'


    The first row of the pious chanson will show you more; for
look
    where my abridgment co
mes.

                     Enter four or five Players.

    You are welcome, masters; welcome, a
ll.- I am glad to see
thee
    well.- Welcome, good friends.- O, my old friend? Why, thy
face is

    valanc'd since I saw thee last. Com'st' thou to' beard me in
    Denmark?- What, my young lady
 and mistress? By'r Lady, your
    ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last by the
  
  altitude of a chopine. Pray God your voice, like a piece of
    uncurrent gold, be not crack'd wi
thin the ring.- Masters, you
are
    all welcome. We'll e'en to't like French falconers, fly at
 
   anything we see. We'll have a speech straight. Come, give us
a
    taste of your quality. Come,
 a passionate speech.
  1. Play. What speech, my good lord?
  Ham. I heard thee speak me a speech 
once, but it was never
acted;
    or if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember,
pleas'd

    not the million, 'twas caviary to the general; but it was (as
I
    receiv'd it, and others,
 whose judgments in such matters
cried in
    the top of mine) an excellent play, well digested in
 the
scenes,
    set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember one said
    there were no 
sallets in the lines to make the matter
savoury,
    nor no matter in the phrase that might indict
 the author of
    affectation; but call'd it an honest method, as wholesome as
    sweet, and by 
very much more handsome than fine. One speech
in't
    I chiefly lov'd. 'Twas AEneas' tale to Dido
, and thereabout
of it
    especially where he speaks of Priam's slaughter. If it live
in
    yo
ur memory, begin at this line- let me see, let me see:

         'The rugged Pyrrhus, like th' Hyr
canian beast-'

    'Tis not so; it begins with Pyrrhus:

         'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose
 sable arms,
         Black as his purpose, did the night resemble
         When he lay couched in
 the ominous horse,
         Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd
         With herald
ry more dismal. Head to foot
         Now is be total gules, horridly trick'd
         With blood 
of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
         Bak'd and impasted with the parching streets,
     
    That lend a tyrannous and a damned light
         To their lord's murther. Roasted in wrath and
 fire,
         And thus o'ersized with coagulate gore,
         With eyes like carbuncles, the he
llish Pyrrhus
         Old grandsire Priam seeks.'

    So, proceed you.
  Pol. Fore God, my lor
d, well spoken, with good accent and good
     discretion.

  1. Play. 'Anon he finds him,
     
 Striking too short at Greeks. His antique sword,
      Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,

      Repugnant to command. Unequal match'd,
      Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide;

      But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
      Th' unnerved father falls. Then sensele
ss Ilium,
      Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
      Stoops to his base, and with a h
ideous crash
      Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear. For lo! his sword,
      Which was declining on th
e milky head
      Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' th' air to stick.
      So, as a painted tyrant, P
yrrhus stood,
      And, like a neutral to his will and matter,
      Did nothing.
      But, as 
we often see, against some storm,
      A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
      The 
bold winds speechless, and the orb below
      As hush as death- anon the dreadful thunder
      D
oth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
      Aroused vengeance sets him new awork;
      A
nd never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
      On Mars's armour, forg'd for proof eterne,
      With
 less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
      Now falls on Priam.
      Out, out, thou strumpet
 Fortune! All you gods,
      In general synod take away her power;
      Break all the spokes and
 fellies from her wheel,
      And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
      As low as to
 the fiends!

  Pol. This is too long.
  Ham. It shall to the barber's, with your beard.- Prithee
 say
on.
    He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps. Say on;
come to
    Hecuba.

  
1. Play. 'But who, O who, had seen the mobled queen-'

  Ham. 'The mobled queen'?
  Pol. That's g
ood! 'Mobled queen' is good.

  1. Play. 'Run barefoot up and down, threat'ning the flames
      
With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head
      Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
     
 About her lank and all o'erteemed loins,
      A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up-
      W
ho this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd
      'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have pro
nounc'd.
      But if the gods themselves did see her then,
      When she saw Pyrrhus make malici
ous sport
      In Mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,
      The instant burst of clamour 
that she made
      (Unless things mortal move them not at all)
      Would have made milch the bu
rning eyes of heaven
      And passion in the gods.'

  Pol. Look, whe'r he has not turn'd his co
lour, and has tears
in's
    eyes. Prithee no more!
  Ham. 'Tis well. I'll have thee speak out th
e rest of this
soon.-
    Good my lord, will you see the players well bestow'd? Do you
    hear? 
Let them be well us'd; for they are the abstract and
brief
    chronicles of the time. After your 
death you were better have
a
    bad epitaph than their ill report while you live.
  Pol. My lord
, I will use them according to their desert.
  Ham. God's bodykins, man, much better! Use every man
 after his
    desert, and who should scape whipping? Use them after your
own
    honour and dign
ity. The less they deserve, the more merit is
in
    your bounty. Take them in.
  Pol. Come, sirs
.
  Ham. Follow him, friends. We'll hear a play to-morrow.
                 Exeunt Polonius and Pl
ayers [except the First].
    Dost thou hear me, old friend? Can you play 'The Murther of
    Gonz
ago'?
  1. Play. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need, study a
 
   speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which I would set down
and
    insert in't, could you not
?
  1. Play. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Very well. Follow that lord- and look you mock him not.
        
                                    [Exit First Player.]
    My good friends, I'll leave you till n
ight. You are welcome
to
    Elsinore.
  Ros. Good my lord!
  Ham. Ay, so, God b' wi' ye!
     
                       [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
    Now I am alone.
    O what a rogue
 and peasant slave am I!
    Is it not monstrous that this player here,
    But in a fiction, in a
 dream of passion,
    Could force his soul so to his own conceit
    That, from her working, all 
his visage wann'd,
    Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
    A broken voice, and his who
le function suiting
    With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!
    For Hecuba!
    What'
s Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
    That he should weep for her? What would he do,
    Had he th
e motive and the cue for passion
    That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
    And clea
ve the general ear with horrid speech;
    Make mad the guilty and appal the free,
    Confound th
e ignorant, and amaze indeed
    The very faculties of eyes and ears.
    Yet I,
    A dull and m
uddy-mettled rascal, peak
    Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
    And can say nothing!
 No, not for a king,
    Upon whose property and most dear life
    A damn'd defeat was made. Am I
 a coward?
    Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
    Plucks off my beard and blows it i
n my face?
    Tweaks me by th' nose? gives me the lie i' th' throat
    As deep as to the lungs? 
Who does me this, ha?
    'Swounds, I should take it! for it cannot be
    But I am pigeon-liver'd
 and lack gall
    To make oppression bitter, or ere this
    I should have fatted all the region 
kites
    With this slave's offal. Bloody bawdy villain!
    Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, 
kindless villain!
    O, vengeance!
    Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
    That I, th
e son of a dear father murther'd,
    Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
    Must (like a 
whore) unpack my heart with words
    And fall a-cursing like a very drab,
    A scullion!

e upon't! foh! About, my brain! Hum, I have heard
    That guilty creatures, sitting at a play,
  
  Have by the very cunning of the scene
    Been struck so to the soul that presently
    They hav
e proclaim'd their malefactions;
    For murther, though it have no tongue, will speak
    With mo
st miraculous organ, I'll have these Players
    Play something like the murther of my father
    
Before mine uncle. I'll observe his looks;
    I'll tent him to the quick. If he but blench,
    I
 know my course. The spirit that I have seen
    May be a devil; and the devil hath power
    T' a
ssume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
    Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
    As he is ve
ry potent with such spirits,
    Abuses me to damn me. I'll have grounds
    More relative than th
is. The play's the thing
    Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King.         Exit.

ACT III. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophel
ia, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern,
and Lords.

  King. And can you by no drift of circumstance
    G
et from him why he puts on this confusion,
    Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
    With t
urbulent and dangerous lunacy?
  Ros. He does confess he feels himself distracted,
    But from wh
at cause he will by no means speak.
  Guil. Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
    But with
 a crafty madness keeps aloof
    When we would bring him on to some confession
    Of his true st
ate.
  Queen. Did he receive you well?
  Ros. Most like a gentleman.
  Guil. But with much forcin
g of his disposition.
  Ros. Niggard of question, but of our demands
    Most free in his reply.

  Queen. Did you assay him
    To any pastime?
  Ros. Madam, it so fell out that certain players

    We o'erraught on the way. Of these we told him,
    And there did seem in him a kind of joy
  
  To hear of it. They are here about the court,
    And, as I think, they have already order
    T
his night to play before him.
  Pol. 'Tis most true;
    And he beseech'd me to entreat your Majes
ties
    To hear and see the matter.
  King. With all my heart, and it doth much content me
    T
o hear him so inclin'd.
    Good gentlemen, give him a further edge
    And drive his purpose on t
o these delights.
  Ros. We shall, my lord.
                            Exeunt Rosencrantz and Gui
ldenstern.
  King. Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
    For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,

    That he, as 'twere by accident, may here
    Affront Ophelia.
    Her father and myself (lawfu
l espials)
    Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing unseen,
    We may of their encounter frankly
 judge
    And gather by him, as he is behav'd,
    If't be th' affliction of his love, or no,
  
  That thus he suffers for.
  Queen. I shall obey you;
    And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish

    That your good beauties be the happy cause
    Of Hamlet's wildness. So shall I hope your virtu
es
    Will bring him to his wonted way again,
    To both your honours.
  Oph. Madam, I wish it 
may.
                                                   [Exit Queen.]
  Pol. Ophelia, walk you her
e.- Gracious, so please you,
    We will bestow ourselves.- [To Ophelia] Read on this book,
    Th
at show of such an exercise may colour
    Your loneliness.- We are oft to blame in this,
    'Tis
 too much prov'd, that with devotion's visage
    And pious action we do sugar o'er
    The Devil 
himself.
  King. [aside] O, 'tis too true!
    How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscienc
e!
    The harlot's cheek, beautied with plast'ring art,
    Is not more ugly to the thing that he
lps it
    Than is my deed to my most painted word.
    O heavy burthen!
  Pol. I hear him coming
. Let's withdraw, my lord.
                                      Exeunt King and Polonius].

    
                       Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. To be, or not to be- that is the question:
    Wheth
er 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
    The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
    Or to tak
e arms against a sea of troubles,
    And by opposing end them. To die- to sleep-
    No more; and
 by a sleep to say we end
    The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks
    That flesh is hei
r to. 'Tis a consummation
    Devoutly to be wish'd. To die- to sleep.
    To sleep- perchance to 
dream: ay, there's the rub!
    For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
    When we have s
huffled off this mortal coil,
    Must give us pause. There's the respect
    That makes calamity 
of so long life.
    For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
    Th' oppressor's wrong, t
he proud man's contumely,
    The pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay,
    The insolence of of
fice, and the spurns
    That patient merit of th' unworthy takes,
    When he himself might his q
uietus make
    With a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear,
    To grunt and sweat under a w
eary life,
    But that the dread of something after death-
    The undiscover'd country, from who
se bourn
    No traveller returns- puzzles the will,
    And makes us rather bear those ills we ha
ve
    Than fly to others that we know not of?
    Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
 
   And thus the native hue of resolution
    Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
    A
nd enterprises of great pith and moment
    With this regard their currents turn awry
    And lose
 the name of action.- Soft you now!
    The fair Ophelia!- Nymph, in thy orisons
    Be all my sin
s rememb'red.
  Oph. Good my lord,
    How does your honour for this many a day?
  Ham. I humbly 
thank you; well, well, well.
  Oph. My lord, I have remembrances of yours
    That I have longed l
ong to re-deliver.
    I pray you, now receive them.
  Ham. No, not I!
    I never gave you aught
.
  Oph. My honour'd lord, you know right well you did,
    And with them words of so sweet breath
 compos'd
    As made the things more rich. Their perfume lost,
    Take these again; for to the n
oble mind
    Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
    There, my lord.
  Ham. Ha, ha! Ar
e you honest?
  Oph. My lord?
  Ham. Are you fair?
  Oph. What means your lordship?
  Ham. That 
if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit
no
    discourse to your beauty.
  Oph. Coul
d beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with
honesty?
  Ham. Ay, truly; for the power of beau
ty will sooner transform
    honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty
can
    
translate beauty into his likeness. This was sometime a
paradox,
    but now the time gives it pro
of. I did love you once.
  Oph. Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
  Ham. You should not hav
e believ'd me; for virtue cannot so
    inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it. I loved

you
    not.
  Oph. I was the more deceived.
  Ham. Get thee to a nunnery! Why wouldst thou be a
 breeder of
    sinners? I am myself indifferent honest, but yet I could
accuse
    me of such th
ings that it were better my mother had not borne
me.
    I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; w
ith more offences at
my
    beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give
    the
m shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows
as I
    do, crawling between earth and 
heaven? We are arrant knaves
all;
    believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where's your

    father?
  Oph. At home, my lord.
  Ham. Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the f
ool
    nowhere but in's own house. Farewell.
  Oph. O, help him, you sweet heavens!
  Ham. If th
ou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy
dowry:
    be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as 
snow, thou shalt not
escape
    calumny. Get thee to a nunnery. Go, farewell. Or if thou wilt
   
 needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what
    monsters you make of them. To a 
nunnery, go; and quickly too.
    Farewell.
  Oph. O heavenly powers, restore him!
  Ham. I have 
heard of your paintings too, well enough. God hath
    given you one face, and you make yourselves 
another. You jig,
you
    amble, and you lisp; you nickname God's creatures and make
your
    wa
ntonness your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't! it hath
made
    me mad. I say, we will have no
 more marriages. Those that are
    married already- all but one- shall live; the rest shall keep

as
    they are. To a nunnery, go.                            Exit.
  Oph. O, what a noble mind is
 here o'erthrown!
    The courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword,
    Th' expectancy
 and rose of the fair state,
    The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
    Th' observ'd of a
ll observers- quite, quite down!
    And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
    That suck'd th
e honey of his music vows,
    Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
    Like sweet bells 
jangled, out of tune and harsh;
    That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
    Blasted wit
h ecstasy. O, woe is me
    T' have seen what I have seen, see what I see!

                   En
ter King and Polonius.

  King. Love? his affections do not that way tend;
    Nor what he spake,
 though it lack'd form a little,
    Was not like madness. There's something in his soul
    O'er 
which his melancholy sits on brood;
    And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
    Will be some
 danger; which for to prevent,
    I have in quick determination
    Thus set it down: he shall wi
th speed to England
    For the demand of our neglected tribute.
    Haply the seas, and countries
 different,
    With variable objects, shall expel
    This something-settled matter in his heart,

    Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
    From fashion of himself. What think you on
't?
  Pol. It shall do well. But yet do I believe
    The origin and commencement of his grief
  
  Sprung from neglected love.- How now, Ophelia?
    You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said.
 
   We heard it all.- My lord, do as you please;
    But if you hold it fit, after the play
    Let
 his queen mother all alone entreat him
    To show his grief. Let her be round with him;
    And 
I'll be plac'd so please you, in the ear
    Of all their conference. If she find him not,
    To 
England send him; or confine him where
    Your wisdom best shall think.
  King. It shall be so.

    Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.         Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. hall 
in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet and three of the Players.

  Ham. Speak the speech, I pray you, as 
I pronounc'd it to you,
    trippingly on the tongue. But if you mouth it, as many of our
    play
ers do, I had as live the town crier spoke my lines. Nor
do
    not saw the air too much with your
 hand, thus, but use all
    gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and (as I may say)
    whir
lwind of your passion, you must acquire and beget a
    temperance that may give it smoothness. O, 
it offends me to
the
    soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion
to
    ta
tters, to very rags, to split the cars of the groundlings,
who
    (for the most part) are capable
 of nothing but inexplicable
dumb
    shows and noise. I would have such a fellow whipp'd for
o'e
rdoing
    Termagant. It out-herods Herod. Pray you avoid it.
  Player. I warrant your honour.
  
Ham. Be not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be
your
    tutor. Suit the action to th
e word, the word to the action;
with
    this special observance, that you o'erstep not the modest
y of
    nature: for anything so overdone is from the purpose of
playing,
    whose end, both at 
the first and now, was and is, to hold, as
    'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show Virtue her 
own
feature,
    scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time
his
    form and pre
ssure. Now this overdone, or come tardy off,
though
    it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but ma
ke the judicious
    grieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance
    o'erweigh a w
hole theatre of others. O, there be players that
I
    have seen play, and heard others praise, an
d that highly (not
to
    speak it profanely), that, neither having the accent of
    Christians,
 nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have
so
    strutted and bellowed that I have thought 
some of Nature's
    journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they
imitated
    humanity 
so abominably.
  Player. I hope we have reform'd that indifferently with us,
sir.
  Ham. O, refor
m it altogether! And let those that play your
clowns
    speak no more than is set down for them. 
For there be of them
    that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren
    spectat
ors to laugh too, though in the mean time some
necessary
    question of the play be then to be co
nsidered. That's
villanous
    and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it.
Go
  
  make you ready.
                                                 Exeunt Players.

            E
nter Polonius, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.

    How now, my lord? Will the King hear this piece
 of work?
  Pol. And the Queen too, and that presently.
  Ham. Bid the players make haste, [Exit P
olonius.] Will you two
    help to hasten them?
  Both. We will, my lord.                       Ex
eunt they two.
  Ham. What, ho, Horatio!

                      Enter Horatio.

  Hor. Here, sw
eet lord, at your service.
  Ham. Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
    As e'er my conversation
 cop'd withal.
  Hor. O, my dear lord!
  Ham. Nay, do not think I flatter;
    For what advanceme
nt may I hope from thee,
    That no revenue hast but thy good spirits
    To feed and clothe thee
? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
    No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
    And crook
 the pregnant hinges of the knee
    Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
    Since my
 dear soul was mistress of her choice
    And could of men distinguish, her election
    Hath seal
'd thee for herself. For thou hast been
    As one, in suff'ring all, that suffers nothing;
    A 
man that Fortune's buffets and rewards
    Hast ta'en with equal thanks; and blest are those
    W
hose blood and judgment are so well commingled
    That they are not a pipe for Fortune's finger
 
   To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
    That is not passion's slave, and I will wear
 him
    In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
    As I do thee. Something too much of thi
s I
    There is a play to-night before the King.
    One scene of it comes near the circumstance,

    Which I have told thee, of my father's death.
    I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,

    Even with the very comment of thy soul
    Observe my uncle. If his occulted guilt
    Do not
 itself unkennel in one speech,
    It is a damned ghost that we have seen,
    And my imagination
s are as foul
    As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
    For I mine eyes will rivet to his
 face,
    And after we will both our judgments join
    In censure of his seeming.
  Hor. Well, 
my lord.
    If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
    And scape detecting, I will pa
y the theft.

    Sound a flourish. [Enter Trumpets and Kettledrums. Danish
    march. [Enter Kin
g, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz,
      Guildenstern, and other Lords attendant, with the G
uard
                       carrying torches.

  Ham. They are coming to the play. I must be idle
.
    Get you a place.
  King. How fares our cousin Hamlet?
  Ham. Excellent, i' faith; of the ch
ameleon's dish. I eat the
air,
    promise-cramm'd. You cannot feed capons so.
  King. I have not
hing with this answer, Hamlet. These words are
not
    mine.
  Ham. No, nor mine now. [To Poloniu
s] My lord, you play'd once
    i' th' university, you say?
  Pol. That did I, my lord, and was ac
counted a good actor.
  Ham. What did you enact?
  Pol. I did enact Julius Caesar; I was kill'd i'
 th' Capitol;
Brutus
    kill'd me.
  Ham. It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf

there. Be
    the players ready.
  Ros. Ay, my lord. They stay upon your patience.
  Queen. Come 
hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
  Ham. No, good mother. Here's metal more attractive.
  Pol. [t
o the King] O, ho! do you mark that?
  Ham. Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
                       
           [Sits down at Ophelia's feet.]

  Oph. No, my lord.
  Ham. I mean, my head upon your l
ap?
  Oph. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Do you think I meant country matters?
  Oph. I think nothing, my l
ord.
  Ham. That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
  Oph. What is, my lord?
  Ham. Not
hing.
  Oph. You are merry, my lord.
  Ham. Who, I?
  Oph. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. O God, your only 
jig-maker! What should a man do but be
merry?
    For look you how cheerfully my mother looks, and
 my father
died
    within 's two hours.
  Oph. Nay 'tis twice two months, my lord.
  Ham. So lo
ng? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I'll have
a
    suit of sables. O heavens! die two mon
ths ago, and not
forgotten
    yet? Then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his
life

    half a year. But, by'r Lady, he must build churches then; or
else
    shall he suffer not thin
king on, with the hobby-horse, whose

    epitaph is 'For O, for O, the hobby-horse is forgot!'


               Hautboys play. The dumb show enters.

    Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; 
the Queen embracing
    him and he her. She kneels, and makes show of protestation
    unto him. H
e takes her up, and declines his head upon her
    neck. He lays him down upon a bank of flowers. S
he, seeing
    him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his
    crown, kisses it,
 pours poison in the sleeper's ears, and
    leaves him. The Queen returns, finds the King dead, an
d makes
    passionate action. The Poisoner with some three or four
Mutes,
    comes in again, se
em to condole with her. The dead body is
    carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with gifts;
 she
    seems harsh and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts
    his love.
                 
                                        Exeunt.

  Oph. What means this, my lord?
  Ham. Marry, t
his is miching malhecho; it means mischief.
  Oph. Belike this show imports the argument of the pla
y.

                      Enter Prologue.

  Ham. We shall know by this fellow. The players cann
ot keep
counsel;
    they'll tell all.
  Oph. Will he tell us what this show meant?
  Ham. Ay, o
r any show that you'll show him. Be not you asham'd
to
    show, he'll not shame to tell you what 
it means.
  Oph. You are naught, you are naught! I'll mark the play.

    Pro. For us, and for ou
r tragedy,
      Here stooping to your clemency,
      We beg your hearing patiently.             
        [Exit.]

  Ham. Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
  Oph. 'Tis brief, my lord.
 
 Ham. As woman's love.

              Enter [two Players as] King and Queen.

    King. Full thi
rty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round
      Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
      
And thirty dozen moons with borrowed sheen
      About the world have times twelve thirties been,

      Since love our hearts, and Hymen did our hands,
      Unite comutual in most sacred bands.
 
   Queen. So many journeys may the sun and moon
      Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
 
     But woe is me! you are so sick of late,
      So far from cheer and from your former state.
 
     That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
      Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must;

      For women's fear and love holds quantity,
      In neither aught, or in extremity.
      Now
 what my love is, proof hath made you know;
      And as my love is siz'd, my fear is so.
      Wh
ere love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
      Where little fears grow great, great love gr
ows there.
    King. Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;
      My operant powers thei
r functions leave to do.
      And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
      Honour'd, belo
v'd, and haply one as kind
      For husband shalt thou-
    Queen. O, confound the rest!
      S
uch love must needs be treason in my breast.
      When second husband let me be accurst!
      No
ne wed the second but who killed the first.

  Ham. [aside] Wormwood, wormwood!

    Queen. The 
instances that second marriage move
      Are base respects of thrift, but none of love.
      A s
econd time I kill my husband dead
      When second husband kisses me in bed.
    King. I do belie
ve you think what now you speak;
      But what we do determine oft we break.
      Purpose is but
 the slave to memory,
      Of violent birth, but poor validity;
      Which now, like fruit unrip
e, sticks on the tree,
      But fall unshaken when they mellow be.
      Most necessary 'tis that
 we forget
      To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt.
      What to ourselves in passion we
 propose,
      The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
      The violence of either grief or j
oy
      Their own enactures with themselves destroy.
      Where joy most revels, grief doth most
 lament;
      Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
      This world is not for aye, nor 
'tis not strange
      That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
      For 'tis a quest
ion left us yet to prove,
      Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
      The great m
an down, you mark his favourite flies,
      The poor advanc'd makes friends of enemies;
      And
 hitherto doth love on fortune tend,
      For who not needs shall never lack a friend,
      And 
who in want a hollow friend doth try,
      Directly seasons him his enemy.
      But, orderly to 
end where I begun,
      Our wills and fates do so contrary run
      That our devices still are o
verthrown;
      Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own.
      So think thou wilt no se
cond husband wed;
      But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
    Queen. Nor earth to 
me give food, nor heaven light,
      Sport and repose lock from me day and night,
      To desper
ation turn my trust and hope,
      An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope,
      Each opposite t
hat blanks the face of joy
      Meet what I would have well, and it destroy,
      Both here and 
hence pursue me lasting strife,
      If, once a widow, ever I be wife!

  Ham. If she should bre
ak it now!

    King. 'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile.
      My spirits grow dull,
 and fain I would beguile
      The tedious day with sleep.
    Queen. Sleep rock thy brain,
    
                                                [He] sleeps.
      And never come mischance between
 us twain!
Exit.

  Ham. Madam, how like you this play?
  Queen. The lady doth protest too much,
 methinks.
  Ham. O, but she'll keep her word.
  King. Have you heard the argument? Is there no of
fence in't?
  Ham. No, no! They do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i'
th'
    world.
  King
. What do you call the play?
  Ham. 'The Mousetrap.' Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the
    
image of a murther done in Vienna. Gonzago is the duke's
name;
    his wife, Baptista. You shall s
ee anon. 'Tis a knavish piece
of
    work; but what o' that? Your Majesty, and we that have free

    souls, it touches us not. Let the gall'd jade winch; our
withers
    are unwrung.

         
                Enter Lucianus.

    This is one Lucianus, nephew to the King.
  Oph. You are as 
good as a chorus, my lord.
  Ham. I could interpret between you and your love, if I could
see
   
 the puppets dallying.
  Oph. You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
  Ham. It would cost you a groa
ning to take off my edge.
  Oph. Still better, and worse.
  Ham. So you must take your husbands.- 
Begin, murtherer. Pox,
leave
    thy damnable faces, and begin! Come, the croaking raven doth
   
 bellow for revenge.

    Luc. Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
      Con
federate season, else no creature seeing;
      Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,
  
    With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,
      Thy natural magic and dire property
 
     On wholesome life usurp immediately.
                                   Pours the poison in hi
s ears.

  Ham. He poisons him i' th' garden for's estate. His name's
Gonzago.
    The story is 
extant, and written in very choice Italian. You
    shall see anon how the murtherer gets the love 
of Gonzago's
wife.
  Oph. The King rises.
  Ham. What, frighted with false fire?
  Queen. How fa
res my lord?
  Pol. Give o'er the play.
  King. Give me some light! Away!
  All. Lights, lights, 
lights!
                              Exeunt all but Hamlet and Horatio.
  Ham.   Why, let the str
ucken deer go weep,
          The hart ungalled play;
         For some must watch, while some mus
t sleep:
          Thus runs the world away.
    Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers- if
 the rest of
my
    fortunes turn Turk with me-with two Provincial roses on my
raz'd
    shoes, 
get me a fellowship in a cry of players, sir?
  Hor. Half a share.
  Ham.   A whole one I!
      
   For thou dost know, O Damon dear,
           This realm dismantled was
         Of Jove himself
; and now reigns here
           A very, very- pajock.
  Hor. You might have rhym'd.
  Ham. O goo
d Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand
    pound! Didst perceive?
  Hor. Very well, 
my lord.
  Ham. Upon the talk of the poisoning?
  Hor. I did very well note him.
  Ham.   Aha! Co
me, some music! Come, the recorders!
         For if the King like not the comedy,
         Why th
en, belike he likes it not, perdy.
    Come, some music!

                Enter Rosencrantz and G
uildenstern.

  Guil. Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.
  Ham. Sir, a whole history.
 
 Guil. The King, sir-
  Ham. Ay, sir, what of him?
  Guil. Is in his retirement, marvellous distem
per'd.
  Ham. With drink, sir?
  Guil. No, my lord; rather with choler.
  Ham. Your wisdom should
 show itself more richer to signify this
to
    the doctor; for me to put him to his purgation wou
ld perhaps
    plunge him into far more choler.
  Guil. Good my lord, put your discourse into some
 frame, and
start
    not so wildly from my affair.
  Ham. I am tame, sir; pronounce.
  Guil. Th
e Queen, your mother, in most great affliction of
spirit
    hath sent me to you.
  Ham. You are 
welcome.
  Guil. Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right
breed.
    If it shall plea
se you to make me a wholesome answer, I will
do
    your mother's commandment; if not, your pardon
 and my return
    shall be the end of my business.
  Ham. Sir, I cannot.
  Guil. What, my lord?

  Ham. Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseas'd. But, sir,
such
    answer as I can make, y
ou shall command; or rather, as you
say,
    my mother. Therefore no more, but to the matter! My m
other,
you
    say-
  Ros. Then thus she says: your behaviour hath struck her into
    amazement
 and admiration.
  Ham. O wonderful son, that can so stonish a mother! But is
there no
    sequel
 at the heels of this mother's admiration? Impart.
  Ros. She desires to speak with you in her clos
et ere you go to
bed.
  Ham. We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any
    furth
er trade with us?
  Ros. My lord, you once did love me.
  Ham. And do still, by these pickers and 
stealers!
  Ros. Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? You do
surely
    bar the door up
on your own liberty, if you deny your griefs
to
    your friend.
  Ham. Sir, I lack advancement.

  Ros. How can that be, when you have the voice of the King
himself
    for your succession in De
nmark?
  Ham. Ay, sir, but 'while the grass grows'- the proverb is
something
    musty.

      
               Enter the Players with recorders.

    O, the recorders! Let me see one. To withdra
w with you- why
do
    you go about to recover the wind of me, as if you would drive
me
    into
 a toil?
  Guil. O my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too
unmannerly.
  Ham. I do not we
ll understand that. Will you play upon this
pipe?
  Guil. My lord, I cannot.
  Ham. I pray you.

  Guil. Believe me, I cannot.
  Ham. I do beseech you.
  Guil. I know, no touch of it, my lord.
 
 Ham. It is as easy as lying. Govern these ventages with your
    fingers and thumbs, give it breat
h with your mouth, and it
will
    discourse most eloquent music. Look you, these are the stops.

  Guil. But these cannot I command to any utt'rance of harmony. I
    have not the skill.
  Ham. W
hy, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me!
You
    would play upon me; you would seem 
to know my stops; you
would
    pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound me from my
   
 lowest note to the top of my compass; and there is much
music,
    excellent voice, in this littl
e organ, yet cannot you make it
    speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am easier to be play'd on than

a
    pipe? Call me what instrument you will, though you can fret
me,
    you cannot play upon me
.

                        Enter Polonius.

    God bless you, sir!
  Pol. My lord, the Queen w
ould speak with you, and presently.
  Ham. Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a came
l?
  Pol. By th' mass, and 'tis like a camel indeed.
  Ham. Methinks it is like a weasel.
  Pol. 
It is back'd like a weasel.
  Ham. Or like a whale.
  Pol. Very like a whale.
  Ham. Then will I 
come to my mother by-and-by.- They fool me to
the
    top of my bent.- I will come by-and-by.
  P
ol. I will say so.                                      Exit.
  Ham. 'By-and-by' is easily said.- L
eave me, friends.
                                        [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]

    'Tis now 
the very witching time of night,
    When churchyards yawn, and hell itself breathes out
    Conta
gion to this world. Now could I drink hot blood
    And do such bitter business as the day
    Wou
ld quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother!
    O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever
    Th
e soul of Nero enter this firm bosom.
    Let me be cruel, not unnatural;
    I will speak daggers
 to her, but use none.
    My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites-
    How in my words somever s
he be shent,
    To give them seals never, my soul, consent!             Exit.




Scene III.

A room in the Castle.

Enter King, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.

  King. I like him not, nor 
stands it safe with us
    To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;
    I your commission 
will forthwith dispatch,
    And he to England shall along with you.
    The terms of our estate m
ay not endure
    Hazard so near us as doth hourly grow
    Out of his lunacies.
  Guil. We will 
ourselves provide.
    Most holy and religious fear it is
    To keep those many many bodies safe

    That live and feed upon your Majesty.
  Ros. The single and peculiar life is bound
    With a
ll the strength and armour of the mind
    To keep itself from noyance; but much more
    That spi
rit upon whose weal depends and rests
    The lives of many. The cesse of majesty
    Dies not alo
ne, but like a gulf doth draw
    What's near it with it. It is a massy wheel,
    Fix'd on the su
mmit of the highest mount,
    To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
    Are mortis'd an
d adjoin'd; which when it falls,
    Each small annexment, petty consequence,
    Attends the bois
t'rous ruin. Never alone
    Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.
  King. Arm you, I pray 
you, to this speedy voyage;
    For we will fetters put upon this fear,
    Which now goes too fre
e-footed.
  Both. We will haste us.
                                               Exeunt Gentleme
n.

                   Enter Polonius.

  Pol. My lord, he's going to his mother's closet.
    
Behind the arras I'll convey myself
    To hear the process. I'll warrant she'll tax him home;
   
 And, as you said, and wisely was it said,
    'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,
  
  Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear
    The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my li
ege.
    I'll call upon you ere you go to bed
    And tell you what I know.
  King. Thanks, dear 
my lord.
                                                Exit [Polonius].
    O, my offence is ran
k, it smells to heaven;
    It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,
    A brother's murther! Pray 
can I not,
    Though inclination be as sharp as will.
    My stronger guilt defeats my strong int
ent,
    And, like a man to double business bound,
    I stand in pause where I shall first begin,

    And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
    Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,

    Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
    To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves me
rcy
    But to confront the visage of offence?
    And what's in prayer but this twofold force,
 
   To be forestalled ere we come to fall,
    Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;
    My fa
ult is past. But, O, what form of prayer
    Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murther'?
    
That cannot be; since I am still possess'd
    Of those effects for which I did the murther-
    M
y crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.
    May one be pardon'd and retain th' offence?
    In t
he corrupted currents of this world
    Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,
    And oft 't
is seen the wicked prize itself
    Buys out the law; but 'tis not so above.
    There is no shuff
ling; there the action lies
    In his true nature, and we ourselves compell'd,
    Even to the te
eth and forehead of our faults,
    To give in evidence. What then? What rests?
    Try what repen
tance can. What can it not?
    Yet what can it when one cannot repent?
    O wretched state! O bo
som black as death!
    O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
    Art more engag'd! Help, ang
els! Make assay.
    Bow, stubborn knees; and heart with strings of steel,
    Be soft as sinews o
f the new-born babe!
    All may be well.                                  He kneels.

          
               Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
    And now I'll d
o't. And so he goes to heaven,
    And so am I reveng'd. That would be scann'd.
    A villain kill
s my father; and for that,
    I, his sole son, do this same villain send
    To heaven.
    Why,
 this is hire and salary, not revenge!
    He took my father grossly, full of bread,
    With all 
his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
    And how his audit stands, who knows save heaven?
    
But in our circumstance and course of thought,
    'Tis heavy with him; and am I then reveng'd,
  
  To take him in the purging of his soul,
    When he is fit and seasoned for his passage?
    No.

    Up, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent.
    When he is drunk asleep; or in his rage;
  
  Or in th' incestuous pleasure of his bed;
    At gaming, swearing, or about some act
    That ha
s no relish of salvation in't-
    Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,
    And that 
his soul may be as damn'd and black
    As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays.
    This physic
 but prolongs thy sickly days.              Exit.
  King. [rises] My words fly up, my thoughts rema
in below.
    Words without thoughts never to heaven go.             Exit.




Scene IV.
The 
Queen's closet.

Enter Queen and Polonius.

  Pol. He will come straight. Look you lay home to h
im.
    Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,
    And that your Grace hath screen'
d and stood between
    Much heat and him. I'll silence me even here.
    Pray you be round with h
im.
  Ham. (within) Mother, mother, mother!
  Queen. I'll warrant you; fear me not. Withdraw; I he
ar him
coming.
                              [Polonius hides behind the arras.]

               
           Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Now, mother, what's the matter?
  Queen. Hamlet, thou hast thy f
ather much offended.
  Ham. Mother, you have my father much offended.
  Queen. Come, come, you ans
wer with an idle tongue.
  Ham. Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
  Queen. Why, how now, 
Hamlet?
  Ham. What's the matter now?
  Queen. Have you forgot me?
  Ham. No, by the rood, not so
!
    You are the Queen, your husband's brother's wife,
    And (would it were not so!) you are my
 mother.
  Queen. Nay, then I'll set those to you that can speak.
  Ham. Come, come, and sit you d
own. You shall not budge;
    You go not till I set you up a glass
    Where you may see the inmos
t part of you.
  Queen. What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murther me?
    Help, help, ho!
  Pol. [
behind] What, ho! help, help, help!
  Ham. [draws] How now? a rat? Dead for a ducat, dead!
       
     [Makes a pass through the arras and] kills Polonius.
  Pol. [behind] O, I am slain!
  Queen. 
O me, what hast thou done?
  Ham. Nay, I know not. Is it the King?
  Queen. O, what a rash and blo
ody deed is this!
  Ham. A bloody deed- almost as bad, good mother,
    As kill a king, and marry 
with his brother.
  Queen. As kill a king?
  Ham. Ay, lady, it was my word.
                     
    [Lifts up the arras and sees Polonius.]
    Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
   
 I took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune.
    Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.
   
 Leave wringing of your hands. Peace! sit you down
    And let me wring your heart; for so I shall

    If it be made of penetrable stuff;
    If damned custom have not braz'd it so
    That it is 
proof and bulwark against sense.
  Queen. What have I done that thou dar'st wag thy tongue
    In 
noise so rude against me?
  Ham. Such an act
    That blurs the grace and blush of modesty;
    C
alls virtue hypocrite; takes off the rose
    From the fair forehead of an innocent love,
    And 
sets a blister there; makes marriage vows
    As false as dicers' oaths. O, such a deed
    As fro
m the body of contraction plucks
    The very soul, and sweet religion makes
    A rhapsody of wor
ds! Heaven's face doth glow;
    Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
    With tristful visage, a
s against the doom,
    Is thought-sick at the act.
  Queen. Ah me, what act,
    That roars so l
oud and thunders in the index?
  Ham. Look here upon th's picture, and on this,
    The counterfei
t presentment of two brothers.
    See what a grace was seated on this brow;
    Hyperion's curls;
 the front of Jove himself;
    An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
    A station like the 
herald Mercury
    New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill:
    A combination and a form indeed
    
Where every god did seem to set his seal
    To give the world assurance of a man.
    This was yo
ur husband. Look you now what follows.
    Here is your husband, like a mildew'd ear
    Blasting 
his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
    Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
    And b
atten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes
    You cannot call it love; for at your age
    The heyday 
in the blood is tame, it's humble,
    And waits upon the judgment; and what judgment
    Would st
ep from this to this? Sense sure you have,
    Else could you not have motion; but sure that sense

    Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,
    Nor sense to ecstacy was ne'er so thrall'd
    B
ut it reserv'd some quantity of choice
    To serve in such a difference. What devil was't
    Tha
t thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
    Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
    Ear
s without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
    Or but a sickly part of one true sense
    Could n
ot so mope.
    O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
    If thou canst mutine in a matron
's bones,
    To flaming youth let virtue be as wax
    And melt in her own fire. Proclaim no sham
e
    When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
    Since frost itself as actively doth burn,

    And reason panders will.
  Queen. O Hamlet, speak no more!
    Thou turn'st mine eyes into my 
very soul,
    And there I see such black and grained spots
    As will not leave their tinct.
  
Ham. Nay, but to live
    In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
    Stew'd in corruption, honeying
 and making love
    Over the nasty sty!
  Queen. O, speak to me no more!
    These words like da
ggers enter in mine ears.
    No more, sweet Hamlet!
  Ham. A murtherer and a villain!
    A slav
e that is not twentieth part the tithe
    Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
    A cutpurse
 of the empire and the rule,
    That from a shelf the precious diadem stole
    And put it in his
 pocket!
  Queen. No more!

                Enter the Ghost in his nightgown.

  Ham. A king of
 shreds and patches!-
    Save me and hover o'er me with your wings,
    You heavenly guards! What
 would your gracious figure?
  Queen. Alas, he's mad!
  Ham. Do you not come your tardy son to chi
de,
    That, laps'd in time and passion, lets go by
    Th' important acting of your dread comman
d?
    O, say!
  Ghost. Do not forget. This visitation
    Is but to whet thy almost blunted purp
ose.
    But look, amazement on thy mother sits.
    O, step between her and her fighting soul
  
  Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works.
    Speak to her, Hamlet.
  Ham. How is it with you, 
lady?
  Queen. Alas, how is't with you,
    That you do bend your eye on vacancy,
    And with th
' encorporal air do hold discourse?
    Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
    And, as t
he sleeping soldiers in th' alarm,
    Your bedded hairs, like life in excrements,
    Start up an
d stand an end. O gentle son,
    Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
    Sprinkle cool patie
nce! Whereon do you look?
  Ham. On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!
    His form and cau
se conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
    Would make them capable.- Do not look upon me,
    Lest wit
h this piteous action you convert
    My stern effects. Then what I have to do
    Will want true 
colour- tears perchance for blood.
  Queen. To whom do you speak this?
  Ham. Do you see nothing t
here?
  Queen. Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
  Ham. Nor did you nothing hear?
  Queen. N
o, nothing but ourselves.
  Ham. Why, look you there! Look how it steals away!
    My father, in h
is habit as he liv'd!
    Look where he goes even now out at the portal!
                         
                            Exit Ghost.
  Queen. This is the very coinage of your brain.
    This 
bodiless creation ecstasy
    Is very cunning in.
  Ham. Ecstasy?
    My pulse as yours doth temp
erately keep time
    And makes as healthful music. It is not madness
    That I have utt'red. Bri
ng me to the test,
    And I the matter will reword; which madness
    Would gambol from. Mother, 
for love of grace,
    Lay not that flattering unction to your soul
    That not your trespass but
 my madness speaks.
    It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
    Whiles rank corruption, 
mining all within,
    Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
    Repent what's past; avoid w
hat is to come;
    And do not spread the compost on the weeds
    To make them ranker. Forgive me
 this my virtue;
    For in the fatness of these pursy times
    Virtue itself of vice must pardon
 beg-
    Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.
  Queen. O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart 
in twain.
  Ham. O, throw away the worser part of it,
    And live the purer with the other half,

    Good night- but go not to my uncle's bed.
    Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
    That m
onster, custom, who all sense doth eat
    Of habits evil, is angel yet in this,
    That to the u
se of actions fair and good
    He likewise gives a frock or livery,
    That aptly is put on. Ref
rain to-night,
    And that shall lend a kind of easiness
    To the next abstinence; the next mor
e easy;
    For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
    And either [master] the devil, or t
hrow him out
    With wondrous potency. Once more, good night;
    And when you are desirous to be
 blest,
    I'll blessing beg of you.- For this same lord,
    I do repent; but heaven hath pleas'
d it so,
    To punish me with this, and this with me,
    That I must be their scourge and minist
er.
    I will bestow him, and will answer well
    The death I gave him. So again, good night.
 
   I must be cruel, only to be kind;
    Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.
    One word m
ore, good lady.
  Queen. What shall I do?
  Ham. Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
    Le
t the bloat King tempt you again to bed;
    Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
    A
nd let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
    Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,
   
 Make you to ravel all this matter out,
    That I essentially am not in madness,
    But mad in c
raft. 'Twere good you let him know;
    For who that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
    Would f
rom a paddock, from a bat, a gib
    Such dear concernings hide? Who would do so?
    No, in despi
te of sense and secrecy,
    Unpeg the basket on the house's top,
    Let the birds fly, and like 
the famous ape,
    To try conclusions, in the basket creep
    And break your own neck down.
  Q
ueen. Be thou assur'd, if words be made of breath,
    And breath of life, I have no life to breath
e
    What thou hast said to me.
  Ham. I must to England; you know that?
  Queen. Alack,
    I 
had forgot! 'Tis so concluded on.
  Ham. There's letters seal'd; and my two schoolfellows,
    Who
m I will trust as I will adders fang'd,
    They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way
    And 
marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
    For 'tis the sport to have the enginer
    Hoist with his 
own petar; and 't shall go hard
    But I will delve one yard below their mines
    And blow them 
at the moon. O, 'tis most sweet
    When in one line two crafts directly meet.
    This man shall 
set me packing.
    I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.-
    Mother, good night.- Indeed, t
his counsellor
    Is now most still, most secret, and most grave,
    Who was in life a foolish p
eating knave.
    Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.
    Good night, mother.
            
      [Exit the Queen. Then] Exit Hamlet, tugging in
                                              
         Polonius.

ACT IV. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter K
ing and Queen, with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  King. There's matter in these sighs. These pr
ofound heaves
    You must translate; 'tis fit we understand them.
    Where is your son?
  Queen
. Bestow this place on us a little while.
                          [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guilden
stern.]
    Ah, mine own lord, what have I seen to-night!
  King. What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?

  Queen. Mad as the sea and wind when both contend
    Which is the mightier. In his lawless fit

    Behind the arras hearing something stir,
    Whips out his rapier, cries 'A rat, a rat!'
    
And in this brainish apprehension kills
    The unseen good old man.
  King. O heavy deed!
    It
 had been so with us, had we been there.
    His liberty is full of threats to all-
    To you you
rself, to us, to every one.
    Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
    It will be laid 
to us, whose providence
    Should have kept short, restrain'd, and out of haunt
    This mad youn
g man. But so much was our love
    We would not understand what was most fit,
    But, like the o
wner of a foul disease,
    To keep it from divulging, let it feed
    Even on the pith of life. W
here is he gone?
  Queen. To draw apart the body he hath kill'd;
    O'er whom his very madness, l
ike some ore
    Among a mineral of metals base,
    Shows itself pure. He weeps for what is done.

  King. O Gertrude, come away!
    The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch
    But we will s
hip him hence; and this vile deed
    We must with all our majesty and skill
    Both countenance 
and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!

             Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

    Friends bot
h, go join you with some further aid.
    Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
    And from his 
mother's closet hath he dragg'd him.
    Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body
    Into 
the chapel. I pray you haste in this.
                          Exeunt [Rosencrantz and Guildenster
n].
    Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends
    And let them know both what we mean t
o do
    And what's untimely done. [So haply slander-]
    Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter
,
    As level as the cannon to his blank,
    Transports his poisoned shot- may miss our name
  
  And hit the woundless air.- O, come away!
    My soul is full of discord and dismay.
           
                                              Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A passage in the
 Castle.

Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Safely stow'd.
  Gentlemen. (within) Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!
  Ha
m. But soft! What noise? Who calls on Hamlet? O, here they
come.

               Enter Rosencrant
z and Guildenstern.

  Ros. What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
  Ham. Compounded it
 with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
  Ros. Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
    And bear i
t to the chapel.
  Ham. Do not believe it.
  Ros. Believe what?
  Ham. That I can keep your couns
el, and not mine own. Besides,
to be
    demanded of a sponge, what replication should be made by 
the
son
    of a king?
  Ros. Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
  Ham. Ay, sir; that soaks up t
he King's countenance, his
rewards,
    his authorities. But such officers do the King best servic
e
in
    the end. He keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his
jaw;
    first mouth'd, to be
 last swallowed. When he needs what you
have
    glean'd, it is but squeezing you and, sponge, you
 shall be
dry
    again.
  Ros. I understand you not, my lord.
  Ham. I am glad of it. A knavish
 speech sleeps in a foolish ear.
  Ros. My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us

to
    the King.
  Ham. The body is with the King, but the King is not with the
body.
    The K
ing is a thing-
  Guil. A thing, my lord?
  Ham. Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and all af
ter.
                                                         Exeunt.




Scene III.
Elsinore
. A room in the Castle.

Enter King.

  King. I have sent to seek him and to find the body.
   
 How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
    Yet must not we put the strong law on him.
    
He's lov'd of the distracted multitude,
    Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;
    An
d where 'tis so, th' offender's scourge is weigh'd,
    But never the offence. To bear all smooth a
nd even,
    This sudden sending him away must seem
    Deliberate pause. Diseases desperate grown

    By desperate appliance are reliev'd,
    Or not at all.

                    Enter Rosencra
ntz.

    How now O What hath befall'n?
  Ros. Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
    We 
cannot get from him.
  King. But where is he?
  Ros. Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleas
ure.
  King. Bring him before us.
  Ros. Ho, Guildenstern! Bring in my lord.

        Enter Haml
et and Guildenstern [with Attendants].

  King. Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
  Ham. At supper.

  King. At supper? Where?
  Ham. Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A certain
    convocat
ion of politic worms are e'en at him. Your worm is
your
    only emperor for diet. We fat all crea
tures else to fat us,
and
    we fat ourselves for maggots. Your fat king and your lean
beggar
 
   is but variable service- two dishes, but to one table. That's
the
    end.
  King. Alas, alas!

  Ham. A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and
eat
    of the fish that hath f
ed of that worm.
  King. What dost thou mean by this?
  Ham. Nothing but to show you how a king ma
y go a progress
through
    the guts of a beggar.
  King. Where is Polonius?
  Ham. In heaven. S
end thither to see. If your messenger find him
not
    there, seek him i' th' other place yourself
. But indeed, if
you
    find him not within this month, you shall nose him as you go
up
    the
 stair, into the lobby.
  King. Go seek him there. [To Attendants.]
  Ham. He will stay till you c
ome.
                                            [Exeunt Attendants.]
  King. Hamlet, this deed, f
or thine especial safety,-
    Which we do tender as we dearly grieve
    For that which thou hast
 done,- must send thee hence
    With fiery quickness. Therefore prepare thyself.
    The bark is 
ready and the wind at help,
    Th' associates tend, and everything is bent
    For England.
  Ha
m. For England?
  King. Ay, Hamlet.
  Ham. Good.
  King. So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.

  Ham. I see a cherub that sees them. But come, for England!
    Farewell, dear mother.
  King. T
hy loving father, Hamlet.
  Ham. My mother! Father and mother is man and wife; man and wife
is
  
  one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England!
Exit.
  King. Follow him at foot; tempt him wit
h speed aboard.
    Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night.
    Away! for everything is seal'd
 and done
    That else leans on th' affair. Pray you make haste.
                            Exeu
nt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]
    And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught,-
    As my gr
eat power thereof may give thee sense,
    Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
    After the
 Danish sword, and thy free awe
    Pays homage to us,- thou mayst not coldly set
    Our sovereig
n process, which imports at full,
    By letters congruing to that effect,
    The present death o
f Hamlet. Do it, England;
    For like the hectic in my blood he rages,
    And thou must cure me.
 Till I know 'tis done,
    Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.             Exit.

Scene IV.
Near Elsinore.

Enter Fortinbras with his Army over the stage.

  For. Go,
 Captain, from me greet the Danish king.
    Tell him that by his license Fortinbras
    Craves th
e conveyance of a promis'd march
    Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.
    If that his Ma
jesty would aught with us,
    We shall express our duty in his eye;
    And let him know so.
  C
apt. I will do't, my lord.
  For. Go softly on.
                                   Exeunt [all but
 the Captain].

       Enter Hamlet, Rosencrantz, [Guildenstern,] and others.

  Ham. Good sir, 
whose powers are these?
  Capt. They are of Norway, sir.
  Ham. How purpos'd, sir, I pray you?
  
Capt. Against some part of Poland.
  Ham. Who commands them, sir?
  Capt. The nephew to old Norway
, Fortinbras.
  Ham. Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
    Or for some frontier?
  Capt. T
ruly to speak, and with no addition,
    We go to gain a little patch of ground
    That hath in i
t no profit but the name.
    To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
    Nor will it yield
 to Norway or the Pole
    A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
  Ham. Why, then the Polack ne
ver will defend it.
  Capt. Yes, it is already garrison'd.
  Ham. Two thousand souls and twenty th
ousand ducats
    Will not debate the question of this straw.
    This is th' imposthume of much w
ealth and peace,
    That inward breaks, and shows no cause without
    Why the man dies.- I humbl
y thank you, sir.
  Capt. God b' wi' you, sir.                             [Exit.]
  Ros. Will't p
lease you go, my lord?
  Ham. I'll be with you straight. Go a little before.
                     
                   [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]
    How all occasions do inform against me
    And spu
r my dull revenge! What is a man,
    If his chief good and market of his time
    Be but to sleep
 and feed? A beast, no more.
    Sure he that made us with such large discourse,
    Looking befor
e and after, gave us not
    That capability and godlike reason
    To fust in us unus'd. Now, whe
ther it be
    Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple
    Of thinking too precisely on th' event
,-
    A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
    And ever three parts coward,- I do
 not know
    Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do,'
    Sith I have cause, and will, and str
ength, and means
    To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me.
    Witness this army of such mas
s and charge,
    Led by a delicate and tender prince,
    Whose spirit, with divine ambition puff
'd,
    Makes mouths at the invisible event,
    Exposing what is mortal and unsure
    To all th
at fortune, death, and danger dare,
    Even for an eggshell. Rightly to be great
    Is not to st
ir without great argument,
    But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
    When honour's at the sta
ke. How stand I then,
    That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,
    Excitements of my reaso
n and my blood,
    And let all sleep, while to my shame I see
    The imminent death of twenty th
ousand men
    That for a fantasy and trick of fame
    Go to their graves like beds, fight for a 
plot
    Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
    Which is not tomb enough and continent
   
 To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,
    My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!       
     Exit.

Scene V.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter Horatio, Queen, a
nd a Gentleman.

  Queen. I will not speak with her.
  Gent. She is importunate, indeed distract.

    Her mood will needs be pitied.
  Queen. What would she have?
  Gent. She speaks much of her 
father; says she hears
    There's tricks i' th' world, and hems, and beats her heart;
    Spurns 
enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,
    That carry but half sense. Her speech is nothing,

    Yet the unshaped use of it doth move
    The hearers to collection; they aim at it,
    And b
otch the words up fit to their own thoughts;
    Which, as her winks and nods and gestures yield th
em,
    Indeed would make one think there might be thought,
    Though nothing sure, yet much unha
ppily.
  Hor. 'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew
    Dangerous conjectures in ill
-breeding minds.
  Queen. Let her come in.
                                               [Exit Ge
ntleman.]
    [Aside] To my sick soul (as sin's true nature is)
    Each toy seems Prologue to som
e great amiss.
    So full of artless jealousy is guilt
    It spills itself in fearing to be spil
t.

                 Enter Ophelia distracted.

  Oph. Where is the beauteous Majesty of Denmark
?
  Queen. How now, Ophelia?
  Oph. (sings)
         How should I your true-love know
          
 From another one?
         By his cockle bat and' staff
           And his sandal shoon.

  Que
en. Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
  Oph. Say you? Nay, pray You mark.

    (Sings) He
 is dead and gone, lady,
              He is dead and gone;
            At his head a grass-green 
turf,
              At his heels a stone.

    O, ho!
  Queen. Nay, but Ophelia-
  Oph. Pray yo
u mark.

    (Sings) White his shroud as the mountain snow-

                    Enter King.


  Queen. Alas, look here, my lord!
  Oph. (Sings)
           Larded all with sweet flowers;
     
    Which bewept to the grave did not go
           With true-love showers.

  King. How do you, 
pretty lady?
  Oph. Well, God dild you! They say the owl was a baker's
daughter.
    Lord, we kno
w what we are, but know not what we may be. God
be at
    your table!
  King. Conceit upon her fa
ther.
  Oph. Pray let's have no words of this; but when they ask, you
what
    it means, say you 
this:

    (Sings) To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,
              All in the morning bedtime,

            And I a maid at your window,
              To be your Valentine.

            Then u
p he rose and donn'd his clo'es
              And dupp'd the chamber door,
            Let in the 
maid, that out a maid
              Never departed more.

  King. Pretty Ophelia!
  Oph. Indeed,
 la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't!

    [Sings] By Gis and by Saint Charity,
          
    Alack, and fie for shame!
            Young men will do't if they come to't
              By C
ock, they are to blame.

            Quoth she, 'Before you tumbled me,
              You promis'
d me to wed.'

    He answers:

            'So would I 'a' done, by yonder sun,
              
An thou hadst not come to my bed.'

  King. How long hath she been thus?
  Oph. I hope all will b
e well. We must be patient; but I cannot
    choose but weep to think they would lay him i' th' col
d
ground.
    My brother shall know of it; and so I thank you for your good
    counsel. Come, my
 coach! Good night, ladies. Good night,
sweet
    ladies. Good night, good night.                 
        Exit
  King. Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.
                          
                       [Exit Horatio.]

    O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs
    A
ll from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
    When sorrows come, they come not single spies
.
    But in battalions! First, her father slain;
    Next, your son gone, and he most violent aut
hor
    Of his own just remove; the people muddied,
    Thick and and unwholesome in their thought
s and whispers
    For good Polonius' death, and we have done but greenly
    In hugger-mugger to 
inter him; poor Ophelia
    Divided from herself and her fair judgment,
    Without the which we a
re pictures or mere beasts;
    Last, and as much containing as all these,
    Her brother is in s
ecret come from France;
    And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
    Feeds on his wonder, keep,
 himself in clouds,
    With pestilent speeches of his father's death,
    Wherein necessity, of m
atter beggar'd,
    Will nothing stick our person to arraign
    In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrud
e, this,
    Like to a murd'ring piece, in many places
    Give me superfluous death.             
     A noise within.
  Queen. Alack, what noise is this?
  King. Where are my Switzers? Let them g
uard the door.

                     Enter a Messenger.

    What is the matter?
  Mess. Save Y
ourself, my lord:
    The ocean, overpeering of his list,
    Eats not the flats with more impetuo
us haste
    Than Young Laertes, in a riotous head,
    O'erbears Your offices. The rabble call hi
m lord;
    And, as the world were now but to begin,
    Antiquity forgot, custom not known,
    
The ratifiers and props of every word,
    They cry 'Choose we! Laertes shall be king!'
    Caps, 
hands, and tongues applaud it to the clouds,
    'Laertes shall be king! Laertes king!'
          
                                       A noise within.
  Queen. How cheerfully on the false trail t
hey cry!
    O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!
  King. The doors are broke.

          
          Enter Laertes with others.

  Laer. Where is this king?- Sirs, staid you all without.
 
 All. No, let's come in!
  Laer. I pray you give me leave.
  All. We will, we will!
  Laer. I tha
nk you. Keep the door.      [Exeunt his Followers.]
    O thou vile king,
    Give me my father!

  Queen. Calmly, good Laertes.
  Laer. That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard;
    Cr
ies cuckold to my father; brands the harlot
    Even here between the chaste unsmirched brows
    
Of my true mother.
  King. What is the cause, Laertes,
    That thy rebellion looks so giantlike?

    Let him go, Gertrude. Do not fear our person.
    There's such divinity doth hedge a king
   
 That treason can but peep to what it would,
    Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,
    Wh
y thou art thus incens'd. Let him go, Gertrude.
    Speak, man.
  Laer. Where is my father?
  Kin
g. Dead.
  Queen. But not by him!
  King. Let him demand his fill.
  Laer. How came he dead? I'll
 not be juggled with:
    To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil
    Conscience and grac
e, to the profoundest pit!
    I dare damnation. To this point I stand,
    That both the world, I
 give to negligence,
    Let come what comes; only I'll be reveng'd
    Most throughly for my fath
er.
  King. Who shall stay you?
  Laer. My will, not all the world!
    And for my means, I'll hu
sband them so well
    They shall go far with little.
  King. Good Laertes,
    If you desire to 
know the certainty
    Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge
    That sweepstake 
you will draw both friend and foe,
    Winner and loser?
  Laer. None but his enemies.
  King. Wi
ll you know them then?
  Laer. To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms
    And, like the ki
nd life-rend'ring pelican,
    Repast them with my blood.
  King. Why, now You speak
    Like a g
ood child and a true gentleman.
    That I am guiltless of your father's death,
    And am most se
nsibly in grief for it,
    It shall as level to your judgment pierce
    As day does to your eye.

                              A noise within: 'Let her come in.'
  Laer. How now? What noise is t
hat?

                      Enter Ophelia.

    O heat, dry up my brains! Tears seven times salt

    Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!
    By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight

    Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!
    Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
    
O heavens! is't possible a young maid's wits
    Should be as mortal as an old man's life?
    Nat
ure is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,
    It sends some precious instance of itself
    After 
the thing it loves.

  Oph. (sings)
         They bore him barefac'd on the bier
           (Hey
 non nony, nony, hey nony)
         And in his grave rain'd many a tear.

    Fare you well, my d
ove!
  Laer. Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
    It could not move thus.
  Oph. 
You must sing 'A-down a-down, and you call him a-down-a.'
O,
    how the wheel becomes it! It is t
he false steward, that stole
his
    master's daughter.
  Laer. This nothing's more than matter.

  Oph. There's rosemary, that's for remembrance. Pray you, love,
    remember. And there is pansie
s, that's for thoughts.
  Laer. A document in madness! Thoughts and remembrance fitted.
  Oph. The
re's fennel for you, and columbines. There's rue for
you,
    and here's some for me. We may call 
it herb of grace o'
Sundays.
    O, you must wear your rue with a difference! There's a daisy.
I

    would give you some violets, but they wither'd all when my
father
    died. They say he made 
a good end.

    [Sings] For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.

  Laer. Thought and affliction, p
assion, hell itself,
    She turns to favour and to prettiness.
  Oph. (sings)
         And will 
he not come again?
         And will he not come again?
           No, no, he is dead;
          
 Go to thy deathbed;
         He never will come again.

         His beard was as white as snow,

         All flaxen was his poll.
           He is gone, he is gone,
           And we cast away
 moan.
         God 'a'mercy on his soul!

    And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God b' wi'
 you.
Exit.
  Laer. Do you see this, O God?
  King. Laertes, I must commune with your grief,
   
 Or you deny me right. Go but apart,
    Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will,
    And
 they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me.
    If by direct or by collateral hand
    They find
 us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,
    Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours,
    To 
you in satisfaction; but if not,
    Be you content to lend your patience to us,
    And we shall 
jointly labour with your soul
    To give it due content.
  Laer. Let this be so.
    His means o
f death, his obscure funeral-
    No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,
    No noble rit
e nor formal ostentation,-
    Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
    That I must ca
ll't in question.
  King. So you shall;
    And where th' offence is let the great axe fall.
    
I pray you go with me.
                                                          Exeunt

Scene VI.
Elsinore. Another room in the Castle.

Enter Horatio with an Attendant.

  
Hor. What are they that would speak with me?
  Servant. Seafaring men, sir. They say they have lett
ers for
you.
  Hor. Let them come in.
                                               [Exit Attend
ant.]
    I do not know from what part of the world
    I should be greeted, if not from Lord Haml
et.

                          Enter Sailors.

  Sailor. God bless you, sir.
  Hor. Let him ble
ss thee too.
  Sailor. 'A shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter for
you,
    sir,- it com
es from th' ambassador that was bound for
England- if
    your name be Horatio, as I am let to kno
w it is.
  Hor. (reads the letter) 'Horatio, when thou shalt have
overlook'd
    this, give these
 fellows some means to the King. They have
    letters for him. Ere we were two days old at sea, a 
pirate of

    very warlike appointment gave us chase. Finding ourselves too
    slow of sail, we
 put on a compelled valour, and in the
grapple I
    boarded them. On the instant they got clear o
f our ship; so I
    alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with me like
thieves
    of mer
cy; but they knew what they did: I am to do a good turn
for
    them. Let the King have the letter
s I have sent, and repair
thou
    to me with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death. I have
wor
ds
    to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb; yet are they much
too
    light for the bore of
 the matter. These good fellows will
bring
    thee where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold 
their
course
    for England. Of them I have much to tell thee. Farewell.
                       
     'He that thou knowest thine, HAMLET.'

    Come, I will give you way for these your letters,

    And do't the speedier that you may direct me
    To him from whom you brought them.           
        Exeunt.

Scene VII.
Elsinore. Another room in the Castle.

Enter King
 and Laertes.

  King. Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
    And You must put me in y
our heart for friend,
    Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
    That he which hath your
 noble father slain
    Pursued my life.
  Laer. It well appears. But tell me
    Why you proceed
ed not against these feats
    So crimeful and so capital in nature,
    As by your safety, wisdom
, all things else,
    You mainly were stirr'd up.
  King. O, for two special reasons,
    Which 
may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,
    But yet to me they are strong. The Queen his mother

    Lives almost by his looks; and for myself,-
    My virtue or my plague, be it either which,-
 
   She's so conjunctive to my life and soul
    That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
   
 I could not but by her. The other motive
    Why to a public count I might not go
    Is the grea
t love the general gender bear him,
    Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
    Would,
 like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
    Convert his gives to graces; so that my arrows,
 
   Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,
    Would have reverted to my bow again,
    And not 
where I had aim'd them.
  Laer. And so have I a noble father lost;
    A sister driven into desp'r
ate terms,
    Whose worth, if praises may go back again,
    Stood challenger on mount of all the
 age
    For her perfections. But my revenge will come.
  King. Break not your sleeps for that. Yo
u must not think
    That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
    That we can let our beard be s
hook with danger,
    And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more.
    I lov'd your father, 
and we love ourself,
    And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine-

                 Enter a M
essenger with letters.

    How now? What news?
  Mess. Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:
    This 
to your Majesty; this to the Queen.
  King. From Hamlet? Who brought them?
  Mess. Sailors, my lor
d, they say; I saw them not.
    They were given me by Claudio; he receiv'd them
    Of him that b
rought them.
  King. Laertes, you shall hear them.
    Leave us.
                                
                 Exit Messenger.
    [Reads]'High and Mighty,-You shall know I am set naked on
you
r
    kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes;
    when I shall (first asking
 your pardon thereunto) recount the
    occasion of my sudden and more strange return.
           
                                          'HAMLET.'
    What should this mean? Are all the rest com
e back?
    Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?
  Laer. Know you the hand?
  King. 'Tis Hamle
t's character. 'Naked!'
    And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'
    Can you advise me?
  L
aer. I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come!
    It warms the very sickness in my heart
    Th
at I shall live and tell him to his teeth,
    'Thus didest thou.'
  King. If it be so, Laertes
 
   (As how should it be so? how otherwise?),
    Will you be rul'd by me?
  Laer. Ay my lord,
   
 So you will not o'errule me to a peace.
  King. To thine own peace. If he be now return'd
    As 
checking at his voyage, and that he means
    No more to undertake it, I will work him
    To expl
oit now ripe in my device,
    Under the which he shall not choose but fall;
    And for his death
 no wind shall breathe
    But even his mother shall uncharge the practice
    And call it acciden
t.
  Laer. My lord, I will be rul'd;
    The rather, if you could devise it so
    That I might b
e the organ.
  King. It falls right.
    You have been talk'd of since your travel much,
    And 
that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality
    Wherein they say you shine, Your sum of parts
    Did 
not together pluck such envy from him
    As did that one; and that, in my regard,
    Of the unwo
rthiest siege.
  Laer. What part is that, my lord?
  King. A very riband in the cap of youth-
   
 Yet needfull too; for youth no less becomes
    The light and careless livery that it wears
    T
han settled age his sables and his weeds,
    Importing health and graveness. Two months since
   
 Here was a gentleman of Normandy.
    I have seen myself, and serv'd against, the French,
    And
 they can well on horseback; but this gallant
    Had witchcraft in't. He grew unto his seat,
    
And to such wondrous doing brought his horse
    As had he been incorps'd and demi-natur'd
    Wit
h the brave beast. So far he topp'd my thought
    That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
    Co
me short of what he did.
  Laer. A Norman was't?
  King. A Norman.
  Laer. Upon my life, Lamound.

  King. The very same.
  Laer. I know him well. He is the broach indeed
    And gem of all the n
ation.
  King. He made confession of you;
    And gave you such a masterly report
    For art and
 exercise in your defence,
    And for your rapier most especially,
    That he cried out 'twould 
be a sight indeed
    If one could match you. The scrimers of their nation
    He swore had neithe
r motion, guard, nor eye,
    If you oppos'd them. Sir, this report of his
    Did Hamlet so enven
om with his envy
    That he could nothing do but wish and beg
    Your sudden coming o'er to play
 with you.
    Now, out of this-
  Laer. What out of this, my lord?
  King. Laertes, was your fat
her dear to you?
    Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
    A face without a heart,'
  Lae
r. Why ask you this?
  King. Not that I think you did not love your father;
    But that I know lo
ve is begun by time,
    And that I see, in passages of proof,
    Time qualifies the spark and fi
re of it.
    There lives within the very flame of love
    A kind of wick or snuff that will abat
e it;
    And nothing is at a like goodness still;
    For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
    Di
es in his own too-much. That we would do,
    We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes,

    And hath abatements and delays as many
    As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
 
   And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
    That hurts by easing. But to the quick o'
 th' ulcer!
    Hamlet comes back. What would you undertake
    To show yourself your father's son
 in deed
    More than in words?
  Laer. To cut his throat i' th' church!
  King. No place indeed
 should murther sanctuarize;
    Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,
    Will you do
 this? Keep close within your chamber.
    Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home.
    We'll
 put on those shall praise your excellence
    And set a double varnish on the fame
    The French
man gave you; bring you in fine together
    And wager on your heads. He, being remiss,
    Most g
enerous, and free from all contriving,
    Will not peruse the foils; so that with ease,
    Or wi
th a little shuffling, you may choose
    A sword unbated, and, in a pass of practice,
    Requite
 him for your father.
  Laer. I will do't!
    And for that purpose I'll anoint my sword.
    I b
ought an unction of a mountebank,
    So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
    Where it draws bl
ood no cataplasm so rare,
    Collected from all simples that have virtue
    Under the moon, can 
save the thing from death
    This is but scratch'd withal. I'll touch my point
    With this cont
agion, that, if I gall him slightly,
    It may be death.
  King. Let's further think of this,
  
  Weigh what convenience both of time and means
    May fit us to our shape. If this should fall,

    And that our drift look through our bad performance.
    'Twere better not assay'd. Therefore t
his project
    Should have a back or second, that might hold
    If this did blast in proof. Soft
! let me see.
    We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings-
    I ha't!
    When in your motion
 you are hot and dry-
    As make your bouts more violent to that end-
    And that he calls for d
rink, I'll have prepar'd him
    A chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,
    If he by chance
 escape your venom'd stuck,
    Our purpose may hold there.- But stay, what noise,

             
              Enter Queen.

    How now, sweet queen?
  Queen. One woe doth tread upon another's 
heel,
    So fast they follow. Your sister's drown'd, Laertes.
  Laer. Drown'd! O, where?
  Queen
. There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
    That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream.
   
 There with fantastic garlands did she come
    Of crowflowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,

    That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
    But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call
 them.
    There on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds
    Clamb'ring to hang, an envious sliver
 broke,
    When down her weedy trophies and herself
    Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes sp
read wide
    And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up;
    Which time she chaunted snatches of 
old tunes,
    As one incapable of her own distress,
    Or like a creature native and indued
   
 Unto that element; but long it could not be
    Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
 
   Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay
    To muddy death.
  Laer. Alas, then she is dro
wn'd?
  Queen. Drown'd, drown'd.
  Laer. Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
    And there
fore I forbid my tears; but yet
    It is our trick; nature her custom holds,
    Let shame say wh
at it will. When these are gone,
    The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord.
    I have a speech of
 fire, that fain would blaze
    But that this folly douts it.                          Exit.
  Ki
ng. Let's follow, Gertrude.
    How much I had to do to calm his rage I
    Now fear I this will g
ive it start again;
    Therefore let's follow.
                                                  
       Exeunt.

ACT V. Scene I.
Elsinore. A churchyard.

Enter two Clowns, [w
ith spades and pickaxes].

  Clown. Is she to be buried in Christian burial when she
wilfully
  
  seeks her own salvation?
  Other. I tell thee she is; therefore make her grave straight.
    The
 crowner hath sate on her, and finds it Christian burial.
  Clown. How can that be, unless she drow
n'd herself in her own
    defence?
  Other. Why, 'tis found so.
  Clown. It must be se offendend
o; it cannot be else. For here
lies
    the point: if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act; 
and
an
    act hath three branches-it is to act, to do, and to perform;
    argal, she drown'd he
rself wittingly.
  Other. Nay, but hear you, Goodman Delver!
  Clown. Give me leave. Here lies the
 water; good. Here stands
the
    man; good. If the man go to this water and drown himself, it
is
,
    will he nill he, he goes- mark you that. But if the water
come to
    him and drown him, he
 drowns not himself. Argal, he that is
not
    guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.

  Other. But is this law?
  Clown. Ay, marry, is't- crowner's quest law.
  Other. Will you ha' th
e truth an't? If this had not been a
    gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o' Christian

burial.
  Clown. Why, there thou say'st! And the more pity that great
folk
    should have count
'nance in this world to drown or hang
themselves
    more than their even-Christian. Come, my spad
e! There is no
    ancient gentlemen but gard'ners, ditchers, and grave-makers.
They
    hold up 
Adam's profession.
  Other. Was he a gentleman?
  Clown. 'A was the first that ever bore arms.
  
Other. Why, he had none.
  Clown. What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the
Scripture?
  
  The Scripture says Adam digg'd. Could he dig without arms?
I'll
    put another question to thee
. If thou answerest me not to the
    purpose, confess thyself-
  Other. Go to!
  Clown. What is 
he that builds stronger than either the mason,
the
    shipwright, or the carpenter?
  Other. The
 gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand
    tenants.
  Clown. I like thy wit well, in g
ood faith. The gallows does
well.
    But how does it well? It does well to those that do ill. Now
,
    thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the
    church. Argal, the gallows m
ay do well to thee. To't again,
come!
  Other. Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or 
a
    carpenter?
  Clown. Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
  Other. Marry, now I can tell!
  Clown.
 To't.
  Other. Mass, I cannot tell.

                 Enter Hamlet and Horatio afar off.

  Cl
own. Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull ass
will
    not mend his pace with beating
; and when you are ask'd this
    question next, say 'a grave-maker.' The houses he makes lasts
  
  till doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan; fetch me a stoup of
    liquor.
                        
                    [Exit Second Clown.]


                       [Clown digs and] sings.

    
   In youth when I did love, did love,
         Methought it was very sweet;
       To contract- O
- the time for- a- my behove,
         O, methought there- a- was nothing- a- meet.

  Ham. Has t
his fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings
at
    grave-making?
  Hor. Custom hath made
 it in him a property of easiness.
  Ham. 'Tis e'en so. The hand of little employment hath the
dai
ntier
    sense.
  Clown. (sings)
         But age with his stealing steps
           Hath clawe
d me in his clutch,
         And hath shipped me intil the land,
           As if I had never been
 such.
                                            [Throws up a skull.]

  Ham. That skull had a 
tongue in it, and could sing once. How
the
    knave jowls it to the ground,as if 'twere Cain's ja
wbone,
that
    did the first murther! This might be the pate of a
Politician,
    which this as
s now o'erreaches; one that would circumvent
God,
    might it not?
  Hor. It might, my lord.
  
Ham. Or of a courtier, which could say 'Good morrow, sweet
lord!
    How dost thou, good lord?' Th
is might be my Lord Such-a-one,
that
    prais'd my Lord Such-a-one's horse when he meant to beg i
t-
might
    it not?
  Hor. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Why, e'en so! and now my Lady Worm's, chapless, 
and
knock'd
    about the mazzard with a sexton's spade. Here's fine
revolution,
    and we had 
the trick to see't. Did these bones cost no more
the
    breeding but to play at loggets with 'em?
 Mine ache to think
    on't.
  Clown. (Sings)
         A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,
        
   For and a shrouding sheet;
         O, a Pit of clay for to be made
           For such a guest
 is meet.
                                      Throws up [another skull].

  Ham. There's anothe
r. Why may not that be the skull of a
lawyer?
    Where be his quiddits now, his quillets, his cas
es, his
tenures,
    and his tricks? Why does he suffer this rude knave now to
knock
    him abo
ut the sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell
him
    of his action of battery? Hum! This f
ellow might be in's time
a
    great buyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizances,
his
  
  fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries. Is this the fine
of
    his fines, and the recovery 
of his recoveries, to have his
fine
    pate full of fine dirt? Will his vouchers vouch him no mor
e
of
    his purchases, and double ones too, than the length and
breadth
    of a pair of indent
ures? The very conveyances of his lands
will
    scarcely lie in this box; and must th' inheritor 
himself have
no
    more, ha?
  Hor. Not a jot more, my lord.
  Ham. Is not parchment made of sh
eepskins?
  Hor. Ay, my lord, And of calveskins too.
  Ham. They are sheep and calves which seek o
ut assurance in
that. I
    will speak to this fellow. Whose grave's this, sirrah?
  Clown. Mine,
 sir.

    [Sings] O, a pit of clay for to be made
              For such a guest is meet.

  H
am. I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in't.
  Clown. You lie out on't, sir, and therefore 
'tis not yours.
    For my part, I do not lie in't, yet it is mine.
  Ham. Thou dost lie in't, to 
be in't and say it is thine. 'Tis
for
    the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.
  Cl
own. 'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away again from me to you.
  Ham. What man dost thou dig it for?

  Clown. For no man, sir.
  Ham. What woman then?
  Clown. For none neither.
  Ham. Who is to b
e buried in't?
  Clown. One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's
dead.
  Ham. How abs
olute the knave is! We must speak by the card, or
    equivocation will undo us. By the Lord, Horat
io, this three
years
    I have taken note of it, the age is grown so picked that the
toe
    of
 the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he
galls
    his kibe.- How long hast thou bee
n a grave-maker?
  Clown. Of all the days i' th' year, I came to't that day that
our
    last kin
g Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.
  Ham. How long is that since?
  Clown. Cannot you tell that? Every 
fool can tell that. It was
the
    very day that young Hamlet was born- he that is mad, and sent

    into England.
  Ham. Ay, marry, why was be sent into England?
  Clown. Why, because 'a was mad
. 'A shall recover his wits
there;
    or, if 'a do not, 'tis no great matter there.
  Ham. Why?

  Clown. 'Twill not he seen in him there. There the men are as
mad as
    he.
  Ham. How came he
 mad?
  Clown. Very strangely, they say.
  Ham. How strangely?
  Clown. Faith, e'en with losing h
is wits.
  Ham. Upon what ground?
  Clown. Why, here in Denmark. I have been sexton here, man and

boy
    thirty years.
  Ham. How long will a man lie i' th' earth ere he rot?
  Clown. Faith, if
 'a be not rotten before 'a die (as we have
many
    pocky corses now-a-days that will scarce hold
 the laying in,
I
    will last you some eight year or nine year. A tanner will
last
    you nin
e year.
  Ham. Why he more than another?
  Clown. Why, sir, his hide is so tann'd with his trade t
hat 'a
will
    keep out water a great while; and your water is a sore
decayer of
    your whore
son dead body. Here's a skull now. This skull hath
lien
    you i' th' earth three-and-twenty year
s.
  Ham. Whose was it?
  Clown. A whoreson, mad fellow's it was. Whose do you think it
was?
  H
am. Nay, I know not.
  Clown. A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! 'A pour'd a flagon
of
    Rhen
ish on my head once. This same skull, sir, was Yorick's
    skull, the King's jester.
  Ham. This?

  Clown. E'en that.
  Ham. Let me see. [Takes the skull.] Alas, poor Yorick! I knew
him,
    Ho
ratio. A fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy.
He
    hath borne me on his back a thou
sand times. And now how
abhorred
    in my imagination it is! My gorge rises at it. Here hung
tho
se
    lips that I have kiss'd I know not how oft. Where be your
gibes
    now? your gambols? you
r songs? your flashes of merriment that
    were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to m
ock
your
    own grinning? Quite chap- fall'n? Now get you to my lady's
    chamber, and tell her
, let her paint an inch thick, to this
    favour she must come. Make her laugh at that. Prithee,

Horatio,
    tell me one thing.
  Hor. What's that, my lord?
  Ham. Dost thou think Alexander loo
k'd o' this fashion i' th'
earth?
  Hor. E'en so.
  Ham. And smelt so? Pah!
                    
                      [Puts down the skull.]
  Hor. E'en so, my lord.
  Ham. To what base uses we 
may return, Horatio! Why may not
    imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it

    stopping a bunghole?
  Hor. 'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.
  Ham. No, fait
h, not a jot; but to follow him thither with
modesty
    enough, and likelihood to lead it; as thu
s: Alexander died,
    Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust
is
    earth
; of earth we make loam; and why of that loam (whereto
he
    was converted) might they not stop a
 beer barrel?
    Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
    Might stop a hole to keep the win
d away.
    O, that that earth which kept the world in awe
    Should patch a wall t' expel the wi
nter's flaw!
    But soft! but soft! aside! Here comes the King-

    Enter [priests with] a coff
in [in funeral procession], King,
             Queen, Laertes, with Lords attendant.]

    The Qu
een, the courtiers. Who is this they follow?
    And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken
   
 The corse they follow did with desp'rate hand
    Fordo it own life. 'Twas of some estate.
    Co
uch we awhile, and mark.
                                         [Retires with Horatio.]

  Laer
. What ceremony else?
  Ham. That is Laertes,
    A very noble youth. Mark.
  Laer. What ceremony
 else?
  Priest. Her obsequies have been as far enlarg'd
    As we have warranty. Her death was do
ubtful;
    And, but that great command o'ersways the order,
    She should in ground unsanctified
 have lodg'd
    Till the last trumpet. For charitable prayers,
    Shards, flints, and pebbles sh
ould be thrown on her.
    Yet here she is allow'd her virgin rites,
    Her maiden strewments, an
d the bringing home
    Of bell and burial.
  Laer. Must there no more be done?
  Priest. No more
 be done.
    We should profane the service of the dead
    To sing a requiem and such rest to her

    As to peace-parted souls.
  Laer. Lay her i' th' earth;
    And from her fair and unpolluted
 flesh
    May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,
    A minist'ring angel shall my sist
er be
    When thou liest howling.
  Ham. What, the fair Ophelia?
  Queen. Sweets to the sweet! F
arewell.
                                             [Scatters flowers.]
    I hop'd thou shoulds
t have been my Hamlet's wife;
    I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
    And not 
have strew'd thy grave.
  Laer. O, treble woe
    Fall ten times treble on that cursed head
    W
hose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
    Depriv'd thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,
    Til
l I have caught her once more in mine arms.
                                             Leaps in t
he grave.
    Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead
    Till of this flat a mountain you have
 made
    T' o'ertop old Pelion or the skyish head
    Of blue Olympus.
  Ham. [comes forward] Wh
at is he whose grief
    Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow
    Conjures the wand'ring
 stars, and makes them stand
    Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,
    Hamlet the Dane.     
               [Leaps in after Laertes.
  Laer. The devil take thy soul!
                         
                   [Grapples with him].
  Ham. Thou pray'st not well.
    I prithee take thy finge
rs from my throat;
    For, though I am not splenitive and rash,
    Yet have I in me something da
ngerous,
    Which let thy wisdom fear. Hold off thy hand!
  King. Pluck them asunder.
  Queen. H
amlet, Hamlet!
  All. Gentlemen!
  Hor. Good my lord, be quiet.
             [The Attendants part
 them, and they come out of the
                                                         grave.]
 
 Ham. Why, I will fight with him upon this theme
    Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
  Queen.
 O my son, what theme?
  Ham. I lov'd Ophelia. Forty thousand brothers
    Could not (with all the
ir quantity of love)
    Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?
  King. O, he is mad, Laertes.

  Queen. For love of God, forbear him!
  Ham. 'Swounds, show me what thou't do.
    Woo't weep? 
woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?
    Woo't drink up esill? eat a crocodile?
    I'll d
o't. Dost thou come here to whine?
    To outface me with leaping in her grave?
    Be buried quic
k with her, and so will I.
    And if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
    Millions of acre
s on us, till our ground,
    Singeing his pate against the burning zone,
    Make Ossa like a war
t! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
    I'll rant as well as thou.
  Queen. This is mere madness;
    And t
hus a while the fit will work on him.
    Anon, as patient as the female dove
    When that her go
lden couplets are disclos'd,
    His silence will sit drooping.
  Ham. Hear you, sir!
    What is
 the reason that you use me thus?
    I lov'd you ever. But it is no matter.
    Let Hercules hims
elf do what he may,
    The cat will mew, and dog will have his day.
Exit.
  King. I pray thee, g
ood Horatio, wait upon him.
                                                   Exit Horatio.
    [
To Laertes] Strengthen your patience in our last night's
speech.
    We'll put the matter to the p
resent push.-
    Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.-
    This grave shall have a living
 monument.
    An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
    Till then in patience our proceeding be.

                                                         Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A h
all in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet and Horatio.

  Ham. So much for this, sir; now shall you see t
he other.
    You do remember all the circumstance?
  Hor. Remember it, my lord!
  Ham. Sir, in m
y heart there was a kind of fighting
    That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay
    Worse th
an the mutinies in the bilboes. Rashly-
    And prais'd be rashness for it; let us know,
    Our i
ndiscretion sometime serves us well
    When our deep plots do pall; and that should learn us
    
There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
    Rough-hew them how we will-
  Hor. That is most certa
in.
  Ham. Up from my cabin,
    My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
    Grop'd I to find o
ut them; had my desire,
    Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew
    To mine own room again
; making so bold
    (My fears forgetting manners) to unseal
    Their grand commission; where I f
ound, Horatio
    (O royal knavery!), an exact command,
    Larded with many several sorts of reas
ons,
    Importing Denmark's health, and England's too,
    With, hoo! such bugs and goblins in my
 life-
    That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
    No, not to stay the finding of the axe,

    My head should be struck off.
  Hor. Is't possible?
  Ham. Here's the commission; read it at m
ore leisure.
    But wilt thou bear me how I did proceed?
  Hor. I beseech you.
  Ham. Being thus
 benetted round with villanies,
    Or I could make a prologue to my brains,
    They had begun th
e play. I sat me down;
    Devis'd a new commission; wrote it fair.
    I once did hold it, as our
 statists do,
    A baseness to write fair, and labour'd much
    How to forget that learning; but
, sir, now
    It did me yeoman's service. Wilt thou know
    Th' effect of what I wrote?
  Hor. 
Ay, good my lord.
  Ham. An earnest conjuration from the King,
    As England was his faithful tri
butary,
    As love between them like the palm might flourish,
    As peace should still her wheat
en garland wear
    And stand a comma 'tween their amities,
    And many such-like as's of great c
harge,
    That, on the view and knowing of these contents,
    Without debatement further, more o
r less,
    He should the bearers put to sudden death,
    Not shriving time allow'd.
  Hor. How 
was this seal'd?
  Ham. Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
    I had my father's signet in my 
purse,
    Which was the model of that Danish seal;
    Folded the writ up in the form of th' othe
r,
    Subscrib'd it, gave't th' impression, plac'd it safely,
    The changeling never known. Now
, the next day
    Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent
    Thou know'st already.
  Ho
r. So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.
  Ham. Why, man, they did make love to this employment!

    They are not near my conscience; their defeat
    Does by their own insinuation grow.
    'T
is dangerous when the baser nature comes
    Between the pass and fell incensed points
    Of migh
ty opposites.
  Hor. Why, what a king is this!
  Ham. Does it not, thinks't thee, stand me now upo
n-
    He that hath kill'd my king, and whor'd my mother;
    Popp'd in between th' election and m
y hopes;
    Thrown out his angle for my proper life,
    And with such coz'nage- is't not perfect
 conscience
    To quit him with this arm? And is't not to be damn'd
    To let this canker of our
 nature come
    In further evil?
  Hor. It must be shortly known to him from England
    What is
 the issue of the business there.
  Ham. It will be short; the interim is mine,
    And a man's li
fe is no more than to say 'one.'
    But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
    That to Laertes I forg
ot myself,
    For by the image of my cause I see
    The portraiture of his. I'll court his favou
rs.
    But sure the bravery of his grief did put me
    Into a tow'ring passion.
  Hor. Peace! W
ho comes here?

                 Enter young Osric, a courtier.

  Osr. Your lordship is right w
elcome back to Denmark.
  Ham. I humbly thank you, sir. [Aside to Horatio] Dost know this
    wate
rfly?
  Hor. [aside to Hamlet] No, my good lord.
  Ham. [aside to Horatio] Thy state is the more g
racious; for
'tis a
    vice to know him. He hath much land, and fertile. Let a beast
be
    lor
d of beasts, and his crib shall stand at the king's mess.
'Tis
    a chough; but, as I say, spacio
us in the possession of dirt.

  Osr. Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should
impa
rt
    a thing to you from his Majesty.
  Ham. I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of spiri
t. Put
your
    bonnet to his right use. 'Tis for the head.
  Osr. I thank your lordship, it is v
ery hot.
  Ham. No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly.
  Osr. It is indifferent co
ld, my lord, indeed.
  Ham. But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my
complexion.
  Osr. 
Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry, as 'twere- I
cannot
    tell how. But, my lord, his Majes
ty bade me signify to you
that
    he has laid a great wager on your head. Sir, this is the
matte
r-
  Ham. I beseech you remember.
                           [Hamlet moves him to put on his hat.]

  Osr. Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here
is
    newly come to court Lae
rtes; believe me, an absolute
gentleman,
    full of most excellent differences, of very soft soci
ety and
    great showing. Indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the
card
    or calendar of g
entry; for you shall find in him the
continent of
    what part a gentleman would see.
  Ham. Sir
, his definement suffers no perdition in you; though, I

    know, to divide him inventorially wou
ld dozy th' arithmetic
of
    memory, and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail.
    B
ut, in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of
great
    article, and his infusion of 
such dearth and rareness as, to
make
    true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror, and who

else
    would trace him, his umbrage, nothing more.
  Osr. Your lordship speaks most infallibly
 of him.
  Ham. The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our
more
    rawer breath?

  Osr. Sir?
  Hor [aside to Hamlet] Is't not possible to understand in
another
    tongue? You w
ill do't, sir, really.
  Ham. What imports the nomination of this gentleman?
  Osr. Of Laertes?
 
 Hor. [aside] His purse is empty already. All's golden words are
    spent.
  Ham. Of him, sir.
 
 Osr. I know you are not ignorant-
  Ham. I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would

not
    much approve me. Well, sir?
  Osr. You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is-

  Ham. I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in
    excellence; but to know a man
 well were to know himself.
  Osr. I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on
him

    by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.
  Ham. What's his weapon?
  Osr. Rapier and dagger.
  
Ham. That's two of his weapons- but well.
  Osr. The King, sir, hath wager'd with him six Barbary h
orses;
    against the which he has impon'd, as I take it, six French
    rapiers and poniards, wi
th their assigns, as girdle, hangers,
and
    so. Three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear 
to fancy,
    very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of
    very liberal conce
it.
  Ham. What call you the carriages?
  Hor. [aside to Hamlet] I knew you must be edified by the

margent
    ere you had done.
  Osr. The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
  Ham. The phrase wou
ld be more germane to the matter if we could
    carry cannon by our sides. I would it might be han
gers till
then.
    But on! Six Barbary horses against six French swords, their
    assigns, and 
three liberal-conceited carriages: that's the
French
    bet against the Danish. Why is this all i
mpon'd, as you call
it?
  Osr. The King, sir, hath laid that, in a dozen passes between
    yours
elf and him, he shall not exceed you three hits; he hath
    laid on twelve for nine, and it would 
come to immediate trial
    if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.
  Ham. How if I answer no
?
  Osr. I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
  Ham. Sir, I will walk here in 
the hall. If it please his
Majesty,
    it is the breathing time of day with me. Let the foils be

    brought, the gentleman willing, and the King hold his
purpose,
    I will win for him if I ca
n; if not, I will gain nothing but
my
    shame and the odd hits.
  Osr. Shall I redeliver you e'
en so?
  Ham. To this effect, sir, after what flourish your nature will.
  Osr. I commend my duty 
to your lordship.
  Ham. Yours, yours. [Exit Osric.] He does well to commend it
    himself; there
 are no tongues else for's turn.
  Hor. This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.
  Ham. 
He did comply with his dug before he suck'd it. Thus has
he,
    and many more of the same bevy th
at I know the drossy age
dotes
    on, only got the tune of the time and outward habit of
encount
er-
    a kind of yesty collection, which carries them through and
    through the most fann'd and
 winnowed opinions; and do but
blow
    them to their trial-the bubbles are out,

              
              Enter a Lord.

  Lord. My lord, his Majesty commended him to you by young Osric,
wh
o
    brings back to him, that you attend him in the hall. He sends
to
    know if your pleasure 
hold to play with Laertes, or that you
will
    take longer time.
  Ham. I am constant to my purp
oses; they follow the King's
pleasure.
    If his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or whensoever
,
provided
    I be so able as now.
  Lord. The King and Queen and all are coming down.
  Ham. I
n happy time.
  Lord. The Queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to
    Laertes before
 you fall to play.
  Ham. She well instructs me.
                                                 
   [Exit Lord.]
  Hor. You will lose this wager, my lord.
  Ham. I do not think so. Since he went 
into France I have been
in
    continual practice. I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst
not

    think how ill all's here about my heart. But it is no matter.
  Hor. Nay, good my lord -
  Ha
m. It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gaingiving as
    would perhaps trouble a woman.
  
Hor. If your mind dislike anything, obey it. I will forestall
their
    repair hither and say you 
are not fit.
  Ham. Not a whit, we defy augury; there's a special providence
in
    the fall of a
 sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not to come; if it
be
    not to come, it will be now; if it be not n
ow, yet it will
come:
    the readiness is all. Since no man knows aught of what he
leaves,
    
what is't to leave betimes? Let be.

    Enter King, Queen, Laertes, Osric, and Lords, with other

              Attendants with foils and gauntlets.
               A table and flagons of wine on i
t.

  King. Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
                    [The King puts La
ertes' hand into Hamlet's.]
  Ham. Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong;
    But pardon
't, as you are a gentleman.
    This presence knows,
    And you must needs have heard, how I am p
unish'd
    With sore distraction. What I have done
    That might your nature, honour, and except
ion
    Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
    Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet
.
    If Hamlet from himself be taken away,
    And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
   
 Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
    Who does it, then? His madness. If't be so,
    Ha
mlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
    His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
    Sir, in this a
udience,
    Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd evil
    Free me so far in your most generous thou
ghts
    That I have shot my arrow o'er the house
    And hurt my brother.
  Laer. I am satisfied
 in nature,
    Whose motive in this case should stir me most
    To my revenge. But in my terms o
f honour
    I stand aloof, and will no reconcilement
    Till by some elder masters of known hono
ur
    I have a voice and precedent of peace
    To keep my name ungor'd. But till that time
    
I do receive your offer'd love like love,
    And will not wrong it.
  Ham. I embrace it freely,

    And will this brother's wager frankly play.
    Give us the foils. Come on.
  Laer. Come, one 
for me.
  Ham. I'll be your foil, Laertes. In mine ignorance
    Your skill shall, like a star i' 
th' darkest night,
    Stick fiery off indeed.
  Laer. You mock me, sir.
  Ham. No, by this hand.

  King. Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
    You know the wager?
  Ham. Very wel
l, my lord.
    Your Grace has laid the odds o' th' weaker side.
  King. I do not fear it, I have 
seen you both;
    But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.
  Laer. This is too heavy; le
t me see another.
  Ham. This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
                      
                          Prepare to play.
  Osr. Ay, my good lord.
  King. Set me the stoups of w
ine upon that table.
    If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
    Or quit in answer of the thir
d exchange,
    Let all the battlements their ordnance fire;
    The King shall drink to Hamlet's 
better breath,
    And in the cup an union shall he throw
    Richer than that which four successi
ve kings
    In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;
    And let the kettle to the trumpet
 speak,
    The trumpet to the cannoneer without,
    The cannons to the heavens, the heaven to ea
rth,
    'Now the King drinks to Hamlet.' Come, begin.
    And you the judges, bear a wary eye.
 
 Ham. Come on, sir.
  Laer. Come, my lord.                                They play.
  Ham. One.

  Laer. No.
  Ham. Judgment!
  Osr. A hit, a very palpable hit.
  Laer. Well, again!
  King. Sta
y, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
    Here's to thy health.
               [Drum; tru
mpets sound; a piece goes off [within].
    Give him the cup.
  Ham. I'll play this bout first; se
t it by awhile.
    Come. (They play.) Another hit. What say you?
  Laer. A touch, a touch; I do c
onfess't.
  King. Our son shall win.
  Queen. He's fat, and scant of breath.
    Here, Hamlet, ta
ke my napkin, rub thy brows.
    The Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
  Ham. Good madam!
  
King. Gertrude, do not drink.
  Queen. I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.          Drinks.
  K
ing. [aside] It is the poison'd cup; it is too late.
  Ham. I dare not drink yet, madam; by-and-by.

  Queen. Come, let me wipe thy face.
  Laer. My lord, I'll hit him now.
  King. I do not think't
.
  Laer. [aside] And yet it is almost against my conscience.
  Ham. Come for the third, Laertes! 
You but dally.
    Pray you pass with your best violence;
    I am afeard you make a wanton of me.

  Laer. Say you so? Come on.                               Play.
  Osr. Nothing neither way.
  L
aer. Have at you now!
                [Laertes wounds Hamlet; then] in scuffling, they
           
         change rapiers, [and Hamlet wounds Laertes].
  King. Part them! They are incens'd.
  Ham.
 Nay come! again!                         The Queen falls.

  Osr. Look to the Queen there, ho!
 
 Hor. They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?
  Osr. How is't, Laertes?
  Laer. Why, as a wo
odcock to mine own springe, Osric.
    I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.
  Ham. How does
 the Queen?
  King. She sounds to see them bleed.
  Queen. No, no! the drink, the drink! O my dear
 Hamlet!
    The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.                 [Dies.]
  Ham. O villany! Ho! le
t the door be lock'd.
    Treachery! Seek it out.
                                                
[Laertes falls.]
  Laer. It is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain;
    No medicine in the world 
can do thee good.
    In thee there is not half an hour of life.
    The treacherous instrument is
 in thy hand,
    Unbated and envenom'd. The foul practice
    Hath turn'd itself on me. Lo, here 
I lie,
    Never to rise again. Thy mother's poison'd.
    I can no more. The King, the King's to 
blame.
  Ham. The point envenom'd too?
    Then, venom, to thy work.                    Hurts the 
King.
  All. Treason! treason!
  King. O, yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt.
  Ham. Here, tho
u incestuous, murd'rous, damned Dane,
    Drink off this potion! Is thy union here?
    Follow my 
mother.                                 King dies.
  Laer. He is justly serv'd.
    It is a poison
 temper'd by himself.
    Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet.
    Mine and my father's dea
th come not upon thee,
    Nor thine on me!                                       Dies.
  Ham. Hea
ven make thee free of it! I follow thee.
    I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!
    You th
at look pale and tremble at this chance,
    That are but mutes or audience to this act,
    Had I
 but time (as this fell sergeant, Death,
    Is strict in his arrest) O, I could tell you-
    But
 let it be. Horatio, I am dead;
    Thou liv'st; report me and my cause aright
    To the unsatisf
ied.
  Hor. Never believe it.
    I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.
    Here's yet some liq
uor left.
  Ham. As th'art a man,
    Give me the cup. Let go! By heaven, I'll ha't.
    O good H
oratio, what a wounded name
    (Things standing thus unknown) shall live behind me!
    If thou d
idst ever hold me in thy heart,
    Absent thee from felicity awhile,
    And in this harsh world 
draw thy breath in pain,
    To tell my story.         [March afar off, and shot within.]
    What
 warlike noise is this?
  Osr. Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
    To the ambass
adors of England gives
    This warlike volley.
  Ham. O, I die, Horatio!
    The potent poison q
uite o'ercrows my spirit.
    I cannot live to hear the news from England,
    But I do prophesy t
h' election lights
    On Fortinbras. He has my dying voice.
    So tell him, with th' occurrents,
 more and less,
    Which have solicited- the rest is silence.             Dies.
  Hor. Now cracks
 a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince,
    And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
       
                                          [March within.]
    Why does the drum come hither?

   
 Enter Fortinbras and English Ambassadors, with Drum,
                  Colours, and Attendants.


  Fort. Where is this sight?
  Hor. What is it you will see?
    If aught of woe or wonder, cease
 your search.
  Fort. This quarry cries on havoc. O proud Death,
    What feast is toward in thine
 eternal cell
    That thou so many princes at a shot
    So bloodily hast struck.
  Ambassador. 
The sight is dismal;
    And our affairs from England come too late.
    The ears are senseless th
at should give us hearing
    To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd
    That Rosencrantz and Gu
ildenstern are dead.
    Where should we have our thanks?
  Hor. Not from his mouth,
    Had it t
h' ability of life to thank you.
    He never gave commandment for their death.
    But since, so 
jump upon this bloody question,
    You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
    Are here a
rriv'd, give order that these bodies
    High on a stage be placed to the view;
    And let me spe
ak to the yet unknowing world
    How these things came about. So shall you hear
    Of carnal, bl
oody and unnatural acts;
    Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters;
    Of deaths put on by c
unning and forc'd cause;
    And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
    Fall'n on th' inventors' he
ads. All this can I
    Truly deliver.
  Fort. Let us haste to hear it,
    And call the noblest 
to the audience.
    For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.
    I have some rights of memory in
 this kingdom
    Which now, to claim my vantage doth invite me.
  Hor. Of that I shall have also 
cause to speak,
    And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more.
    But let this same be pre
sently perform'd,
    Even while men's minds are wild, lest more mischance
    On plots and errors
 happen.
  Fort. Let four captains
    Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage;
    For he was li
kely, had he been put on,
    To have prov'd most royally; and for his passage
    The soldiers' m
usic and the rites of war
    Speak loudly for him.
    Take up the bodies. Such a sight as this

    Becomes the field but here shows much amiss.
    Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
            Exeun
t marching; after the which a peal of ordnance
                                                   a
re shot off.

ACT I. Scene I.
Elsinore. A p
latform before the Castle.

Enter two Sentinels-[first,] Francisco, [who paces up and down
at his
 post; then] Bernardo, [who approaches him].

  Ber. Who's there?
  Fran. Nay, answer me. Stand a
nd unfold yourself.
  Ber. Long live the King!
  Fran. Bernardo?
  Ber. He.
  Fran. You come mos
t carefully upon your hour.
  Ber. 'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.
  Fran. For
 this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold,
    And I am sick at heart.
  Ber. Have you had quiet 
guard?
  Fran. Not a mouse stirring.
  Ber. Well, good night.
    If you do meet Horatio and Marc
ellus,
    The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.

                    Enter Horatio and Ma
rcellus.

  Fran. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?
  Hor. Friends to this ground.
 
 Mar. And liegemen to the Dane.
  Fran. Give you good night.
  Mar. O, farewell, honest soldier.

    Who hath reliev'd you?
  Fran. Bernardo hath my place.
    Give you good night.               
                    Exit.
  Mar. Holla, Bernardo!
  Ber. Say-
    What, is Horatio there ?
  Hor
. A piece of him.
  Ber. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.
  Mar. What, has this thing ap
pear'd again to-night?
  Ber. I have seen nothing.
  Mar. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
    
And will not let belief take hold of him
    Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.
    Th
erefore I have entreated him along,
    With us to watch the minutes of this night,
    That, if a
gain this apparition come,
    He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
  Hor. Tush, tush, 'twill 
not appear.
  Ber. Sit down awhile,
    And let us once again assail your ears,
    That are so f
ortified against our story,
    What we two nights have seen.
  Hor. Well, sit we down,
    And l
et us hear Bernardo speak of this.
  Ber. Last night of all,
    When yond same star that's westwa
rd from the pole
    Had made his course t' illume that part of heaven
    Where now it burns, Mar
cellus and myself,
    The bell then beating one-

                        Enter Ghost.

  Mar.
 Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!
  Ber. In the same figure, like the King that's 
dead.
  Mar. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
  Ber. Looks it not like the King? Mark it,
 Horatio.
  Hor. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.
  Ber. It would be spoke to.
  Ma
r. Question it, Horatio.
  Hor. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night
    Together with t
hat fair and warlike form
    In which the majesty of buried Denmark
    Did sometimes march? By h
eaven I charge thee speak!
  Mar. It is offended.
  Ber. See, it stalks away!
  Hor. Stay! Speak,
 speak! I charge thee speak!
                                                     Exit Ghost.
  Ma
r. 'Tis gone and will not answer.
  Ber. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale.
    Is not t
his something more than fantasy?
    What think you on't?
  Hor. Before my God, I might not this b
elieve
    Without the sensible and true avouch
    Of mine own eyes.
  Mar. Is it not like the K
ing?
  Hor. As thou art to thyself.
    Such was the very armour he had on
    When he th' ambiti
ous Norway combated.
    So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,
    He smote the sledded Pola
cks on the ice.
    'Tis strange.
  Mar. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
    With 
martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
  Hor. In what particular thought to work I know not;
   
 But, in the gross and scope of my opinion,
    This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
  M
ar. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows,
    Why this same strict and most observant watc
h
    So nightly toils the subject of the land,
    And why such daily cast of brazen cannon
    
And foreign mart for implements of war;
    Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
    D
oes not divide the Sunday from the week.
    What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
    Doth
 make the night joint-labourer with the day?
    Who is't that can inform me?
  Hor. That can I.

    At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
    Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
   
 Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
    Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
    Da
r'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet
    (For so this side of our known world esteem'd hi
m)
    Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,
    Well ratified by law and heraldry,

    Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
    Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror
;
    Against the which a moiety competent
    Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
    To t
he inheritance of Fortinbras,
    Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant
    And carriag
e of the article design'd,
    His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
    Of unimproved m
ettle hot and full,
    Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,
    Shark'd up a list of law
less resolutes,
    For food and diet, to some enterprise
    That hath a stomach in't; which is n
o other,
    As it doth well appear unto our state,
    But to recover of us, by strong hand
    
And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
    So by his father lost; and this, I take it,
    I
s the main motive of our preparations,
    The source of this our watch, and the chief head
    Of
 this post-haste and romage in the land.
  Ber. I think it be no other but e'en so.
    Well may i
t sort that this portentous figure
    Comes armed through our watch, so like the King
    That wa
s and is the question of these wars.
  Hor. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
    In the mos
t high and palmy state of Rome,
    A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
    The graves stood t
enantless, and the sheeted dead
    Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;
    As stars with 
trains of fire, and dews of blood,
    Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
    Upon whose inf
luence Neptune's empire stands
    Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.
    And even the like
 precurse of fierce events,
    As harbingers preceding still the fates
    And prologue to the om
en coming on,
    Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
    Unto our climature and countryme
n.

                      Enter Ghost again.

    But soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again!
 
   I'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!
                                             
  Spreads his arms.
    If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
    Speak to me.
    If there be
 any good thing to be done,
    That may to thee do ease, and, race to me,
    Speak to me.
    I
f thou art privy to thy country's fate,
    Which happily foreknowing may avoid,
    O, speak!
  
  Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
    Extorted treasure in the womb of earth
    (For which,
 they say, you spirits oft walk in death),
                                                 The coc
k crows.
    Speak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!
  Mar. Shall I strike at it with m
y partisan?
  Hor. Do, if it will not stand.
  Ber. 'Tis here!
  Hor. 'Tis here!
  Mar. 'Tis gon
e!
                                                     Exit Ghost.
    We do it wrong, being so m
ajestical,
    To offer it the show of violence;
    For it is as the air, invulnerable,
    And 
our vain blows malicious mockery.
  Ber. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
  Hor. And the
n it started, like a guilty thing
    Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
    The cock, that is t
he trumpet to the morn,
    Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
    Awake the god of da
y; and at his warning,
    Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
    Th' extravagant and erring
 spirit hies
    To his confine; and of the truth herein
    This present object made probation.

  Mar. It faded on the crowing of the cock.
    Some say that ever, 'gainst that season comes
    
Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
    The bird of dawning singeth all night long;
    And
 then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,
    The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,

    No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
    So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
 
 Hor. So have I heard and do in part believe it.
    But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
  
  Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.
    Break we our watch up; and by my advice
    Le
t us impart what we have seen to-night
    Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
    This spirit, 
dumb to us, will speak to him.
    Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
    As needful in
 our loves, fitting our duty?
    Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
    Where we shall f
ind him most conveniently.           Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A room of state in the Ca
stle.

Flourish. [Enter Claudius, King of Denmark, Gertrude the Queen,
Hamlet,
Polonius, Laertes
 and his sister Ophelia, [Voltemand, Cornelius,]
Lords Attendant.

  King. Though yet of Hamlet o
ur dear brother's death
    The memory be green, and that it us befitted
    To bear our hearts in
 grief, and our whole kingdom
    To be contracted in one brow of woe,
    Yet so far hath discret
ion fought with nature
    That we with wisest sorrow think on him
    Together with remembrance o
f ourselves.
    Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
    Th' imperial jointress to this 
warlike state,
    Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,
    With an auspicious, and a dropping 
eye,
    With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,
    In equal scale weighing delight an
d dole,
    Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd
    Your better wisdoms, which have freely go
ne
    With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
    Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbr
as,
    Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
    Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
  
  Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
    Colleagued with this dream of his advantage,
    
He hath not fail'd to pester us with message
    Importing the surrender of those lands
    Lost b
y his father, with all bands of law,
    To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
    Now for
 ourself and for this time of meeting.
    Thus much the business is: we have here writ
    To Nor
way, uncle of young Fortinbras,
    Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears
    Of this his nephe
w's purpose, to suppress
    His further gait herein, in that the levies,
    The lists, and full 
proportions are all made
    Out of his subject; and we here dispatch
    You, good Cornelius, and
 you, Voltemand,
    For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,
    Giving to you no further pers
onal power
    To business with the King, more than the scope
    Of these dilated articles allow.
            [Gives a paper.]
    Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
  Cor., Volt. In 
that, and all things, will we show our duty.
  King. We doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell.
     
                            Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius.
    And now, Laertes, what's the news w
ith you?
    You told us of some suit. What is't, Laertes?
    You cannot speak of reason to the D
ane
    And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
    That shall not be my offer, not t
hy asking?
    The head is not more native to the heart,
    The hand more instrumental to the mou
th,
    Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
    What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
  Laer.
 My dread lord,
    Your leave and favour to return to France;
    From whence though willingly I 
came to Denmark
    To show my duty in your coronation,
    Yet now I must confess, that duty done
,
    My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
    And bow them to your gracious leave and 
pardon.
  King. Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
  Pol. He hath, my lord, wrung f
rom me my slow leave
    By laboursome petition, and at last
    Upon his will I seal'd my hard co
nsent.
    I do beseech you give him leave to go.
  King. Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thi
ne,
    And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
    But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son-
  Ha
m. [aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind!
  King. How is it that the clouds still hang
 on you?
  Ham. Not so, my lord. I am too much i' th' sun.
  Queen. Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted 
colour off,
    And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
    Do not for ever with thy vail
ed lids
    Seek for thy noble father in the dust.
    Thou know'st 'tis common. All that lives mu
st die,
    Passing through nature to eternity.
  Ham. Ay, madam, it is common.
  Queen. If it be
,
    Why seems it so particular with thee?
  Ham. Seems, madam, Nay, it is. I know not 'seems.'

    'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
    Nor customary suits of solemn black,
    Nor wi
ndy suspiration of forc'd breath,
    No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
    Nor the dejected 
havior of the visage,
    Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
    'That can denote me
 truly. These indeed seem,
    For they are actions that a man might play;
    But I have that wit
hin which passeth show-
    These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
  King. 'Tis sweet and c
ommendable in your nature, Hamlet,
    To give these mourning duties to your father;
    But you m
ust know, your father lost a father;
    That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
    In
 filial obligation for some term
    To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever
    In obstinate con
dolement is a course
    Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief;
    It shows a will most inc
orrect to heaven,
    A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
    An understanding simple and unsch
ool'd;
    For what we know must be, and is as common
    As any the most vulgar thing to sense,

    Why should we in our peevish opposition
    Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
   
 A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
    To reason most absurd, whose common theme
    Is
 death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
    From the first corse till he that died to-day,
  
  'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth
    This unprevailing woe, and think of us
    As 
of a father; for let the world take note
    You are the most immediate to our throne,
    And wit
h no less nobility of love
    Than that which dearest father bears his son
    Do I impart toward
 you. For your intent
    In going back to school in Wittenberg,
    It is most retrograde to our 
desire;
    And we beseech you, bend you to remain
    Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,

    Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
  Queen. Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamle
t.
    I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.
  Ham. I shall in all my best obey you, mad
am.
  King. Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.
    Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come.
    T
his gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet
    Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,
    No jo
cund health that Denmark drinks to-day
    But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
    And 
the King's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,
    Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.
        
                        Flourish. Exeunt all but Hamlet.
  Ham. O that this too too solid flesh wou
ld melt,
    Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!
    Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
    H
is canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
    How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
    Seem
 to me all the uses of this world!
    Fie on't! ah, fie! 'Tis an unweeded garden
    That grows t
o seed; things rank and gross in nature
    Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
    Bu
t two months dead! Nay, not so much, not two.
    So excellent a king, that was to this
    Hyperi
on to a satyr; so loving to my mother
    That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
    Visit h
er face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
    Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him
    As if i
ncrease of appetite had grown
    By what it fed on; and yet, within a month-
    Let me not think
 on't! Frailty, thy name is woman!-
    A little month, or ere those shoes were old
    With which
 she followed my poor father's body
    Like Niobe, all tears- why she, even she
    (O God! a bea
st that wants discourse of reason
    Would have mourn'd longer) married with my uncle;
    My fat
her's brother, but no more like my father
    Than I to Hercules. Within a month,
    Ere yet the 
salt of most unrighteous tears
    Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
    She married. O, m
ost wicked speed, to post
    With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
    It is not, nor it cann
ot come to good.
    But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue!

          Enter Horatio, Mar
cellus, and Bernardo.

  Hor. Hail to your lordship!
  Ham. I am glad to see you well.
    Horat
io!- or I do forget myself.
  Hor. The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
  Ham. Sir, my g
ood friend- I'll change that name with you.
    And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?
    Ma
rcellus?
  Mar. My good lord!
  Ham. I am very glad to see you.- [To Bernardo] Good even, sir.-


    But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
  Hor. A truant disposition, good my lord.
  Ha
m. I would not hear your enemy say so,
    Nor shall you do my ear that violence
    To make it tr
uster of your own report
    Against yourself. I know you are no truant.
    But what is your affa
ir in Elsinore?
    We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
  Hor. My lord, I came to see yo
ur father's funeral.
  Ham. I prithee do not mock me, fellow student.
    I think it was to see my
 mother's wedding.
  Hor. Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.
  Ham. Thrift, thrift, Horatio! 
The funeral bak'd meats
    Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
    Would I had met my d
earest foe in heaven
    Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
    My father- methinks I see my fa
ther.
  Hor. O, where, my lord?
  Ham. In my mind's eye, Horatio.
  Hor. I saw him once. He was a
 goodly king.
  Ham. He was a man, take him for all in all.
    I shall not look upon his like aga
in.
  Hor. My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
  Ham. Saw? who?
  Hor. My lord, the King your
 father.
  Ham. The King my father?
  Hor. Season your admiration for a while
    With an attent 
ear, till I may deliver
    Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
    This marvel to you.
  Ham. F
or God's love let me hear!
  Hor. Two nights together had these gentlemen
    (Marcellus and Berna
rdo) on their watch
    In the dead vast and middle of the night
    Been thus encount'red. A figu
re like your father,
    Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
    Appears before them and with solemn
 march
    Goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walk'd
    By their oppress'd and fear-surpris
ed eyes,
    Within his truncheon's length; whilst they distill'd
    Almost to jelly with the act
 of fear,
    Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
    In dreadful secrecy impart they did,

    And I with them the third night kept the watch;
    Where, as they had deliver'd, both in tim
e,
    Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
    The apparition comes. I knew your fath
er.
    These hands are not more like.
  Ham. But where was this?
  Mar. My lord, upon the platfo
rm where we watch'd.
  Ham. Did you not speak to it?
  Hor. My lord, I did;
    But answer made i
t none. Yet once methought
    It lifted up it head and did address
    Itself to motion, like as 
it would speak;
    But even then the morning cock crew loud,
    And at the sound it shrunk in ha
ste away
    And vanish'd from our sight.
  Ham. 'Tis very strange.
  Hor. As I do live, my honou
r'd lord, 'tis true;
    And we did think it writ down in our duty
    To let you know of it.
  H
am. Indeed, indeed, sirs. But this troubles me.
    Hold you the watch to-night?
  Both [Mar. and 
Ber.] We do, my lord.
  Ham. Arm'd, say you?
  Both. Arm'd, my lord.
  Ham. From top to toe?
  B
oth. My lord, from head to foot.
  Ham. Then saw you not his face?
  Hor. O, yes, my lord! He wore
 his beaver up.
  Ham. What, look'd he frowningly.
  Hor. A countenance more in sorrow than in ang
er.
  Ham. Pale or red?
  Hor. Nay, very pale.
  Ham. And fix'd his eyes upon you?
  Hor. Most c
onstantly.
  Ham. I would I had been there.
  Hor. It would have much amaz'd you.
  Ham. Very lik
e, very like. Stay'd it long?
  Hor. While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
  Both. L
onger, longer.
  Hor. Not when I saw't.
  Ham. His beard was grizzled- no?
  Hor. It was, as I ha
ve seen it in his life,
    A sable silver'd.
  Ham. I will watch to-night.
    Perchance 'twill 
walk again.
  Hor. I warr'nt it will.
  Ham. If it assume my noble father's person,
    I'll spea
k to it, though hell itself should gape
    And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
    If you h
ave hitherto conceal'd this sight,
    Let it be tenable in your silence still;
    And whatsoever
 else shall hap to-night,
    Give it an understanding but no tongue.
    I will requite your love
s. So, fare you well.
    Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
    I'll visit you.
  All.
 Our duty to your honour.
  Ham. Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell.
                           
             Exeunt [all but Hamlet].
    My father's spirit- in arms? All is not well.
    I doub
t some foul play. Would the night were come!
    Till then sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise
,
    Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
Exit.




Scene III.
Elsinore. A r
oom in the house of Polonius.

Enter Laertes and Ophelia.

  Laer. My necessaries are embark'd. 
Farewell.
    And, sister, as the winds give benefit
    And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
 
   But let me hear from you.
  Oph. Do you doubt that?
  Laer. For Hamlet, and the trifling of his
 favour,
    Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood;
    A violet in the youth of primy nature,
  
  Forward, not permanent- sweet, not lasting;
    The perfume and suppliance of a minute;
    No m
ore.
  Oph. No more but so?
  Laer. Think it no more.
    For nature crescent does not grow alone

    In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,
    The inward service of the mind and soul
   
 Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
    And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
    The
 virtue of his will; but you must fear,
    His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
    Fo
r he himself is subject to his birth.
    He may not, as unvalued persons do,
    Carve for himsel
f, for on his choice depends
    The safety and health of this whole state,
    And therefore must
 his choice be circumscrib'd
    Unto the voice and yielding of that body
    Whereof he is the he
ad. Then if he says he loves you,
    It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
    As he in his pa
rticular act and place
    May give his saying deed; which is no further
    Than the main voice o
f Denmark goes withal.
    Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain
    If with too credent ea
r you list his songs,
    Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
    To his unmast'red i
mportunity.
    Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
    And keep you in the rear of your af
fection,
    Out of the shot and danger of desire.
    The chariest maid is prodigal enough
    I
f she unmask her beauty to the moon.
    Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes.
    The cank
er galls the infants of the spring
    Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd,
    And in the m
orn and liquid dew of youth
    Contagious blastments are most imminent.
    Be wary then; best sa
fety lies in fear.
    Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
  Oph. I shall th' effect of
 this good lesson keep
    As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
    Do not as some ungra
cious pastors do,
    Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven,
    Whiles, like a puff'd and re
ckless libertine,
    Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads
    And recks not his own rede
.
  Laer. O, fear me not!

                       Enter Polonius.

    I stay too long. But her
e my father comes.
    A double blessing is a double grace;
    Occasion smiles upon a second leav
e.
  Pol. Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame!
    The wind sits in the shoulder of your 
sail,
    And you are stay'd for. There- my blessing with thee!
    And these few precepts in thy 
memory
    Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
    Nor any unproportion'd thought hi
s act.
    Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar:
    Those friends thou hast, and their adopti
on tried,
    Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel;
    But do not dull thy palm with en
tertainment
    Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware
    Of entrance to a quarrel; but b
eing in,
    Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee.
    Give every man thine ear, but few thy
 voice;
    Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
    Costly thy habit as thy purse c
an buy,
    But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
    For the apparel oft proclaims the man
,
    And they in France of the best rank and station
    Are most select and generous, chief in t
hat.
    Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
    For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
    A
nd borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
    This above all- to thine own self be true,
    And i
t must follow, as the night the day,
    Thou canst not then be false to any man.
    Farewell. My
 blessing season this in thee!
  Laer. Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
  Pol. The time in
vites you. Go, your servants tend.
  Laer. Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well
    What I have sa
id to you.
  Oph. 'Tis in my memory lock'd,
    And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
  Laer
. Farewell.                                          Exit.
  Pol. What is't, Ophelia, he hath said 
to you?
  Oph. So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
  Pol. Marry, well bethought!
 
   'Tis told me he hath very oft of late
    Given private time to you, and you yourself
    Have 
of your audience been most free and bounteous.
    If it be so- as so 'tis put on me,
    And that
 in way of caution- I must tell you
    You do not understand yourself so clearly
    As it behoov
es my daughter and your honour.
    What is between you? Give me up the truth.
  Oph. He hath, my 
lord, of late made many tenders
    Of his affection to me.
  Pol. Affection? Pooh! You speak like
 a green girl,
    Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
    Do you believe his tenders, as you 
call them?
  Oph. I do not know, my lord, what I should think,
  Pol. Marry, I will teach you! Thi
nk yourself a baby
    That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
    Which are not sterling.
 Tender yourself more dearly,
    Or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
    Running it thu
s) you'll tender me a fool.
  Oph. My lord, he hath importun'd me with love
    In honourable fash
ion.
  Pol. Ay, fashion you may call it. Go to, go to!
  Oph. And hath given countenance to his sp
eech, my lord,
    With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
  Pol. Ay, springes to catch woodcocks
! I do know,
    When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
    Lends the tongue vows. These blaz
es, daughter,
    Giving more light than heat, extinct in both
    Even in their promise, as it is
 a-making,
    You must not take for fire. From this time
    Be something scanter of your maiden 
presence.
    Set your entreatments at a higher rate
    Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet
,
    Believe so much in him, that he is young,
    And with a larger tether may he walk
    Than
 may be given you. In few, Ophelia,
    Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
    Not of 
that dye which their investments show,
    But mere implorators of unholy suits,
    Breathing lik
e sanctified and pious bawds,
    The better to beguile. This is for all:
    I would not, in plai
n terms, from this time forth
    Have you so slander any moment leisure
    As to give words or t
alk with the Lord Hamlet.
    Look to't, I charge you. Come your ways.
  Oph. I shall obey, my lor
d.
                                                         Exeunt.




Scene IV.
Elsinore. T
he platform before the Castle.

Enter Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus.

  Ham. The air bites shre
wdly; it is very cold.
  Hor. It is a nipping and an eager air.
  Ham. What hour now?
  Hor. I th
ink it lacks of twelve.
  Mar. No, it is struck.
  Hor. Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws near
 the season
    Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
                   A flourish of trumpet
s, and two pieces go off.
    What does this mean, my lord?
  Ham. The King doth wake to-night and
 takes his rouse,
    Keeps wassail, and the swagg'ring upspring reels,
    And, as he drains his 
draughts of Rhenish down,
    The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out
    The triumph of his pled
ge.
  Hor. Is it a custom?
  Ham. Ay, marry, is't;
    But to my mind, though I am native here
 
   And to the manner born, it is a custom
    More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
   
 This heavy-headed revel east and west
    Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations;
    They 
clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase
    Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
    From our 
achievements, though perform'd at height,
    The pith and marrow of our attribute.
    So oft it 
chances in particular men
    That, for some vicious mole of nature in them,
    As in their birth
,- wherein they are not guilty,
    Since nature cannot choose his origin,-
    By the o'ergrowth 
of some complexion,
    Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
    Or by some habit that
 too much o'erleavens
    The form of plausive manners, that these men
    Carrying, I say, the st
amp of one defect,
    Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,
    Their virtues else- be they a
s pure as grace,
    As infinite as man may undergo-
    Shall in the general censure take corrupt
ion
    From that particular fault. The dram of e'il
    Doth all the noble substance often dout T
o his own scandal.

                         Enter Ghost.

  Hor. Look, my lord, it comes!
  Ha
m. Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
    Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
    B
ring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
    Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
    
Thou com'st in such a questionable shape
    That I will speak to thee. I'll call thee Hamlet,
   
 King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me?
    Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell
    Why thy c
anoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,
    Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre
    Wherein we
 saw thee quietly inurn'd,
    Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws
    To cast thee up again. 
What may this mean
    That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,
    Revisits thus the glimp
ses of the moon,
    Making night hideous, and we fools of nature
    So horridly to shake our dis
position
    With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
    Say, why is this? wherefore? What 
should we do?
                                           Ghost beckons Hamlet.
  Hor. It beckons y
ou to go away with it,
    As if it some impartment did desire
    To you alone.
  Mar. Look with
 what courteous action
    It waves you to a more removed ground.
    But do not go with it!
  Ho
r. No, by no means!
  Ham. It will not speak. Then will I follow it.
  Hor. Do not, my lord!
  Ha
m. Why, what should be the fear?
    I do not set my life at a pin's fee;
    And for my soul, wha
t can it do to that,
    Being a thing immortal as itself?
    It waves me forth again. I'll follo
w it.
  Hor. What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
    Or to the dreadful summit of the 
cliff
    That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
    And there assume some other, horrible form

    Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
    And draw you into madness? Think of it.
  
  The very place puts toys of desperation,
    Without more motive, into every brain
    That look
s so many fadoms to the sea
    And hears it roar beneath.
  Ham. It waves me still.
    Go on. I
'll follow thee.
  Mar. You shall not go, my lord.
  Ham. Hold off your hands!
  Hor. Be rul'd. Y
ou shall not go.
  Ham. My fate cries out
    And makes each petty artire in this body
    As har
dy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
                                                [Ghost beckons.]


    Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
    By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!-

    I say, away!- Go on. I'll follow thee.
                                        Exeunt Ghost a
nd Hamlet.
  Hor. He waxes desperate with imagination.
  Mar. Let's follow. 'Tis not fit thus to o
bey him.
  Hor. Have after. To what issue will this come?
  Mar. Something is rotten in the state 
of Denmark.
  Hor. Heaven will direct it.
  Mar. Nay, let's follow him.
                         
                                Exeunt.




Scene V.
Elsinore. The Castle. Another part of the
 fortifications.

Enter Ghost and Hamlet.

  Ham. Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak! I'll go no f
urther.
  Ghost. Mark me.
  Ham. I will.
  Ghost. My hour is almost come,
    When I to sulph'ro
us and tormenting flames
    Must render up myself.
  Ham. Alas, poor ghost!
  Ghost. Pity me not
, but lend thy serious hearing
    To what I shall unfold.
  Ham. Speak. I am bound to hear.
  Gh
ost. So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
  Ham. What?
  Ghost. I am thy father's spirit,

    Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
    And for the day confin'd to fast in fires,

    Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
    Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am for
bid
    To tell the secrets of my prison house,
    I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
   
 Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
    Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from th
eir spheres,
    Thy knotted and combined locks to part,
    And each particular hair to stand on 
end
    Like quills upon the fretful porcupine.
    But this eternal blazon must not be
    To ea
rs of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
    If thou didst ever thy dear father love-
  Ham. O 
God!
  Ghost. Revenge his foul and most unnatural murther.
  Ham. Murther?
  Ghost. Murther most 
foul, as in the best it is;
    But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.
  Ham. Haste me to kno
w't, that I, with wings as swift
    As meditation or the thoughts of love,
    May sweep to my re
venge.
  Ghost. I find thee apt;
    And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
    That rots 
itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
    Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.
    'Tis give
n out that, sleeping in my orchard,
    A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark
    Is by 
a forged process of my death
    Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth,
    The serpent that d
id sting thy father's life
    Now wears his crown.
  Ham. O my prophetic soul!
    My uncle?
  
Ghost. Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
    With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous 
gifts-
    O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
    So to seduce!- won to his shameful lust

    The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.
    O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there,
    
From me, whose love was of that dignity
    That it went hand in hand even with the vow
    I made
 to her in marriage, and to decline
    Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
    To those o
f mine!
    But virtue, as it never will be mov'd,
    Though lewdness court it in a shape of heav
en,
    So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
    Will sate itself in a celestial bed
    An
d prey on garbage.
    But soft! methinks I scent the morning air.
    Brief let me be. Sleeping w
ithin my orchard,
    My custom always of the afternoon,
    Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,

    With juice of cursed hebona in a vial,
    And in the porches of my ears did pour
    The lep
erous distilment; whose effect
    Holds such an enmity with blood of man
    That swift as quicks
ilver it courses through
    The natural gates and alleys of the body,
    And with a sudden vigou
r it doth posset
    And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
    The thin and wholesome blood. S
o did it mine;
    And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
    Most lazar-like, with vile and loat
hsome crust
    All my smooth body.
    Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
    Of life, of
 crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd;
    Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
    Unhous'led, 
disappointed, unanel'd,
    No reckoning made, but sent to my account
    With all my imperfection
s on my head.
  Ham. O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
  Ghost. If thou hast nature in thee
, bear it not.
    Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
    A couch for luxury and damned incest.

    But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
    Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
    A
gainst thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven,
    And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge
    
To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once.
    The glowworm shows the matin to be near
    An
d gins to pale his uneffectual fire.
    Adieu, adieu, adieu! Remember me.                      Exi
t.

  Ham. O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?
    And shall I couple hell? Hold, hold,
 my heart!
    And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
    But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee
?
    Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
    In this distracted globe. Remember thee?

    Yea, from the table of my memory
    I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
    All saws of
 books, all forms, all pressures past
    That youth and observation copied there,
    And thy com
mandment all alone shall live
    Within the book and volume of my brain,
    Unmix'd with baser m
atter. Yes, by heaven!
    O most pernicious woman!
    O villain, villain, smiling, damned villai
n!
    My tables! Meet it is I set it down
    That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
 
   At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark.        [Writes.]
    So, uncle, there you are. Now t
o my word:
    It is 'Adieu, adieu! Remember me.'
    I have sworn't.
  Hor. (within) My lord, my
 lord!

                   Enter Horatio and Marcellus.

  Mar. Lord Hamlet!
  Hor. Heaven secu
re him!
  Ham. So be it!
  Mar. Illo, ho, ho, my lord!
  Ham. Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, com
e.
  Mar. How is't, my noble lord?
  Hor. What news, my lord?
  Mar. O, wonderful!
  Hor. Good m
y lord, tell it.
  Ham. No, you will reveal it.
  Hor. Not I, my lord, by heaven!
  Mar. Nor I, m
y lord.
  Ham. How say you then? Would heart of man once think it?
    But you'll be secret?
  Bo
th. Ay, by heaven, my lord.
  Ham. There's neer a villain dwelling in all Denmark
    But he's an 
arrant knave.
  Hor. There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
    To tell us this.
  Ha
m. Why, right! You are in the right!
    And so, without more circumstance at all,
    I hold it f
it that we shake hands and part;
    You, as your business and desires shall point you,
    For ev
ery man hath business and desire,
    Such as it is; and for my own poor part,
    Look you, I'll 
go pray.
  Hor. These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
  Ham. I am sorry they offend you,
 heartily;
    Yes, faith, heartily.
  Hor. There's no offence, my lord.
  Ham. Yes, by Saint Pat
rick, but there is, Horatio,
    And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
    It is an hon
est ghost, that let me tell you.
    For your desire to know what is between us,
    O'ermaster't 
as you may. And now, good friends,
    As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,
    Give me one
 poor request.
  Hor. What is't, my lord? We will.
  Ham. Never make known what you have seen to-n
ight.
  Both. My lord, we will not.
  Ham. Nay, but swear't.
  Hor. In faith,
    My lord, not I
.
  Mar. Nor I, my lord- in faith.
  Ham. Upon my sword.
  Mar. We have sworn, my lord, already.

  Ham. Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.

                 Ghost cries under the stage.

  Ghost. 
Swear.
  Ham. Aha boy, say'st thou so? Art thou there, truepenny?
    Come on! You hear this fello
w in the cellarage.
    Consent to swear.
  Hor. Propose the oath, my lord.
  Ham. Never to speak
 of this that you have seen.
    Swear by my sword.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
  Ham. Hic et ubiqu
e? Then we'll shift our ground.
    Come hither, gentlemen,
    And lay your hands again upon my s
word.
    Never to speak of this that you have heard:
    Swear by my sword.
  Ghost. [beneath] S
wear by his sword.
  Ham. Well said, old mole! Canst work i' th' earth so fast?
    A worthy pione
r! Once more remove, good friends."
  Hor. O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
  Ham. A
nd therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
    There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,

    Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
    But come!
    Here, as before, never, so help you
 mercy,
    How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself
    (As I perchance hereafter shall think meet

    To put an antic disposition on),
    That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
    Wit
h arms encumb'red thus, or this head-shake,
    Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
    As 
'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'
    Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, a
n if they might,'
    Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
    That you know aught of me- this is
 not to do,
    So grace and mercy at your most need help you,
    Swear.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swea
r.
                                                   [They swear.]
  Ham. Rest, rest, perturbed s
pirit! So, gentlemen,
    With all my love I do commend me to you;
    And what so poor a man as H
amlet is
    May do t' express his love and friending to you,
    God willing, shall not lack. Let
 us go in together;
    And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
    The time is out of joint.
 O cursed spite
    That ever I was born to set it right!
    Nay, come, let's go together.
     
                                                    Exeunt.

Act II. Scene I.
E
lsinore. A room in the house of Polonius.

Enter Polonius and Reynaldo.

  Pol. Give him this mo
ney and these notes, Reynaldo.
  Rey. I will, my lord.
  Pol. You shall do marvell's wisely, good 
Reynaldo,
    Before You visit him, to make inquire
    Of his behaviour.
  Rey. My lord, I did i
ntend it.
  Pol. Marry, well said, very well said. Look you, sir,
    Enquire me first what Danske
rs are in Paris;
    And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
    What company, at what 
expense; and finding
    By this encompassment and drift of question
    That they do know my son,
 come you more nearer
    Than your particular demands will touch it.
    Take you, as 'twere, som
e distant knowledge of him;
    As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
    And in part him.'
 Do you mark this, Reynaldo?
  Rey. Ay, very well, my lord.
  Pol. 'And in part him, but,' you may
 say, 'not well.
    But if't be he I mean, he's very wild
    Addicted so and so'; and there put 
on him
    What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
    As may dishonour him- take heed of t
hat;
    But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips
    As are companions noted and most known

    To youth and liberty.
  Rey. As gaming, my lord.
  Pol. Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, qu
arrelling,
    Drabbing. You may go so far.
  Rey. My lord, that would dishonour him.
  Pol. Fait
h, no, as you may season it in the charge.
    You must not put another scandal on him,
    That h
e is open to incontinency.
    That's not my meaning. But breathe his faults so quaintly
    That 
they may seem the taints of liberty,
    The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
    A savageness 
in unreclaimed blood,
    Of general assault.
  Rey. But, my good lord-
  Pol. Wherefore should y
ou do this?
  Rey. Ay, my lord,
    I would know that.
  Pol. Marry, sir, here's my drift,
    A
nd I believe it is a fetch of warrant.
    You laying these slight sullies on my son
    As 'twere
 a thing a little soil'd i' th' working,
    Mark you,
    Your party in converse, him you would s
ound,
    Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
    The youth you breathe of guilty, be assur
'd
    He closes with you in this consequence:
    'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman'-

    According to the phrase or the addition
    Of man and country-
  Rey. Very good, my lord.

  Pol. And then, sir, does 'a this- 'a does- What was I about to
say?
    By the mass, I was about
 to say something! Where did I leave?
  Rey. At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,' and

    gentleman.'
  Pol. At 'closes in the consequence'- Ay, marry!
    He closes thus: 'I know th
e gentleman.
    I saw him yesterday, or t'other day,
    Or then, or then, with such or such; and
, as you say,
    There was 'a gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
    There falling out at tennis'
; or perchance,
    'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'
    Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.

    See you now-
    Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth;
    And thus do we of wisd
om and of reach,
    With windlasses and with assays of bias,
    By indirections find directions 
out.
    So, by my former lecture and advice,
    Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?
  
Rey. My lord, I have.
  Pol. God b' wi' ye, fare ye well!
  Rey. Good my lord!                    
                [Going.]
  Pol. Observe his inclination in yourself.
  Rey. I shall, my lord.
  P
ol. And let him ply his music.
  Rey. Well, my lord.
  Pol. Farewell!
                           
                       Exit Reynaldo.

                       Enter Ophelia.

    How now, Ophel
ia? What's the matter?
  Oph. O my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
  Pol. With what, i' 
th' name of God?
  Oph. My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
    Lord Hamlet, with his doublet a
ll unbrac'd,
    No hat upon his head, his stockings foul'd,
    Ungart'red, and down-gyved to his
 ankle;
    Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,
    And with a look so piteous in pu
rport
    As if he had been loosed out of hell
    To speak of horrors- he comes before me.
  Pol
. Mad for thy love?
  Oph. My lord, I do not know,
    But truly I do fear it.
  Pol. What said h
e?
  Oph. He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
    Then goes he to the length of all his arm,

    And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
    He falls to such perusal of my face
    As 
he would draw it. Long stay'd he so.
    At last, a little shaking of mine arm,
    And thrice his
 head thus waving up and down,
    He rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound
    As it did seem to 
shatter all his bulk
    And end his being. That done, he lets me go,
    And with his head over h
is shoulder turn'd
    He seem'd to find his way without his eyes,
    For out o' doors he went wi
thout their help
    And to the last bended their light on me.
  Pol. Come, go with me. I will go 
seek the King.
    This is the very ecstasy of love,
    Whose violent property fordoes itself
  
  And leads the will to desperate undertakings
    As oft as any passion under heaven
    That doe
s afflict our natures. I am sorry.
    What, have you given him any hard words of late?
  Oph. No,
 my good lord; but, as you did command,
    I did repel his letters and denied
    His access to m
e.
  Pol. That hath made him mad.
    I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
    I had not
 quoted him. I fear'd he did but trifle
    And meant to wrack thee; but beshrew my jealousy!
    
By heaven, it is as proper to our age
    To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
    As it is co
mmon for the younger sort
    To lack discretion. Come, go we to the King.
    This must be known;
 which, being kept close, might move
    More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
    Come.
  
                                                       Exeunt.

Scene II.
Elsinore. A room in the
 Castle.

Flourish. [Enter King and Queen, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern,
cum aliis.

  King. We
lcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
    Moreover that we much did long to see you,
    The n
eed we have to use you did provoke
    Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
    Of Hamlet's
 transformation. So I call it,
    Sith nor th' exterior nor the inward man
    Resembles that it 
was. What it should be,
    More than his father's death, that thus hath put him
    So much from 
th' understanding of himself,
    I cannot dream of. I entreat you both
    That, being of so youn
g days brought up with him,
    And since so neighbour'd to his youth and haviour,
    That you vo
uchsafe your rest here in our court
    Some little time; so by your companies
    To draw him on 
to pleasures, and to gather
    So much as from occasion you may glean,
    Whether aught to us un
known afflicts him thus
    That, open'd, lies within our remedy.
  Queen. Good gentlemen, he hath
 much talk'd of you,
    And sure I am two men there are not living
    To whom he more adheres. I
f it will please you
    To show us so much gentry and good will
    As to expend your time with u
s awhile
    For the supply and profit of our hope,
    Your visitation shall receive such thanks

    As fits a king's remembrance.
  Ros. Both your Majesties
    Might, by the sovereign power yo
u have of us,
    Put your dread pleasures more into command
    Than to entreaty.
  Guil. But we
 both obey,
    And here give up ourselves, in the full bent,
    To lay our service freely at you
r feet,
    To be commanded.
  King. Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
  Queen. Thanks
, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz.
    And I beseech you instantly to visit
    My too much ch
anged son.- Go, some of you,
    And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
  Guil. Heavens make o
ur presence and our practices
    Pleasant and helpful to him!
  Queen. Ay, amen!
               
  Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, [with some
                                                 
   Attendants].

                         Enter Polonius.

  Pol. Th' ambassadors from Norway, m
y good lord,
    Are joyfully return'd.
  King. Thou still hast been the father of good news.
  P
ol. Have I, my lord? Assure you, my good liege,
    I hold my duty as I hold my soul,
    Both to 
my God and to my gracious king;
    And I do think- or else this brain of mine
    Hunts not the t
rail of policy so sure
    As it hath us'd to do- that I have found
    The very cause of Hamlet's
 lunacy.
  King. O, speak of that! That do I long to hear.
  Pol. Give first admittance to th' amb
assadors.
    My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
  King. Thyself do grace to them, an
d bring them in.
                                                [Exit Polonius.]
    He tells me,
 my dear Gertrude, he hath found
    The head and source of all your son's distemper.
  Queen. I d
oubt it is no other but the main,
    His father's death and our o'erhasty marriage.
  King. Well,
 we shall sift him.

              Enter Polonius, Voltemand, and Cornelius.

    Welcome, my go
od friends.
    Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?
  Volt. Most fair return of greeting
s and desires.
    Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
    His nephew's levies; which to him a
ppear'd
    To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack,
    But better look'd into, he truly found
  
  It was against your Highness; whereat griev'd,
    That so his sickness, age, and impotence
    
Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
    On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys,
    Rec
eives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,
    Makes vow before his uncle never more
    To give th' 
assay of arms against your Majesty.
    Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
    Gives him three
 thousand crowns in annual fee
    And his commission to employ those soldiers,
    So levied as b
efore, against the Polack;
    With an entreaty, herein further shown,
                           
                     [Gives a paper.]
    That it might please you to give quiet pass
    Through 
your dominions for this enterprise,
    On such regards of safety and allowance
    As therein are
 set down.
  King. It likes us well;
    And at our more consider'd time we'll read,
    Answer, 
and think upon this business.
    Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour.
    Go to your 
rest; at night we'll feast together.
    Most welcome home!                       Exeunt Ambassador
s.
  Pol. This business is well ended.
    My liege, and madam, to expostulate
    What majesty s
hould be, what duty is,
    Why day is day, night is night, and time is time.
    Were nothing but
 to waste night, day, and time.
    Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
    And tediousne
ss the limbs and outward flourishes,
    I will be brief. Your noble son is mad.
    Mad call I it
; for, to define true madness,
    What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
    But let that go.

  Queen. More matter, with less art.
  Pol. Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
    That he is ma
d, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
    And pity 'tis 'tis true. A foolish figure!
    But farewell
 it, for I will use no art.
    Mad let us grant him then. And now remains
    That we find out th
e cause of this effect-
    Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
    For this effect defective
 comes by cause.
    Thus it remains, and the remainder thus.
    Perpend.
    I have a daughter 
(have while she is mine),
    Who in her duty and obedience, mark,
    Hath given me this. Now gat
her, and surmise.
                                             [Reads] the letter.
    'To the cel
estial, and my soul's idol, the most beautified
      Ophelia,'-

    That's an ill phrase, a vil
e phrase; 'beautified' is a vile
      phrase.
    But you shall hear. Thus:
                    
                                    [Reads.]
    'In her excellent white bosom, these, &c.'
  Quee
n. Came this from Hamlet to her?
  Pol. Good madam, stay awhile. I will be faithful.     [Reads.]



          'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
            Doubt that the sun doth move;
          
Doubt truth to be a liar;
            But never doubt I love.
      'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at t
hese numbers; I have not art
to
    reckon my groans; but that I love thee best, O most best,
bel
ieve
    it. Adieu.
      'Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to
him,

HAML
ET.'

    This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me;
    And more above, hath his solicitings
,
    As they fell out by time, by means, and place,
    All given to mine ear.
  King. But how h
ath she
    Receiv'd his love?
  Pol. What do you think of me?
  King. As of a man faithful and h
onourable.
  Pol. I would fain prove so. But what might you think,
    When I had seen this hot lo
ve on the wing
    (As I perceiv'd it, I must tell you that,
    Before my daughter told me), what
 might you,
    Or my dear Majesty your queen here, think,
    If I had play'd the desk or table b
ook,
    Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
    Or look'd upon this love with idle sight?

    What might you think? No, I went round to work
    And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:

    'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star.
    This must not be.' And then I prescripts gave h
er,
    That she should lock herself from his resort,
    Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.

    Which done, she took the fruits of my advice,
    And he, repulsed, a short tale to make,
   
 Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
    Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
    Thence 
to a lightness, and, by this declension,
    Into the madness wherein now he raves,
    And all we
 mourn for.
  King. Do you think 'tis this?
  Queen. it may be, very like.
  Pol. Hath there been
 such a time- I would fain know that-
    That I have Positively said ''Tis so,'
    When it prov'
d otherwise.?
  King. Not that I know.
  Pol. [points to his head and shoulder] Take this from thi
s, if
this
      be otherwise.
    If circumstances lead me, I will find
    Where truth is hid,
 though it were hid indeed
    Within the centre.
  King. How may we try it further?
  Pol. You k
now sometimes he walks for hours together
    Here in the lobby.
  Queen. So he does indeed.
  Po
l. At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him.
    Be you and I behind an arras then.
    Mark t
he encounter. If he love her not,
    And he not from his reason fall'n thereon
    Let me be no a
ssistant for a state,
    But keep a farm and carters.
  King. We will try it.

                
 Enter Hamlet, reading on a book.

  Queen. But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
 
 Pol. Away, I do beseech you, both away
    I'll board him presently. O, give me leave.
          
             Exeunt King and Queen, [with Attendants].
    How does my good Lord Hamlet?
  Ham. We
ll, God-a-mercy.
  Pol. Do you know me, my lord?
  Ham. Excellent well. You are a fishmonger.
  P
ol. Not I, my lord.
  Ham. Then I would you were so honest a man.
  Pol. Honest, my lord?
  Ham. 
Ay, sir. To be honest, as this world goes, is to be one
man
    pick'd out of ten thousand.
  Pol
. That's very true, my lord.
  Ham. For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god
    ki
ssing carrion- Have you a daughter?
  Pol. I have, my lord.
  Ham. Let her not walk i' th' sun. Co
nception is a blessing, but
not
    as your daughter may conceive. Friend, look to't.
  Pol. [asi
de] How say you by that? Still harping on my daughter.
Yet
    he knew me not at first. He said I 
was a fishmonger. He is
far
    gone, far gone! And truly in my youth I suff'red much
extremity

    for love- very near this. I'll speak to him again.- What do
you
    read, my lord?
  Ham. Wor
ds, words, words.
  Pol. What is the matter, my lord?
  Ham. Between who?
  Pol. I mean, the matt
er that you read, my lord.
  Ham. Slanders, sir; for the satirical rogue says here that old
men
 
   have grey beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes
    purging thick amber and plum-tre
e gum; and that they have a
    plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams. All
which,
 
   sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I
hold it
    not honesty to have it th
us set down; for you yourself, sir,
    should be old as I am if, like a crab, you could go backwar
d.

  Pol. [aside] Though this be madness, yet there is a method
in't.-
   Will You walk out of 
the air, my lord?
  Ham. Into my grave?
  Pol. Indeed, that is out o' th' air. [Aside] How pregnan
t
sometimes
    his replies are! a happiness that often madness hits on,
which
    reason and sa
nity could not so prosperously be delivered of.
I
    will leave him and suddenly contrive the mea
ns of meeting
between
    him and my daughter.- My honourable lord, I will most humbly
take
    
my leave of you.
  Ham. You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more
    willingly part
 withal- except my life, except my life, except
my
    life,

                    Enter Rosencra
ntz and Guildenstern.

  Pol. Fare you well, my lord.
  Ham. These tedious old fools!
  Pol. You
 go to seek the Lord Hamlet. There he is.
  Ros. [to Polonius] God save you, sir!
                
                                Exit [Polonius].

  Guil. My honour'd lord!
  Ros. My most dear l
ord!
  Ham. My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern?
Ah,
    Rosencrantz! Good lad
s, how do ye both?
  Ros. As the indifferent children of the earth.
  Guil. Happy in that we are n
ot over-happy.
    On Fortune's cap we are not the very button.
  Ham. Nor the soles of her shoe?

  Ros. Neither, my lord.
  Ham. Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her
    favour
s?
  Guil. Faith, her privates we.
  Ham. In the secret parts of Fortune? O! most true! she is a

    strumpet. What news ?
  Ros. None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
  Ham. Then is 
doomsday near! But your news is not true. Let me
    question more in particular. What have you, my
 good friends,
    deserved at the hands of Fortune that she sends you to prison
    hither?
  Gu
il. Prison, my lord?
  Ham. Denmark's a prison.
  Ros. Then is the world one.
  Ham. A goodly one
; in which there are many confines, wards, and
    dungeons, Denmark being one o' th' worst.
  Ros
. We think not so, my lord.
  Ham. Why, then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either
good
 
   or bad but thinking makes it so. To me it is a prison.
  Ros. Why, then your ambition makes it o
ne. 'Tis too narrow for
your
    mind.
  Ham. O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and count m
yself a
    king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.
  Guil. Which dreams indee
d are ambition; for the very substance
of
    the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
  Ha
m. A dream itself is but a shadow.
  Ros. Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality

that
    it is but a shadow's shadow.
  Ham. Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and

outstretch'd
    heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we to th' court? for, by
my
    fay, I cannot
 reason.
  Both. We'll wait upon you.
  Ham. No such matter! I will not sort you with the rest of 
my
    servants; for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most
    dreadfully attended. But i
n the beaten way of friendship,
what
    make you at Elsinore?
  Ros. To visit you, my lord; no o
ther occasion.
  Ham. Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank
you;
    and sure, 
dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny.
Were
    you not sent for? Is it your own inclin
ing? Is it a free
    visitation? Come, deal justly with me. Come, come! Nay,
speak.
  Guil. What
 should we say, my lord?
  Ham. Why, anything- but to th' purpose. You were sent for; and
    ther
e is a kind of confession in your looks, which your
modesties
    have not craft enough to colour.
 I know the good King and
Queen
    have sent for you.
  Ros. To what end, my lord?
  Ham. That 
you must teach me. But let me conjure you by the
rights
    of our fellowship, by the consonancy o
f our youth, by the
    obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear
a
    better
 proposer could charge you withal, be even and direct
with
    me, whether you were sent for or no
.
  Ros. [aside to Guildenstern] What say you?
  Ham. [aside] Nay then, I have an eye of you.- If 
you love me,
hold
    not off.
  Guil. My lord, we were sent for.
  Ham. I will tell you why. So
 shall my anticipation prevent your
    discovery, and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no

    feather. I have of late- but wherefore I know not- lost all
my
    mirth, forgone all custom 
of exercises; and indeed, it goes
so
    heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the

earth,
    seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy,
the
    air, look you, t
his brave o'erhanging firmament, this
majestical
    roof fretted with golden fire- why, it appear
eth no other
thing
    to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What
a
    piece
 of work is a man! how noble in reason! how infinite in
    faculties! in form and moving how expre
ss and admirable! in
    action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the
    beauty 
of the world, the paragon of animals! And yet to me
what
    is this quintessence of dust? Man del
ights not me- no, nor
woman
    neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.
  Ros. My lor
d, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.
  Ham. Why did you laugh then, when I said 'Man delights
 not me'?
  Ros. To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten
    entertainment the p
layers shall receive from you. We coted
them
    on the way, and hither are they coming to offer y
ou service.
  Ham. He that plays the king shall be welcome- his Majesty shall
    have tribute of 
me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil
and
    target; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the
 humorous man
shall
    end his part in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose
    lungs a
re tickle o' th' sere; and the lady shall say her mind
    freely, or the blank verse shall halt fo
r't. What players are
    they?
  Ros. Even those you were wont to take such delight in, the
    
tragedians of the city.
  Ham. How chances it they travel? Their residence, both in
    reputation
 and profit, was better both ways.
  Ros. I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late

    innovation.
  Ham. Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in
the
    city? Are 
they so follow'd?
  Ros. No indeed are they not.
  Ham. How comes it? Do they grow rusty?
  Ros. 
Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there
is,
    sir, an eyrie of children, little
 eyases, that cry out on the
top
    of question and are most tyrannically clapp'd for't. These
a
re now
    the fashion, and so berattle the common stages (so they call
    them) that many wearin
g rapiers are afraid of goosequills and
    dare scarce come thither.
  Ham. What, are they childr
en? Who maintains 'em? How are they
    escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they c
an
    sing? Will they not say afterwards, if they should grow
    themselves to common players (a
s it is most like, if their
means
    are no better), their writers do them wrong to make them
ex
claim
    against their own succession.
  Ros. Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and
 the
nation
    holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy. There was, for
a
    while, no mon
ey bid for argument unless the poet and the
player
    went to cuffs in the question.
  Ham. Is't
 possible?
  Guil. O, there has been much throwing about of brains.
  Ham. Do the boys carry it aw
ay?
  Ros. Ay, that they do, my lord- Hercules and his load too.
  Ham. It is not very strange; fo
r my uncle is King of Denmark,
and
    those that would make mows at him while my father lived giv
e
    twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his picture
in
    little. 'Sblood, there
 is something in this more than
natural, if
    philosophy could find it out.

                 
    Flourish for the Players.

  Guil. There are the players.
  Ham. Gentlemen, you are welcome t
o Elsinore. Your hands, come!
Th'
    appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me
com
ply
    with you in this garb, lest my extent to the players (which I
    tell you must show fairl
y outwards) should more appear like
    entertainment than yours. You are welcome. But my
uncle-fa
ther
    and aunt-mother are deceiv'd.
  Guil. In what, my dear lord?
  Ham. I am but mad north-n
orth-west. When the wind is southerly
I
    know a hawk from a handsaw.

                       
     Enter Polonius.

  Pol. Well be with you, gentlemen!
  Ham. Hark you, Guildenstern- and you 
too- at each ear a hearer!
    That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling
    c
louts.
  Ros. Happily he's the second time come to them; for they say an
old
    man is twice a c
hild.
  Ham. I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players. Mark
it.-
   You say right, sir;
 a Monday morning; twas so indeed.
  Pol. My lord, I have news to tell you.
  Ham. My lord, I have
 news to tell you. When Roscius was an
actor in
    Rome-
  Pol. The actors are come hither, my l
ord.
  Ham. Buzz, buzz!
  Pol. Upon my honour-
  Ham. Then came each actor on his ass-
  Pol. Th
e best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy,
    history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, hi
storical-pastoral,
    tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral;
scene
    indiv
idable, or poem unlimited. Seneca cannot be too heavy,
nor
    Plautus too light. For the law of w
rit and the liberty, these
are
    the only men.
  Ham. O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treas
ure hadst thou!
  Pol. What treasure had he, my lord?
  Ham. Why,

         'One fair daughter, 
and no more,
           The which he loved passing well.'

  Pol. [aside] Still on my daughter.

  Ham. Am I not i' th' right, old Jephthah?
  Pol. If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daugh
ter that I
    love passing well.
  Ham. Nay, that follows not.
  Pol. What follows then, my lord
?
  Ham. Why,

           'As by lot, God wot,'

 and then, you know,

           'It came to
 pass, as most like it was.'

    The first row of the pious chanson will show you more; for
look

    where my abridgment comes.

                     Enter four or five Players.

    You are 
welcome, masters; welcome, all.- I am glad to see
thee
    well.- Welcome, good friends.- O, my ol
d friend? Why, thy
face is
    valanc'd since I saw thee last. Com'st' thou to' beard me in
    D
enmark?- What, my young lady and mistress? By'r Lady, your
    ladyship is nearer to heaven than wh
en I saw you last by the
    altitude of a chopine. Pray God your voice, like a piece of
    uncur
rent gold, be not crack'd within the ring.- Masters, you
are
    all welcome. We'll e'en to't like
 French falconers, fly at
    anything we see. We'll have a speech straight. Come, give us
a
    
taste of your quality. Come, a passionate speech.
  1. Play. What speech, my good lord?
  Ham. I h
eard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never
acted;
    or if it was, not above once; for th
e play, I remember,
pleas'd
    not the million, 'twas caviary to the general; but it was (as
I

    receiv'd it, and others, whose judgments in such matters
cried in
    the top of mine) an exce
llent play, well digested in the
scenes,
    set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember 
one said
    there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter
savoury,
    nor no matter in 
the phrase that might indict the author of
    affectation; but call'd it an honest method, as whol
esome as
    sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech
in't
    I chiefly lov'd
. 'Twas AEneas' tale to Dido, and thereabout
of it
    especially where he speaks of Priam's slaug
hter. If it live
in
    your memory, begin at this line- let me see, let me see:

         'The 
rugged Pyrrhus, like th' Hyrcanian beast-'

    'Tis not so; it begins with Pyrrhus:

         '
The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
         Black as his purpose, did the night resemble
   
      When he lay couched in the ominous horse,
         Hath now this dread and black complexion s
mear'd
         With heraldry more dismal. Head to foot
         Now is be total gules, horridly t
rick'd
         With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
         Bak'd and impasted with 
the parching streets,
         That lend a tyrannous and a damned light
         To their lord's m
urther. Roasted in wrath and fire,
         And thus o'ersized with coagulate gore,
         With 
eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
         Old grandsire Priam seeks.'

    So, proceed y
ou.
  Pol. Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good
     discretion.

  1. Play
. 'Anon he finds him,
      Striking too short at Greeks. His antique sword,
      Rebellious to h
is arm, lies where it falls,
      Repugnant to command. Unequal match'd,
      Pyrrhus at Priam d
rives, in rage strikes wide;
      But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
      Th' unnerve
d father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
      Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
      Stoo
ps to his base, and with a hideous crash
      Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear. For lo! his sword,
   
   Which was declining on the milky head
      Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' th' air to stick.
    
  So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
      And, like a neutral to his will and matter,
      
Did nothing.
      But, as we often see, against some storm,
      A silence in the heavens, the r
ack stand still,
      The bold winds speechless, and the orb below
      As hush as death- anon t
he dreadful thunder
      Doth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
      Aroused vengeance 
sets him new awork;
      And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
      On Mars's armour, forg'd f
or proof eterne,
      With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
      Now falls on Priam.
 
     Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods,
      In general synod take away her power;
  
    Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
      And bowl the round nave down the hill of
 heaven,
      As low as to the fiends!

  Pol. This is too long.
  Ham. It shall to the barber'
s, with your beard.- Prithee say
on.
    He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps. Say on;

come to
    Hecuba.

  1. Play. 'But who, O who, had seen the mobled queen-'

  Ham. 'The mob
led queen'?
  Pol. That's good! 'Mobled queen' is good.

  1. Play. 'Run barefoot up and down, th
reat'ning the flames
      With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head
      Where late the diadem s
tood, and for a robe,
      About her lank and all o'erteemed loins,
      A blanket, in the alarm
 of fear caught up-
      Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd
      'Gainst Fortune's 
state would treason have pronounc'd.
      But if the gods themselves did see her then,
      When
 she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
      In Mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,
      T
he instant burst of clamour that she made
      (Unless things mortal move them not at all)
      
Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven
      And passion in the gods.'

  Pol. Look, wh
e'r he has not turn'd his colour, and has tears
in's
    eyes. Prithee no more!
  Ham. 'Tis well.
 I'll have thee speak out the rest of this
soon.-
    Good my lord, will you see the players well 
bestow'd? Do you
    hear? Let them be well us'd; for they are the abstract and
brief
    chronic
les of the time. After your death you were better have
a
    bad epitaph than their ill report whi
le you live.
  Pol. My lord, I will use them according to their desert.
  Ham. God's bodykins, man
, much better! Use every man after his
    desert, and who should scape whipping? Use them after yo
ur
own
    honour and dignity. The less they deserve, the more merit is
in
    your bounty. Take
 them in.
  Pol. Come, sirs.
  Ham. Follow him, friends. We'll hear a play to-morrow.
           
      Exeunt Polonius and Players [except the First].
    Dost thou hear me, old friend? Can you pl
ay 'The Murther of
    Gonzago'?
  1. Play. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. We'll ha't to-morrow night. You c
ould, for a need, study a
    speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which I would set down
and
  
  insert in't, could you not?
  1. Play. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Very well. Follow that lord- and look
 you mock him not.
                                            [Exit First Player.]
    My good fr
iends, I'll leave you till night. You are welcome
to
    Elsinore.
  Ros. Good my lord!
  Ham. A
y, so, God b' wi' ye!
                            [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
    Now I a
m alone.
    O what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
    Is it not monstrous that this player here,

    But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
    Could force his soul so to his own conceit
    
That, from her working, all his visage wann'd,
    Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
   
 A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
    With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!

    For Hecuba!
    What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
    That he should weep for her? What
 would he do,
    Had he the motive and the cue for passion
    That I have? He would drown the st
age with tears
    And cleave the general ear with horrid speech;
    Make mad the guilty and appa
l the free,
    Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed
    The very faculties of eyes and ears.

    Yet I,
    A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak
    Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my caus
e,
    And can say nothing! No, not for a king,
    Upon whose property and most dear life
    A 
damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
    Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
    Plucks
 off my beard and blows it in my face?
    Tweaks me by th' nose? gives me the lie i' th' throat
 
   As deep as to the lungs? Who does me this, ha?
    'Swounds, I should take it! for it cannot be

    But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall
    To make oppression bitter, or ere this
    I should
 have fatted all the region kites
    With this slave's offal. Bloody bawdy villain!
    Remorsele
ss, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
    O, vengeance!
    Why, what an ass am I! This is
 most brave,
    That I, the son of a dear father murther'd,
    Prompted to my revenge by heaven 
and hell,
    Must (like a whore) unpack my heart with words
    And fall a-cursing like a very dr
ab,
    A scullion!
    Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! Hum, I have heard
    That guilty creat
ures, sitting at a play,
    Have by the very cunning of the scene
    Been struck so to the soul 
that presently
    They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
    For murther, though it have no ton
gue, will speak
    With most miraculous organ, I'll have these Players
    Play something like th
e murther of my father
    Before mine uncle. I'll observe his looks;
    I'll tent him to the qui
ck. If he but blench,
    I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
    May be a devil; and th
e devil hath power
    T' assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
    Out of my weakness and my 
melancholy,
    As he is very potent with such spirits,
    Abuses me to damn me. I'll have ground
s
    More relative than this. The play's the thing
    Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the K
ing.         Exit.

ACT III. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter 
King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern,
and Lords.

  King. And can you by no 
drift of circumstance
    Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
    Grating so harshly all h
is days of quiet
    With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
  Ros. He does confess he feels himself 
distracted,
    But from what cause he will by no means speak.
  Guil. Nor do we find him forward 
to be sounded,
    But with a crafty madness keeps aloof
    When we would bring him on to some co
nfession
    Of his true state.
  Queen. Did he receive you well?
  Ros. Most like a gentleman.

  Guil. But with much forcing of his disposition.
  Ros. Niggard of question, but of our demands
 
   Most free in his reply.
  Queen. Did you assay him
    To any pastime?
  Ros. Madam, it so fel
l out that certain players
    We o'erraught on the way. Of these we told him,
    And there did s
eem in him a kind of joy
    To hear of it. They are here about the court,
    And, as I think, th
ey have already order
    This night to play before him.
  Pol. 'Tis most true;
    And he beseec
h'd me to entreat your Majesties
    To hear and see the matter.
  King. With all my heart, and it
 doth much content me
    To hear him so inclin'd.
    Good gentlemen, give him a further edge
  
  And drive his purpose on to these delights.
  Ros. We shall, my lord.
                          
  Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
  King. Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
    For we have close
ly sent for Hamlet hither,
    That he, as 'twere by accident, may here
    Affront Ophelia.
    
Her father and myself (lawful espials)
    Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing unseen,
    We ma
y of their encounter frankly judge
    And gather by him, as he is behav'd,
    If't be th' afflic
tion of his love, or no,
    That thus he suffers for.
  Queen. I shall obey you;
    And for you
r part, Ophelia, I do wish
    That your good beauties be the happy cause
    Of Hamlet's wildness
. So shall I hope your virtues
    Will bring him to his wonted way again,
    To both your honour
s.
  Oph. Madam, I wish it may.
                                                   [Exit Queen.]

  Pol. Ophelia, walk you here.- Gracious, so please you,
    We will bestow ourselves.- [To Ophelia
] Read on this book,
    That show of such an exercise may colour
    Your loneliness.- We are oft
 to blame in this,
    'Tis too much prov'd, that with devotion's visage
    And pious action we d
o sugar o'er
    The Devil himself.
  King. [aside] O, 'tis too true!
    How smart a lash that s
peech doth give my conscience!
    The harlot's cheek, beautied with plast'ring art,
    Is not mo
re ugly to the thing that helps it
    Than is my deed to my most painted word.
    O heavy burthe
n!
  Pol. I hear him coming. Let's withdraw, my lord.
                                      Exeunt
 King and Polonius].

                           Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. To be, or not to be- that
 is the question:
    Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
    The slings and arrows of outra
geous fortune
    Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
    And by opposing end them. To die-
 to sleep-
    No more; and by a sleep to say we end
    The heartache, and the thousand natural s
hocks
    That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation
    Devoutly to be wish'd. To die- to sleep.

    To sleep- perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub!
    For in that sleep of death what dreams 
may come
    When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
    Must give us pause. There's the respe
ct
    That makes calamity of so long life.
    For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,

    Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
    The pangs of despis'd love, the law's del
ay,
    The insolence of office, and the spurns
    That patient merit of th' unworthy takes,
   
 When he himself might his quietus make
    With a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear,
    
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
    But that the dread of something after death-
    The un
discover'd country, from whose bourn
    No traveller returns- puzzles the will,
    And makes us 
rather bear those ills we have
    Than fly to others that we know not of?
    Thus conscience doe
s make cowards of us all,
    And thus the native hue of resolution
    Is sicklied o'er with the 
pale cast of thought,
    And enterprises of great pith and moment
    With this regard their curr
ents turn awry
    And lose the name of action.- Soft you now!
    The fair Ophelia!- Nymph, in th
y orisons
    Be all my sins rememb'red.
  Oph. Good my lord,
    How does your honour for this m
any a day?
  Ham. I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
  Oph. My lord, I have remembrances of you
rs
    That I have longed long to re-deliver.
    I pray you, now receive them.
  Ham. No, not I!

    I never gave you aught.
  Oph. My honour'd lord, you know right well you did,
    And with t
hem words of so sweet breath compos'd
    As made the things more rich. Their perfume lost,
    Ta
ke these again; for to the noble mind
    Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
    There,
 my lord.
  Ham. Ha, ha! Are you honest?
  Oph. My lord?
  Ham. Are you fair?
  Oph. What means 
your lordship?
  Ham. That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit
no
    discourse 
to your beauty.
  Oph. Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with
honesty?
  Ham. Ay, 
truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform
    honesty from what it is to a bawd than the
 force of honesty
can
    translate beauty into his likeness. This was sometime a
paradox,
    b
ut now the time gives it proof. I did love you once.
  Oph. Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so
.
  Ham. You should not have believ'd me; for virtue cannot so
    inoculate our old stock but we 
shall relish of it. I loved
you
    not.
  Oph. I was the more deceived.
  Ham. Get thee to a nu
nnery! Why wouldst thou be a breeder of
    sinners? I am myself indifferent honest, but yet I coul
d
accuse
    me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne
me.
    I am very pro
ud, revengeful, ambitious; with more offences at
my
    beck than I have thoughts to put them in, 
imagination to give
    them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows
as I
    do,
 crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves
all;
    believe none of us. Go thy ways 
to a nunnery. Where's your
    father?
  Oph. At home, my lord.
  Ham. Let the doors be shut upon
 him, that he may play the fool
    nowhere but in's own house. Farewell.
  Oph. O, help him, you 
sweet heavens!
  Ham. If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy
dowry:
    be thou a
s chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not
escape
    calumny. Get thee to a nunnery. Go, fa
rewell. Or if thou wilt
    needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what
    mons
ters you make of them. To a nunnery, go; and quickly too.
    Farewell.
  Oph. O heavenly powers, 
restore him!
  Ham. I have heard of your paintings too, well enough. God hath
    given you one fa
ce, and you make yourselves another. You jig,
you
    amble, and you lisp; you nickname God's crea
tures and make
your
    wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't! it hath
made
    me
 mad. I say, we will have no more marriages. Those that are
    married already- all but one- shall
 live; the rest shall keep
as
    they are. To a nunnery, go.                            Exit.
  
Oph. O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
    The courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue
, sword,
    Th' expectancy and rose of the fair state,
    The glass of fashion and the mould of 
form,
    Th' observ'd of all observers- quite, quite down!
    And I, of ladies most deject and w
retched,
    That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
    Now see that noble and most sovereign re
ason,
    Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
    That unmatch'd form and feature of 
blown youth
    Blasted with ecstasy. O, woe is me
    T' have seen what I have seen, see what I s
ee!

                   Enter King and Polonius.

  King. Love? his affections do not that way t
end;
    Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,
    Was not like madness. There's some
thing in his soul
    O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
    And I do doubt the hatch and th
e disclose
    Will be some danger; which for to prevent,
    I have in quick determination
    T
hus set it down: he shall with speed to England
    For the demand of our neglected tribute.
    H
aply the seas, and countries different,
    With variable objects, shall expel
    This something-
settled matter in his heart,
    Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
    From fashion o
f himself. What think you on't?
  Pol. It shall do well. But yet do I believe
    The origin and c
ommencement of his grief
    Sprung from neglected love.- How now, Ophelia?
    You need not tell 
us what Lord Hamlet said.
    We heard it all.- My lord, do as you please;
    But if you hold it 
fit, after the play
    Let his queen mother all alone entreat him
    To show his grief. Let her 
be round with him;
    And I'll be plac'd so please you, in the ear
    Of all their conference. I
f she find him not,
    To England send him; or confine him where
    Your wisdom best shall think
.
  King. It shall be so.
    Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.         Exeunt.





Scene II.
Elsinore. hall in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet and three of the Players.

  Ham. Speak
 the speech, I pray you, as I pronounc'd it to you,
    trippingly on the tongue. But if you mouth 
it, as many of our
    players do, I had as live the town crier spoke my lines. Nor
do
    not sa
w the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all
    gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, 
and (as I may say)
    whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and beget a
    temperance that
 may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to
the
    soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fello
w tear a passion
to
    tatters, to very rags, to split the cars of the groundlings,
who
    (fo
r the most part) are capable of nothing but inexplicable
dumb
    shows and noise. I would have su
ch a fellow whipp'd for
o'erdoing
    Termagant. It out-herods Herod. Pray you avoid it.
  Player
. I warrant your honour.
  Ham. Be not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be
your
    
tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the action;
with
    this special observance, that
 you o'erstep not the modesty of
    nature: for anything so overdone is from the purpose of
playi
ng,
    whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as
    'twere, the mirror up to
 nature; to show Virtue her own
feature,
    scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the
 time
his
    form and pressure. Now this overdone, or come tardy off,
though
    it make the un
skilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious
    grieve; the censure of the which one must in your 
allowance
    o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that
I
    have seen play,
 and heard others praise, and that highly (not
to
    speak it profanely), that, neither having th
e accent of
    Christians, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have
so
    strutted and b
ellowed that I have thought some of Nature's
    journeymen had made men, and not made them well, t
hey
imitated
    humanity so abominably.
  Player. I hope we have reform'd that indifferently wit
h us,
sir.
  Ham. O, reform it altogether! And let those that play your
clowns
    speak no more
 than is set down for them. For there be of them
    that will themselves laugh, to set on some qua
ntity of barren
    spectators to laugh too, though in the mean time some
necessary
    question 
of the play be then to be considered. That's
villanous
    and shows a most pitiful ambition in th
e fool that uses it.
Go
    make you ready.
                                                 Exeu
nt Players.

            Enter Polonius, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.

    How now, my lord? W
ill the King hear this piece of work?
  Pol. And the Queen too, and that presently.
  Ham. Bid the
 players make haste, [Exit Polonius.] Will you two
    help to hasten them?
  Both. We will, my lo
rd.                       Exeunt they two.
  Ham. What, ho, Horatio!

                      Enter
 Horatio.

  Hor. Here, sweet lord, at your service.
  Ham. Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man

    As e'er my conversation cop'd withal.
  Hor. O, my dear lord!
  Ham. Nay, do not think I flat
ter;
    For what advancement may I hope from thee,
    That no revenue hast but thy good spirits

    To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
    No, let the candied tongue lick
 absurd pomp,
    And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
    Where thrift may follow fawning. D
ost thou hear?
    Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
    And could of men distinguish,
 her election
    Hath seal'd thee for herself. For thou hast been
    As one, in suff'ring all, t
hat suffers nothing;
    A man that Fortune's buffets and rewards
    Hast ta'en with equal thanks
; and blest are those
    Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled
    That they are not a 
pipe for Fortune's finger
    To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
    That is not pass
ion's slave, and I will wear him
    In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
    As I do the
e. Something too much of this I
    There is a play to-night before the King.
    One scene of it 
comes near the circumstance,
    Which I have told thee, of my father's death.
    I prithee, when
 thou seest that act afoot,
    Even with the very comment of thy soul
    Observe my uncle. If hi
s occulted guilt
    Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
    It is a damned ghost that we have s
een,
    And my imaginations are as foul
    As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
    For I
 mine eyes will rivet to his face,
    And after we will both our judgments join
    In censure of
 his seeming.
  Hor. Well, my lord.
    If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
    An
d scape detecting, I will pay the theft.

    Sound a flourish. [Enter Trumpets and Kettledrums. D
anish
    march. [Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz,
      Guildenstern, and other
 Lords attendant, with the Guard
                       carrying torches.

  Ham. They are coming
 to the play. I must be idle.
    Get you a place.
  King. How fares our cousin Hamlet?
  Ham. Ex
cellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish. I eat the
air,
    promise-cramm'd. You cannot feed ca
pons so.
  King. I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet. These words are
not
    mine.
  Ham. N
o, nor mine now. [To Polonius] My lord, you play'd once
    i' th' university, you say?
  Pol. Tha
t did I, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.
  Ham. What did you enact?
  Pol. I did enact Ju
lius Caesar; I was kill'd i' th' Capitol;
Brutus
    kill'd me.
  Ham. It was a brute part of him
 to kill so capital a calf
there. Be
    the players ready.
  Ros. Ay, my lord. They stay upon yo
ur patience.
  Queen. Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
  Ham. No, good mother. Here's metal
 more attractive.
  Pol. [to the King] O, ho! do you mark that?
  Ham. Lady, shall I lie in your l
ap?
                                  [Sits down at Ophelia's feet.]

  Oph. No, my lord.
  Ham.
 I mean, my head upon your lap?
  Oph. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Do you think I meant country matters?

  Oph. I think nothing, my lord.
  Ham. That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
  Oph. W
hat is, my lord?
  Ham. Nothing.
  Oph. You are merry, my lord.
  Ham. Who, I?
  Oph. Ay, my lor
d.
  Ham. O God, your only jig-maker! What should a man do but be
merry?
    For look you how che
erfully my mother looks, and my father
died
    within 's two hours.
  Oph. Nay 'tis twice two mo
nths, my lord.
  Ham. So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I'll have
a
    suit of sa
bles. O heavens! die two months ago, and not
forgotten
    yet? Then there's hope a great man's me
mory may outlive his
life
    half a year. But, by'r Lady, he must build churches then; or
else

    shall he suffer not thinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose

    epitaph is 'For O, for O, th
e hobby-horse is forgot!'

               Hautboys play. The dumb show enters.

    Enter a King
 and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing
    him and he her. She kneels, and makes show of p
rotestation
    unto him. He takes her up, and declines his head upon her
    neck. He lays him do
wn upon a bank of flowers. She, seeing
    him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes of
f his
    crown, kisses it, pours poison in the sleeper's ears, and
    leaves him. The Queen retu
rns, finds the King dead, and makes
    passionate action. The Poisoner with some three or four
Mu
tes,
    comes in again, seem to condole with her. The dead body is
    carried away. The Poisoner
 wooes the Queen with gifts; she
    seems harsh and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts
    
his love.
                                                         Exeunt.

  Oph. What means thi
s, my lord?
  Ham. Marry, this is miching malhecho; it means mischief.
  Oph. Belike this show imp
orts the argument of the play.

                      Enter Prologue.

  Ham. We shall know by t
his fellow. The players cannot keep
counsel;
    they'll tell all.
  Oph. Will he tell us what th
is show meant?
  Ham. Ay, or any show that you'll show him. Be not you asham'd
to
    show, he'll
 not shame to tell you what it means.
  Oph. You are naught, you are naught! I'll mark the play.


    Pro. For us, and for our tragedy,
      Here stooping to your clemency,
      We beg your hea
ring patiently.                     [Exit.]

  Ham. Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
  
Oph. 'Tis brief, my lord.
  Ham. As woman's love.

              Enter [two Players as] King and 
Queen.

    King. Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round
      Neptune's salt wash and T
ellus' orbed ground,
      And thirty dozen moons with borrowed sheen
      About the world have t
imes twelve thirties been,
      Since love our hearts, and Hymen did our hands,
      Unite comut
ual in most sacred bands.
    Queen. So many journeys may the sun and moon
      Make us again cou
nt o'er ere love be done!
      But woe is me! you are so sick of late,
      So far from cheer an
d from your former state.
      That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
      Discomfort you,
 my lord, it nothing must;
      For women's fear and love holds quantity,
      In neither aught,
 or in extremity.
      Now what my love is, proof hath made you know;
      And as my love is siz
'd, my fear is so.
      Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
      Where little fea
rs grow great, great love grows there.
    King. Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;

      My operant powers their functions leave to do.
      And thou shalt live in this fair world b
ehind,
      Honour'd, belov'd, and haply one as kind
      For husband shalt thou-
    Queen. O,
 confound the rest!
      Such love must needs be treason in my breast.
      When second husband 
let me be accurst!
      None wed the second but who killed the first.

  Ham. [aside] Wormwood, 
wormwood!

    Queen. The instances that second marriage move
      Are base respects of thrift, 
but none of love.
      A second time I kill my husband dead
      When second husband kisses me i
n bed.
    King. I do believe you think what now you speak;
      But what we do determine oft we 
break.
      Purpose is but the slave to memory,
      Of violent birth, but poor validity;
     
 Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree,
      But fall unshaken when they mellow be.
  
    Most necessary 'tis that we forget
      To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt.
      Wha
t to ourselves in passion we propose,
      The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
      The v
iolence of either grief or joy
      Their own enactures with themselves destroy.
      Where joy 
most revels, grief doth most lament;
      Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
      Thi
s world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
      That even our loves should with our fortunes cha
nge;
      For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
      Whether love lead fortune, or else fort
une love.
      The great man down, you mark his favourite flies,
      The poor advanc'd makes fr
iends of enemies;
      And hitherto doth love on fortune tend,
      For who not needs shall neve
r lack a friend,
      And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
      Directly seasons him his en
emy.
      But, orderly to end where I begun,
      Our wills and fates do so contrary run
      
That our devices still are overthrown;
      Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own.
  
    So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
      But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dea
d.
    Queen. Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light,
      Sport and repose lock from me day
 and night,
      To desperation turn my trust and hope,
      An anchor's cheer in prison be my s
cope,
      Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
      Meet what I would have well, and it de
stroy,
      Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
      If, once a widow, ever I be wife!


  Ham. If she should break it now!

    King. 'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile.

      My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile
      The tedious day with sleep.
    Queen.
 Sleep rock thy brain,
                                                    [He] sleeps.
      And 
never come mischance between us twain!
Exit.

  Ham. Madam, how like you this play?
  Queen. The
 lady doth protest too much, methinks.
  Ham. O, but she'll keep her word.
  King. Have you heard 
the argument? Is there no offence in't?
  Ham. No, no! They do but jest, poison in jest; no offence
 i'
th'
    world.
  King. What do you call the play?
  Ham. 'The Mousetrap.' Marry, how? Tropic
ally. This play is the
    image of a murther done in Vienna. Gonzago is the duke's
name;
    his
 wife, Baptista. You shall see anon. 'Tis a knavish piece
of
    work; but what o' that? Your Maje
sty, and we that have free
    souls, it touches us not. Let the gall'd jade winch; our
withers
 
   are unwrung.

                         Enter Lucianus.

    This is one Lucianus, nephew to t
he King.
  Oph. You are as good as a chorus, my lord.
  Ham. I could interpret between you and you
r love, if I could
see
    the puppets dallying.
  Oph. You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
  H
am. It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
  Oph. Still better, and worse.
  Ham. So yo
u must take your husbands.- Begin, murtherer. Pox,
leave
    thy damnable faces, and begin! Come, 
the croaking raven doth
    bellow for revenge.

    Luc. Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, a
nd time agreeing;
      Confederate season, else no creature seeing;
      Thou mixture rank, of m
idnight weeds collected,
      With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,
      Thy natura
l magic and dire property
      On wholesome life usurp immediately.
                             
      Pours the poison in his ears.

  Ham. He poisons him i' th' garden for's estate. His name's

Gonzago.
    The story is extant, and written in very choice Italian. You
    shall see anon how 
the murtherer gets the love of Gonzago's
wife.
  Oph. The King rises.
  Ham. What, frighted with 
false fire?
  Queen. How fares my lord?
  Pol. Give o'er the play.
  King. Give me some light! Aw
ay!
  All. Lights, lights, lights!
                              Exeunt all but Hamlet and Horatio
.
  Ham.   Why, let the strucken deer go weep,
          The hart ungalled play;
         For som
e must watch, while some must sleep:
          Thus runs the world away.
    Would not this, sir, 
and a forest of feathers- if the rest of
my
    fortunes turn Turk with me-with two Provincial ros
es on my
raz'd
    shoes, get me a fellowship in a cry of players, sir?
  Hor. Half a share.
  H
am.   A whole one I!
         For thou dost know, O Damon dear,
           This realm dismantled w
as
         Of Jove himself; and now reigns here
           A very, very- pajock.
  Hor. You migh
t have rhym'd.
  Ham. O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand
    pound! Didst p
erceive?
  Hor. Very well, my lord.
  Ham. Upon the talk of the poisoning?
  Hor. I did very well
 note him.
  Ham.   Aha! Come, some music! Come, the recorders!
         For if the King like not 
the comedy,
         Why then, belike he likes it not, perdy.
    Come, some music!

           
     Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Guil. Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.
  H
am. Sir, a whole history.
  Guil. The King, sir-
  Ham. Ay, sir, what of him?
  Guil. Is in his r
etirement, marvellous distemper'd.
  Ham. With drink, sir?
  Guil. No, my lord; rather with choler
.
  Ham. Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this
to
    the doctor; for me to 
put him to his purgation would perhaps
    plunge him into far more choler.
  Guil. Good my lord, 
put your discourse into some frame, and
start
    not so wildly from my affair.
  Ham. I am tame,
 sir; pronounce.
  Guil. The Queen, your mother, in most great affliction of
spirit
    hath sent
 me to you.
  Ham. You are welcome.
  Guil. Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right

breed.
    If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, I will
do
    your mother's comm
andment; if not, your pardon and my return
    shall be the end of my business.
  Ham. Sir, I cann
ot.
  Guil. What, my lord?
  Ham. Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseas'd. But, sir,
such

    answer as I can make, you shall command; or rather, as you
say,
    my mother. Therefore no m
ore, but to the matter! My mother,
you
    say-
  Ros. Then thus she says: your behaviour hath st
ruck her into
    amazement and admiration.
  Ham. O wonderful son, that can so stonish a mother! 
But is
there no
    sequel at the heels of this mother's admiration? Impart.
  Ros. She desires t
o speak with you in her closet ere you go to
bed.
  Ham. We shall obey, were she ten times our mot
her. Have you any
    further trade with us?
  Ros. My lord, you once did love me.
  Ham. And do 
still, by these pickers and stealers!
  Ros. Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? You do

surely
    bar the door upon your own liberty, if you deny your griefs
to
    your friend.
  Ha
m. Sir, I lack advancement.
  Ros. How can that be, when you have the voice of the King
himself
 
   for your succession in Denmark?
  Ham. Ay, sir, but 'while the grass grows'- the proverb is
som
ething
    musty.

                     Enter the Players with recorders.

    O, the recorders
! Let me see one. To withdraw with you- why
do
    you go about to recover the wind of me, as if y
ou would drive
me
    into a toil?
  Guil. O my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too
unm
annerly.
  Ham. I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this
pipe?
  Guil. My lord, I c
annot.
  Ham. I pray you.
  Guil. Believe me, I cannot.
  Ham. I do beseech you.
  Guil. I know,
 no touch of it, my lord.
  Ham. It is as easy as lying. Govern these ventages with your
    finge
rs and thumbs, give it breath with your mouth, and it
will
    discourse most eloquent music. Look
 you, these are the stops.
  Guil. But these cannot I command to any utt'rance of harmony. I
    h
ave not the skill.
  Ham. Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me!
You
    would p
lay upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you
would
    pluck out the heart of my mystery; you
 would sound me from my
    lowest note to the top of my compass; and there is much
music,
    ex
cellent voice, in this little organ, yet cannot you make it
    speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am e
asier to be play'd on than
a
    pipe? Call me what instrument you will, though you can fret
me,

    you cannot play upon me.

                        Enter Polonius.

    God bless you, sir!

  Pol. My lord, the Queen would speak with you, and presently.
  Ham. Do you see yonder cloud that
's almost in shape of a camel?
  Pol. By th' mass, and 'tis like a camel indeed.
  Ham. Methinks i
t is like a weasel.
  Pol. It is back'd like a weasel.
  Ham. Or like a whale.
  Pol. Very like a
 whale.
  Ham. Then will I come to my mother by-and-by.- They fool me to
the
    top of my bent.-
 I will come by-and-by.
  Pol. I will say so.                                      Exit.
  Ham. 'B
y-and-by' is easily said.- Leave me, friends.
                                        [Exeunt all b
ut Hamlet.]

    'Tis now the very witching time of night,
    When churchyards yawn, and hell it
self breathes out
    Contagion to this world. Now could I drink hot blood
    And do such bitter 
business as the day
    Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother!
    O heart, lose not thy 
nature; let not ever
    The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom.
    Let me be cruel, not unnatura
l;
    I will speak daggers to her, but use none.
    My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites-
 
   How in my words somever she be shent,
    To give them seals never, my soul, consent!           
  Exit.




Scene III.
A room in the Castle.

Enter King, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.


  King. I like him not, nor stands it safe with us
    To let his madness range. Therefore prepare 
you;
    I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
    And he to England shall along with you.
 
   The terms of our estate may not endure
    Hazard so near us as doth hourly grow
    Out of his
 lunacies.
  Guil. We will ourselves provide.
    Most holy and religious fear it is
    To keep 
those many many bodies safe
    That live and feed upon your Majesty.
  Ros. The single and peculi
ar life is bound
    With all the strength and armour of the mind
    To keep itself from noyance;
 but much more
    That spirit upon whose weal depends and rests
    The lives of many. The cesse 
of majesty
    Dies not alone, but like a gulf doth draw
    What's near it with it. It is a massy
 wheel,
    Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,
    To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser
 things
    Are mortis'd and adjoin'd; which when it falls,
    Each small annexment, petty conseq
uence,
    Attends the boist'rous ruin. Never alone
    Did the king sigh, but with a general groa
n.
  King. Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;
    For we will fetters put upon this fear,

    Which now goes too free-footed.
  Both. We will haste us.
                                  
             Exeunt Gentlemen.

                   Enter Polonius.

  Pol. My lord, he's going t
o his mother's closet.
    Behind the arras I'll convey myself
    To hear the process. I'll warra
nt she'll tax him home;
    And, as you said, and wisely was it said,
    'Tis meet that some more
 audience than a mother,
    Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear
    The speech, of v
antage. Fare you well, my liege.
    I'll call upon you ere you go to bed
    And tell you what I 
know.
  King. Thanks, dear my lord.
                                                Exit [Polonius
].
    O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven;
    It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,
  
  A brother's murther! Pray can I not,
    Though inclination be as sharp as will.
    My stronger
 guilt defeats my strong intent,
    And, like a man to double business bound,
    I stand in paus
e where I shall first begin,
    And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
    Were thicker than 
itself with brother's blood,
    Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
    To wash it whit
e as snow? Whereto serves mercy
    But to confront the visage of offence?
    And what's in praye
r but this twofold force,
    To be forestalled ere we come to fall,
    Or pardon'd being down? T
hen I'll look up;
    My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer
    Can serve my turn? 'Forgiv
e me my foul murther'?
    That cannot be; since I am still possess'd
    Of those effects for whi
ch I did the murther-
    My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.
    May one be pardon'd and r
etain th' offence?
    In the corrupted currents of this world
    Offence's gilded hand may shove
 by justice,
    And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
    Buys out the law; but 'tis not so a
bove.
    There is no shuffling; there the action lies
    In his true nature, and we ourselves co
mpell'd,
    Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
    To give in evidence. What then? Wha
t rests?
    Try what repentance can. What can it not?
    Yet what can it when one cannot repent?

    O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
    O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
   
 Art more engag'd! Help, angels! Make assay.
    Bow, stubborn knees; and heart with strings of ste
el,
    Be soft as sinews of the new-born babe!
    All may be well.                              
    He kneels.

                         Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Now might I do it pat, now he is 
praying;
    And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven,
    And so am I reveng'd. That would be 
scann'd.
    A villain kills my father; and for that,
    I, his sole son, do this same villain se
nd
    To heaven.
    Why, this is hire and salary, not revenge!
    He took my father grossly, f
ull of bread,
    With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
    And how his audit stands, 
who knows save heaven?
    But in our circumstance and course of thought,
    'Tis heavy with him;
 and am I then reveng'd,
    To take him in the purging of his soul,
    When he is fit and season
ed for his passage?
    No.
    Up, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent.
    When he is drunk
 asleep; or in his rage;
    Or in th' incestuous pleasure of his bed;
    At gaming, swearing, or
 about some act
    That has no relish of salvation in't-
    Then trip him, that his heels may ki
ck at heaven,
    And that his soul may be as damn'd and black
    As hell, whereto it goes. My mo
ther stays.
    This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.              Exit.
  King. [rises] My wo
rds fly up, my thoughts remain below.
    Words without thoughts never to heaven go.             Ex
it.




Scene IV.
The Queen's closet.

Enter Queen and Polonius.

  Pol. He will come stra
ight. Look you lay home to him.
    Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,
    And 
that your Grace hath screen'd and stood between
    Much heat and him. I'll silence me even here.

    Pray you be round with him.
  Ham. (within) Mother, mother, mother!
  Queen. I'll warrant you;
 fear me not. Withdraw; I hear him
coming.
                              [Polonius hides behind th
e arras.]

                          Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Now, mother, what's the matter?
  Qu
een. Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
  Ham. Mother, you have my father much offended.

  Queen. Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
  Ham. Go, go, you question with a wicked tong
ue.
  Queen. Why, how now, Hamlet?
  Ham. What's the matter now?
  Queen. Have you forgot me?
  
Ham. No, by the rood, not so!
    You are the Queen, your husband's brother's wife,
    And (would
 it were not so!) you are my mother.
  Queen. Nay, then I'll set those to you that can speak.
  Ha
m. Come, come, and sit you down. You shall not budge;
    You go not till I set you up a glass
   
 Where you may see the inmost part of you.
  Queen. What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murther me?
 
   Help, help, ho!
  Pol. [behind] What, ho! help, help, help!
  Ham. [draws] How now? a rat? Dead
 for a ducat, dead!
            [Makes a pass through the arras and] kills Polonius.
  Pol. [behin
d] O, I am slain!
  Queen. O me, what hast thou done?
  Ham. Nay, I know not. Is it the King?
  Q
ueen. O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
  Ham. A bloody deed- almost as bad, good mother,
  
  As kill a king, and marry with his brother.
  Queen. As kill a king?
  Ham. Ay, lady, it was my 
word.
                         [Lifts up the arras and sees Polonius.]
    Thou wretched, rash, in
truding fool, farewell!
    I took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune.
    Thou find'st to be t
oo busy is some danger.
    Leave wringing of your hands. Peace! sit you down
    And let me wring
 your heart; for so I shall
    If it be made of penetrable stuff;
    If damned custom have not b
raz'd it so
    That it is proof and bulwark against sense.
  Queen. What have I done that thou da
r'st wag thy tongue
    In noise so rude against me?
  Ham. Such an act
    That blurs the grace 
and blush of modesty;
    Calls virtue hypocrite; takes off the rose
    From the fair forehead of
 an innocent love,
    And sets a blister there; makes marriage vows
    As false as dicers' oaths
. O, such a deed
    As from the body of contraction plucks
    The very soul, and sweet religion 
makes
    A rhapsody of words! Heaven's face doth glow;
    Yea, this solidity and compound mass,

    With tristful visage, as against the doom,
    Is thought-sick at the act.
  Queen. Ah me, wh
at act,
    That roars so loud and thunders in the index?
  Ham. Look here upon th's picture, and 
on this,
    The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
    See what a grace was seated on this 
brow;
    Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
    An eye like Mars, to threaten and comma
nd;
    A station like the herald Mercury
    New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill:
    A combina
tion and a form indeed
    Where every god did seem to set his seal
    To give the world assuranc
e of a man.
    This was your husband. Look you now what follows.
    Here is your husband, like a
 mildew'd ear
    Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
    Could you on this fair mounta
in leave to feed,
    And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes
    You cannot call it love; for 
at your age
    The heyday in the blood is tame, it's humble,
    And waits upon the judgment; and
 what judgment
    Would step from this to this? Sense sure you have,
    Else could you not have 
motion; but sure that sense
    Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,
    Nor sense to ecstacy 
was ne'er so thrall'd
    But it reserv'd some quantity of choice
    To serve in such a differenc
e. What devil was't
    That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
    Eyes without feeling, fee
ling without sight,
    Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
    Or but a sickly part of
 one true sense
    Could not so mope.
    O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
    If t
hou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
    To flaming youth let virtue be as wax
    And melt in he
r own fire. Proclaim no shame
    When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
    Since frost its
elf as actively doth burn,
    And reason panders will.
  Queen. O Hamlet, speak no more!
    Tho
u turn'st mine eyes into my very soul,
    And there I see such black and grained spots
    As wil
l not leave their tinct.
  Ham. Nay, but to live
    In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
    St
ew'd in corruption, honeying and making love
    Over the nasty sty!
  Queen. O, speak to me no mo
re!
    These words like daggers enter in mine ears.
    No more, sweet Hamlet!
  Ham. A murthere
r and a villain!
    A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
    Of your precedent lord; a vi
ce of kings;
    A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
    That from a shelf the precious diadem 
stole
    And put it in his pocket!
  Queen. No more!

                Enter the Ghost in his ni
ghtgown.

  Ham. A king of shreds and patches!-
    Save me and hover o'er me with your wings,
 
   You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?
  Queen. Alas, he's mad!
  Ham. Do you no
t come your tardy son to chide,
    That, laps'd in time and passion, lets go by
    Th' important
 acting of your dread command?
    O, say!
  Ghost. Do not forget. This visitation
    Is but to 
whet thy almost blunted purpose.
    But look, amazement on thy mother sits.
    O, step between h
er and her fighting soul
    Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works.
    Speak to her, Hamlet.

  Ham. How is it with you, lady?
  Queen. Alas, how is't with you,
    That you do bend your eye 
on vacancy,
    And with th' encorporal air do hold discourse?
    Forth at your eyes your spirits
 wildly peep;
    And, as the sleeping soldiers in th' alarm,
    Your bedded hairs, like life in 
excrements,
    Start up and stand an end. O gentle son,
    Upon the heat and flame of thy distem
per
    Sprinkle cool patience! Whereon do you look?
  Ham. On him, on him! Look you how pale he g
lares!
    His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
    Would make them capable.- Do not
 look upon me,
    Lest with this piteous action you convert
    My stern effects. Then what I hav
e to do
    Will want true colour- tears perchance for blood.
  Queen. To whom do you speak this?

  Ham. Do you see nothing there?
  Queen. Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
  Ham. Nor did y
ou nothing hear?
  Queen. No, nothing but ourselves.
  Ham. Why, look you there! Look how it steal
s away!
    My father, in his habit as he liv'd!
    Look where he goes even now out at the portal
!
                                                     Exit Ghost.
  Queen. This is the very coina
ge of your brain.
    This bodiless creation ecstasy
    Is very cunning in.
  Ham. Ecstasy?
   
 My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time
    And makes as healthful music. It is not madness

    That I have utt'red. Bring me to the test,
    And I the matter will reword; which madness
   
 Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
    Lay not that flattering unction to your soul
  
  That not your trespass but my madness speaks.
    It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,

    Whiles rank corruption, mining all within,
    Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
   
 Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
    And do not spread the compost on the weeds
    To 
make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;
    For in the fatness of these pursy times
    Virtu
e itself of vice must pardon beg-
    Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.
  Queen. O Hamle
t, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
  Ham. O, throw away the worser part of it,
    And live the
 purer with the other half,
    Good night- but go not to my uncle's bed.
    Assume a virtue, if 
you have it not.
    That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat
    Of habits evil, is angel yet
 in this,
    That to the use of actions fair and good
    He likewise gives a frock or livery,
 
   That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,
    And that shall lend a kind of easiness
    To the n
ext abstinence; the next more easy;
    For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
    And eit
her [master] the devil, or throw him out
    With wondrous potency. Once more, good night;
    And
 when you are desirous to be blest,
    I'll blessing beg of you.- For this same lord,
    I do re
pent; but heaven hath pleas'd it so,
    To punish me with this, and this with me,
    That I must
 be their scourge and minister.
    I will bestow him, and will answer well
    The death I gave h
im. So again, good night.
    I must be cruel, only to be kind;
    Thus bad begins, and worse rem
ains behind.
    One word more, good lady.
  Queen. What shall I do?
  Ham. Not this, by no means
, that I bid you do:
    Let the bloat King tempt you again to bed;
    Pinch wanton on your cheek
; call you his mouse;
    And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
    Or paddling in your neck w
ith his damn'd fingers,
    Make you to ravel all this matter out,
    That I essentially am not i
n madness,
    But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;
    For who that's but a queen, fai
r, sober, wise,
    Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib
    Such dear concernings hide? Who wo
uld do so?
    No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
    Unpeg the basket on the house's top,
    
Let the birds fly, and like the famous ape,
    To try conclusions, in the basket creep
    And br
eak your own neck down.
  Queen. Be thou assur'd, if words be made of breath,
    And breath of li
fe, I have no life to breathe
    What thou hast said to me.
  Ham. I must to England; you know th
at?
  Queen. Alack,
    I had forgot! 'Tis so concluded on.
  Ham. There's letters seal'd; and my
 two schoolfellows,
    Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,
    They bear the mandate; they
 must sweep my way
    And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
    For 'tis the sport to have the 
enginer
    Hoist with his own petar; and 't shall go hard
    But I will delve one yard below the
ir mines
    And blow them at the moon. O, 'tis most sweet
    When in one line two crafts directl
y meet.
    This man shall set me packing.
    I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.-
    Mo
ther, good night.- Indeed, this counsellor
    Is now most still, most secret, and most grave,
   
 Who was in life a foolish peating knave.
    Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.
    Good 
night, mother.
                  [Exit the Queen. Then] Exit Hamlet, tugging in
                  
                                     Polonius.

ACT IV. Scene I.
Elsinore. A ro
om in the Castle.

Enter King and Queen, with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  King. There's mat
ter in these sighs. These profound heaves
    You must translate; 'tis fit we understand them.
   
 Where is your son?
  Queen. Bestow this place on us a little while.
                          [Ex
eunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
    Ah, mine own lord, what have I seen to-night!
  King. What
, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
  Queen. Mad as the sea and wind when both contend
    Which is the m
ightier. In his lawless fit
    Behind the arras hearing something stir,
    Whips out his rapier,
 cries 'A rat, a rat!'
    And in this brainish apprehension kills
    The unseen good old man.
 
 King. O heavy deed!
    It had been so with us, had we been there.
    His liberty is full of thr
eats to all-
    To you yourself, to us, to every one.
    Alas, how shall this bloody deed be ans
wer'd?
    It will be laid to us, whose providence
    Should have kept short, restrain'd, and out
 of haunt
    This mad young man. But so much was our love
    We would not understand what was mo
st fit,
    But, like the owner of a foul disease,
    To keep it from divulging, let it feed
   
 Even on the pith of life. Where is he gone?
  Queen. To draw apart the body he hath kill'd;
    O
'er whom his very madness, like some ore
    Among a mineral of metals base,
    Shows itself pure
. He weeps for what is done.
  King. O Gertrude, come away!
    The sun no sooner shall the mounta
ins touch
    But we will ship him hence; and this vile deed
    We must with all our majesty and 
skill
    Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!

             Enter Rosencrantz and Guil
denstern.

    Friends both, go join you with some further aid.
    Hamlet in madness hath Poloni
us slain,
    And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him.
    Go seek him out; speak fair, a
nd bring the body
    Into the chapel. I pray you haste in this.
                          Exeunt 
[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern].
    Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends
    And let t
hem know both what we mean to do
    And what's untimely done. [So haply slander-]
    Whose whisp
er o'er the world's diameter,
    As level as the cannon to his blank,
    Transports his poisoned
 shot- may miss our name
    And hit the woundless air.- O, come away!
    My soul is full of disc
ord and dismay.
                                                         Exeunt.




Scene II.

Elsinore. A passage in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Safely stow'd.
  Gentlemen. (within
) Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!
  Ham. But soft! What noise? Who calls on Hamlet? O, here they
come.

   
            Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Ros. What have you done, my lord, with the dead
 body?
  Ham. Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
  Ros. Tell us where 'tis, that we may ta
ke it thence
    And bear it to the chapel.
  Ham. Do not believe it.
  Ros. Believe what?
  Ham
. That I can keep your counsel, and not mine own. Besides,
to be
    demanded of a sponge, what re
plication should be made by the
son
    of a king?
  Ros. Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
  H
am. Ay, sir; that soaks up the King's countenance, his
rewards,
    his authorities. But such offi
cers do the King best service
in
    the end. He keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his
ja
w;
    first mouth'd, to be last swallowed. When he needs what you
have
    glean'd, it is but sq
ueezing you and, sponge, you shall be
dry
    again.
  Ros. I understand you not, my lord.
  Ham
. I am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.
  Ros. My lord, you must tell us where
 the body is and go with us
to
    the King.
  Ham. The body is with the King, but the King is no
t with the
body.
    The King is a thing-
  Guil. A thing, my lord?
  Ham. Of nothing. Bring me 
to him. Hide fox, and all after.
                                                         Exeunt.





Scene III.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King.

  King. I have sent to seek hi
m and to find the body.
    How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
    Yet must not we put 
the strong law on him.
    He's lov'd of the distracted multitude,
    Who like not in their judgm
ent, but their eyes;
    And where 'tis so, th' offender's scourge is weigh'd,
    But never the o
ffence. To bear all smooth and even,
    This sudden sending him away must seem
    Deliberate pau
se. Diseases desperate grown
    By desperate appliance are reliev'd,
    Or not at all.

      
              Enter Rosencrantz.

    How now O What hath befall'n?
  Ros. Where the dead body is
 bestow'd, my lord,
    We cannot get from him.
  King. But where is he?
  Ros. Without, my lord;
 guarded, to know your pleasure.
  King. Bring him before us.
  Ros. Ho, Guildenstern! Bring in my
 lord.

        Enter Hamlet and Guildenstern [with Attendants].

  King. Now, Hamlet, where's P
olonius?
  Ham. At supper.
  King. At supper? Where?
  Ham. Not where he eats, but where he is ea
ten. A certain
    convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your worm is
your
    only emper
or for diet. We fat all creatures else to fat us,
and
    we fat ourselves for maggots. Your fat k
ing and your lean
beggar
    is but variable service- two dishes, but to one table. That's
the
 
   end.
  King. Alas, alas!
  Ham. A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and
eat

    of the fish that hath fed of that worm.
  King. What dost thou mean by this?
  Ham. Nothing b
ut to show you how a king may go a progress
through
    the guts of a beggar.
  King. Where is Po
lonius?
  Ham. In heaven. Send thither to see. If your messenger find him
not
    there, seek him
 i' th' other place yourself. But indeed, if
you
    find him not within this month, you shall nos
e him as you go
up
    the stair, into the lobby.
  King. Go seek him there. [To Attendants.]
  
Ham. He will stay till you come.
                                            [Exeunt Attendants.]

  King. Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,-
    Which we do tender as we dearly grieve

    For that which thou hast done,- must send thee hence
    With fiery quickness. Therefore prepar
e thyself.
    The bark is ready and the wind at help,
    Th' associates tend, and everything is 
bent
    For England.
  Ham. For England?
  King. Ay, Hamlet.
  Ham. Good.
  King. So is it, if
 thou knew'st our purposes.
  Ham. I see a cherub that sees them. But come, for England!
    Farew
ell, dear mother.
  King. Thy loving father, Hamlet.
  Ham. My mother! Father and mother is man an
d wife; man and wife
is
    one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England!
Exit.
  King. Follo
w him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard.
    Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night.
    Aw
ay! for everything is seal'd and done
    That else leans on th' affair. Pray you make haste.
    
                        Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]
    And, England, if my love thou hold
'st at aught,-
    As my great power thereof may give thee sense,
    Since yet thy cicatrice look
s raw and red
    After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
    Pays homage to us,- thou mayst not 
coldly set
    Our sovereign process, which imports at full,
    By letters congruing to that effe
ct,
    The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;
    For like the hectic in my blood he rages,

    And thou must cure me. Till I know 'tis done,
    Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun. 
            Exit.

Scene IV.
Near Elsinore.

Enter Fortinbras with his Army o
ver the stage.

  For. Go, Captain, from me greet the Danish king.
    Tell him that by his licen
se Fortinbras
    Craves the conveyance of a promis'd march
    Over his kingdom. You know the ren
dezvous.
    If that his Majesty would aught with us,
    We shall express our duty in his eye;
 
   And let him know so.
  Capt. I will do't, my lord.
  For. Go softly on.
                      
             Exeunt [all but the Captain].

       Enter Hamlet, Rosencrantz, [Guildenstern,] and 
others.

  Ham. Good sir, whose powers are these?
  Capt. They are of Norway, sir.
  Ham. How pu
rpos'd, sir, I pray you?
  Capt. Against some part of Poland.
  Ham. Who commands them, sir?
  Ca
pt. The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.
  Ham. Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
    Or f
or some frontier?
  Capt. Truly to speak, and with no addition,
    We go to gain a little patch o
f ground
    That hath in it no profit but the name.
    To pay five ducats, five, I would not far
m it;
    Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
    A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
  
Ham. Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
  Capt. Yes, it is already garrison'd.
  Ham. Two 
thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
    Will not debate the question of this straw.
    This
 is th' imposthume of much wealth and peace,
    That inward breaks, and shows no cause without
  
  Why the man dies.- I humbly thank you, sir.
  Capt. God b' wi' you, sir.                         
    [Exit.]
  Ros. Will't please you go, my lord?
  Ham. I'll be with you straight. Go a little be
fore.
                                        [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]
    How all occasions do in
form against me
    And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
    If his chief good and market of h
is time
    Be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.
    Sure he that made us with such large d
iscourse,
    Looking before and after, gave us not
    That capability and godlike reason
    To
 fust in us unus'd. Now, whether it be
    Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple
    Of thinkin
g too precisely on th' event,-
    A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
    And ev
er three parts coward,- I do not know
    Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do,'
    Sith I h
ave cause, and will, and strength, and means
    To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me.
    W
itness this army of such mass and charge,
    Led by a delicate and tender prince,
    Whose spiri
t, with divine ambition puff'd,
    Makes mouths at the invisible event,
    Exposing what is mort
al and unsure
    To all that fortune, death, and danger dare,
    Even for an eggshell. Rightly t
o be great
    Is not to stir without great argument,
    But greatly to find quarrel in a straw

    When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,
    That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,

    Excitements of my reason and my blood,
    And let all sleep, while to my shame I see
    The
 imminent death of twenty thousand men
    That for a fantasy and trick of fame
    Go to their gr
aves like beds, fight for a plot
    Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
    Which is not to
mb enough and continent
    To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,
    My thoughts be bloody,
 or be nothing worth!            Exit.

Scene V.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle
.

Enter Horatio, Queen, and a Gentleman.

  Queen. I will not speak with her.
  Gent. She is i
mportunate, indeed distract.
    Her mood will needs be pitied.
  Queen. What would she have?
  G
ent. She speaks much of her father; says she hears
    There's tricks i' th' world, and hems, and b
eats her heart;
    Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,
    That carry but half se
nse. Her speech is nothing,
    Yet the unshaped use of it doth move
    The hearers to collection
; they aim at it,
    And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;
    Which, as her winks an
d nods and gestures yield them,
    Indeed would make one think there might be thought,
    Though
 nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
  Hor. 'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew
    
Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.
  Queen. Let her come in.
                           
                    [Exit Gentleman.]
    [Aside] To my sick soul (as sin's true nature is)
    Ea
ch toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
    So full of artless jealousy is guilt
    It spills 
itself in fearing to be spilt.

                 Enter Ophelia distracted.

  Oph. Where is the 
beauteous Majesty of Denmark?
  Queen. How now, Ophelia?
  Oph. (sings)
         How should I you
r true-love know
           From another one?
         By his cockle bat and' staff
           An
d his sandal shoon.

  Queen. Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
  Oph. Say you? Nay, pray
 You mark.

    (Sings) He is dead and gone, lady,
              He is dead and gone;
          
  At his head a grass-green turf,
              At his heels a stone.

    O, ho!
  Queen. Nay, 
but Ophelia-
  Oph. Pray you mark.

    (Sings) White his shroud as the mountain snow-

       
             Enter King.

  Queen. Alas, look here, my lord!
  Oph. (Sings)
           Larded al
l with sweet flowers;
         Which bewept to the grave did not go
           With true-love show
ers.

  King. How do you, pretty lady?
  Oph. Well, God dild you! They say the owl was a baker's

daughter.
    Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be. God
be at
    your table!

  King. Conceit upon her father.
  Oph. Pray let's have no words of this; but when they ask, you

what
    it means, say you this:

    (Sings) To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,
              
All in the morning bedtime,
            And I a maid at your window,
              To be your Vale
ntine.

            Then up he rose and donn'd his clo'es
              And dupp'd the chamber do
or,
            Let in the maid, that out a maid
              Never departed more.

  King. Pre
tty Ophelia!
  Oph. Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't!

    [Sings] By Gis and b
y Saint Charity,
              Alack, and fie for shame!
            Young men will do't if they c
ome to't
              By Cock, they are to blame.

            Quoth she, 'Before you tumbled me
,
              You promis'd me to wed.'

    He answers:

            'So would I 'a' done, by
 yonder sun,
              An thou hadst not come to my bed.'

  King. How long hath she been thu
s?
  Oph. I hope all will be well. We must be patient; but I cannot
    choose but weep to think t
hey would lay him i' th' cold
ground.
    My brother shall know of it; and so I thank you for your
 good
    counsel. Come, my coach! Good night, ladies. Good night,
sweet
    ladies. Good night, 
good night.                         Exit
  King. Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.

                                                 [Exit Horatio.]

    O, this is the poison of d
eep grief; it springs
    All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
    When sorrows come
, they come not single spies.
    But in battalions! First, her father slain;
    Next, your son g
one, and he most violent author
    Of his own just remove; the people muddied,
    Thick and and 
unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers
    For good Polonius' death, and we have done but green
ly
    In hugger-mugger to inter him; poor Ophelia
    Divided from herself and her fair judgment,

    Without the which we are pictures or mere beasts;
    Last, and as much containing as all the
se,
    Her brother is in secret come from France;
    And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
  
  Feeds on his wonder, keep, himself in clouds,
    With pestilent speeches of his father's death,

    Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
    Will nothing stick our person to arraign
    In ea
r and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
    Like to a murd'ring piece, in many places
    Give me sup
erfluous death.                  A noise within.
  Queen. Alack, what noise is this?
  King. Where
 are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.

                     Enter a Messenger.

    What is
 the matter?
  Mess. Save Yourself, my lord:
    The ocean, overpeering of his list,
    Eats not
 the flats with more impetuous haste
    Than Young Laertes, in a riotous head,
    O'erbears Your
 offices. The rabble call him lord;
    And, as the world were now but to begin,
    Antiquity for
got, custom not known,
    The ratifiers and props of every word,
    They cry 'Choose we! Laertes
 shall be king!'
    Caps, hands, and tongues applaud it to the clouds,
    'Laertes shall be king
! Laertes king!'
                                                 A noise within.
  Queen. How che
erfully on the false trail they cry!
    O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!
  King. The do
ors are broke.

                    Enter Laertes with others.

  Laer. Where is this king?- Sir
s, staid you all without.
  All. No, let's come in!
  Laer. I pray you give me leave.
  All. We w
ill, we will!
  Laer. I thank you. Keep the door.      [Exeunt his Followers.]
    O thou vile kin
g,
    Give me my father!
  Queen. Calmly, good Laertes.
  Laer. That drop of blood that's calm p
roclaims me bastard;
    Cries cuckold to my father; brands the harlot
    Even here between the c
haste unsmirched brows
    Of my true mother.
  King. What is the cause, Laertes,
    That thy re
bellion looks so giantlike?
    Let him go, Gertrude. Do not fear our person.
    There's such div
inity doth hedge a king
    That treason can but peep to what it would,
    Acts little of his wil
l. Tell me, Laertes,
    Why thou art thus incens'd. Let him go, Gertrude.
    Speak, man.
  Laer
. Where is my father?
  King. Dead.
  Queen. But not by him!
  King. Let him demand his fill.
  
Laer. How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
    To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest de
vil
    Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
    I dare damnation. To this point I stand,

    That both the world, I give to negligence,
    Let come what comes; only I'll be reveng'd
  
  Most throughly for my father.
  King. Who shall stay you?
  Laer. My will, not all the world!
 
   And for my means, I'll husband them so well
    They shall go far with little.
  King. Good Lae
rtes,
    If you desire to know the certainty
    Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your r
evenge
    That sweepstake you will draw both friend and foe,
    Winner and loser?
  Laer. None 
but his enemies.
  King. Will you know them then?
  Laer. To his good friends thus wide I'll ope m
y arms
    And, like the kind life-rend'ring pelican,
    Repast them with my blood.
  King. Why,
 now You speak
    Like a good child and a true gentleman.
    That I am guiltless of your father'
s death,
    And am most sensibly in grief for it,
    It shall as level to your judgment pierce

    As day does to your eye.
                              A noise within: 'Let her come in.'
  La
er. How now? What noise is that?

                      Enter Ophelia.

    O heat, dry up my br
ains! Tears seven times salt
    Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!
    By heaven, thy mad
ness shall be paid by weight
    Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!
    Dear maid, kind 
sister, sweet Ophelia!
    O heavens! is't possible a young maid's wits
    Should be as mortal as
 an old man's life?
    Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,
    It sends some precious in
stance of itself
    After the thing it loves.

  Oph. (sings)
         They bore him barefac'd 
on the bier
           (Hey non nony, nony, hey nony)
         And in his grave rain'd many a tear
.

    Fare you well, my dove!
  Laer. Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
    It c
ould not move thus.
  Oph. You must sing 'A-down a-down, and you call him a-down-a.'
O,
    how t
he wheel becomes it! It is the false steward, that stole
his
    master's daughter.
  Laer. This 
nothing's more than matter.
  Oph. There's rosemary, that's for remembrance. Pray you, love,
    r
emember. And there is pansies, that's for thoughts.
  Laer. A document in madness! Thoughts and rem
embrance fitted.
  Oph. There's fennel for you, and columbines. There's rue for
you,
    and here
's some for me. We may call it herb of grace o'
Sundays.
    O, you must wear your rue with a diff
erence! There's a daisy.
I
    would give you some violets, but they wither'd all when my
father

    died. They say he made a good end.

    [Sings] For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.

  Lae
r. Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,
    She turns to favour and to prettiness.
  Oph.
 (sings)
         And will he not come again?
         And will he not come again?
           No,
 no, he is dead;
           Go to thy deathbed;
         He never will come again.

         His
 beard was as white as snow,
         All flaxen was his poll.
           He is gone, he is gone,

           And we cast away moan.
         God 'a'mercy on his soul!

    And of all Christian s
ouls, I pray God. God b' wi' you.
Exit.
  Laer. Do you see this, O God?
  King. Laertes, I must c
ommune with your grief,
    Or you deny me right. Go but apart,
    Make choice of whom your wises
t friends you will,
    And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me.
    If by direct or by co
llateral hand
    They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,
    Our crown, our life, and all
 that we call ours,
    To you in satisfaction; but if not,
    Be you content to lend your patien
ce to us,
    And we shall jointly labour with your soul
    To give it due content.
  Laer. Let 
this be so.
    His means of death, his obscure funeral-
    No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er 
his bones,
    No noble rite nor formal ostentation,-
    Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven t
o earth,
    That I must call't in question.
  King. So you shall;
    And where th' offence is l
et the great axe fall.
    I pray you go with me.
                                                
          Exeunt

Scene VI.
Elsinore. Another room in the Castle.

Enter Hora
tio with an Attendant.

  Hor. What are they that would speak with me?
  Servant. Seafaring men, 
sir. They say they have letters for
you.
  Hor. Let them come in.
                               
                [Exit Attendant.]
    I do not know from what part of the world
    I should be gr
eeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.

                          Enter Sailors.

  Sailor. God bless y
ou, sir.
  Hor. Let him bless thee too.
  Sailor. 'A shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter
 for
you,
    sir,- it comes from th' ambassador that was bound for
England- if
    your name be
 Horatio, as I am let to know it is.
  Hor. (reads the letter) 'Horatio, when thou shalt have
over
look'd
    this, give these fellows some means to the King. They have
    letters for him. Ere we 
were two days old at sea, a pirate of

    very warlike appointment gave us chase. Finding ourselv
es too
    slow of sail, we put on a compelled valour, and in the
grapple I
    boarded them. On 
the instant they got clear of our ship; so I
    alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with 
me like
thieves
    of mercy; but they knew what they did: I am to do a good turn
for
    them. 
Let the King have the letters I have sent, and repair
thou
    to me with as much speed as thou wo
uldst fly death. I have
words
    to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb; yet are they much
to
o
    light for the bore of the matter. These good fellows will
bring
    thee where I am. Rosenc
rantz and Guildenstern hold their
course
    for England. Of them I have much to tell thee. Farewe

                            'He that thou knowest thine, HAMLET.'

    Come, I will give you 
way for these your letters,
    And do't the speedier that you may direct me
    To him from whom 
you brought them.                   Exeunt.

Scene VII.
Elsinore. Another room 
in the Castle.

Enter King and Laertes.

  King. Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,

    And You must put me in your heart for friend,
    Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,

    That he which hath your noble father slain
    Pursued my life.
  Laer. It well appears. But 
tell me
    Why you proceeded not against these feats
    So crimeful and so capital in nature,
 
   As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
    You mainly were stirr'd up.
  King. O, for two 
special reasons,
    Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,
    But yet to me they are st
rong. The Queen his mother
    Lives almost by his looks; and for myself,-
    My virtue or my pla
gue, be it either which,-
    She's so conjunctive to my life and soul
    That, as the star moves
 not but in his sphere,
    I could not but by her. The other motive
    Why to a public count I m
ight not go
    Is the great love the general gender bear him,
    Who, dipping all his faults in 
their affection,
    Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
    Convert his gives to g
races; so that my arrows,
    Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,
    Would have reverted to
 my bow again,
    And not where I had aim'd them.
  Laer. And so have I a noble father lost;
   
 A sister driven into desp'rate terms,
    Whose worth, if praises may go back again,
    Stood ch
allenger on mount of all the age
    For her perfections. But my revenge will come.
  King. Break 
not your sleeps for that. You must not think
    That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
    Th
at we can let our beard be shook with danger,
    And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more
.
    I lov'd your father, and we love ourself,
    And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine-


                 Enter a Messenger with letters.

    How now? What news?
  Mess. Letters, my l
ord, from Hamlet:
    This to your Majesty; this to the Queen.
  King. From Hamlet? Who brought th
em?
  Mess. Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not.
    They were given me by Claudio; he rece
iv'd them
    Of him that brought them.
  King. Laertes, you shall hear them.
    Leave us.
    
                                             Exit Messenger.
    [Reads]'High and Mighty,-You shall
 know I am set naked on
your
    kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes;
  
  when I shall (first asking your pardon thereunto) recount the
    occasion of my sudden and more 
strange return.
                                                     'HAMLET.'
    What should thi
s mean? Are all the rest come back?
    Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?
  Laer. Know you t
he hand?
  King. 'Tis Hamlet's character. 'Naked!'
    And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'

    Can you advise me?
  Laer. I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come!
    It warms the very 
sickness in my heart
    That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,
    'Thus didest thou.'
  K
ing. If it be so, Laertes
    (As how should it be so? how otherwise?),
    Will you be rul'd by m
e?
  Laer. Ay my lord,
    So you will not o'errule me to a peace.
  King. To thine own peace. If
 he be now return'd
    As checking at his voyage, and that he means
    No more to undertake it, 
I will work him
    To exploit now ripe in my device,
    Under the which he shall not choose but 
fall;
    And for his death no wind shall breathe
    But even his mother shall uncharge the pract
ice
    And call it accident.
  Laer. My lord, I will be rul'd;
    The rather, if you could devi
se it so
    That I might be the organ.
  King. It falls right.
    You have been talk'd of since
 your travel much,
    And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality
    Wherein they say you shine,
 Your sum of parts
    Did not together pluck such envy from him
    As did that one; and that, in
 my regard,
    Of the unworthiest siege.
  Laer. What part is that, my lord?
  King. A very riba
nd in the cap of youth-
    Yet needfull too; for youth no less becomes
    The light and careless
 livery that it wears
    Than settled age his sables and his weeds,
    Importing health and grav
eness. Two months since
    Here was a gentleman of Normandy.
    I have seen myself, and serv'd a
gainst, the French,
    And they can well on horseback; but this gallant
    Had witchcraft in't. 
He grew unto his seat,
    And to such wondrous doing brought his horse
    As had he been incorps
'd and demi-natur'd
    With the brave beast. So far he topp'd my thought
    That I, in forgery o
f shapes and tricks,
    Come short of what he did.
  Laer. A Norman was't?
  King. A Norman.
  
Laer. Upon my life, Lamound.
  King. The very same.
  Laer. I know him well. He is the broach inde
ed
    And gem of all the nation.
  King. He made confession of you;
    And gave you such a mast
erly report
    For art and exercise in your defence,
    And for your rapier most especially,
  
  That he cried out 'twould be a sight indeed
    If one could match you. The scrimers of their nat
ion
    He swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
    If you oppos'd them. Sir, this report of 
his
    Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
    That he could nothing do but wish and beg
    You
r sudden coming o'er to play with you.
    Now, out of this-
  Laer. What out of this, my lord?
 
 King. Laertes, was your father dear to you?
    Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
    A f
ace without a heart,'
  Laer. Why ask you this?
  King. Not that I think you did not love your fat
her;
    But that I know love is begun by time,
    And that I see, in passages of proof,
    Tim
e qualifies the spark and fire of it.
    There lives within the very flame of love
    A kind of 
wick or snuff that will abate it;
    And nothing is at a like goodness still;
    For goodness, g
rowing to a plurisy,
    Dies in his own too-much. That we would do,
    We should do when we woul
d; for this 'would' changes,
    And hath abatements and delays as many
    As there are tongues, 
are hands, are accidents;
    And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
    That hurts by
 easing. But to the quick o' th' ulcer!
    Hamlet comes back. What would you undertake
    To sho
w yourself your father's son in deed
    More than in words?
  Laer. To cut his throat i' th' chur
ch!
  King. No place indeed should murther sanctuarize;
    Revenge should have no bounds. But, go
od Laertes,
    Will you do this? Keep close within your chamber.
    Hamlet return'd shall know y
ou are come home.
    We'll put on those shall praise your excellence
    And set a double varnish
 on the fame
    The Frenchman gave you; bring you in fine together
    And wager on your heads. H
e, being remiss,
    Most generous, and free from all contriving,
    Will not peruse the foils; s
o that with ease,
    Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
    A sword unbated, and, in a pa
ss of practice,
    Requite him for your father.
  Laer. I will do't!
    And for that purpose I'
ll anoint my sword.
    I bought an unction of a mountebank,
    So mortal that, but dip a knife i
n it,
    Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
    Collected from all simples that have virt
ue
    Under the moon, can save the thing from death
    This is but scratch'd withal. I'll touch 
my point
    With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
    It may be death.
  King. Let'
s further think of this,
    Weigh what convenience both of time and means
    May fit us to our s
hape. If this should fall,
    And that our drift look through our bad performance.
    'Twere bet
ter not assay'd. Therefore this project
    Should have a back or second, that might hold
    If t
his did blast in proof. Soft! let me see.
    We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings-
    I ha
't!
    When in your motion you are hot and dry-
    As make your bouts more violent to that end-

    And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepar'd him
    A chalice for the nonce; whereon but s
ipping,
    If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
    Our purpose may hold there.- But stay, 
what noise,

                           Enter Queen.

    How now, sweet queen?
  Queen. One wo
e doth tread upon another's heel,
    So fast they follow. Your sister's drown'd, Laertes.
  Laer.
 Drown'd! O, where?
  Queen. There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
    That shows his hoar leave
s in the glassy stream.
    There with fantastic garlands did she come
    Of crowflowers, nettles
, daisies, and long purples,
    That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
    But our cold maid
s do dead men's fingers call them.
    There on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds
    Clamb'rin
g to hang, an envious sliver broke,
    When down her weedy trophies and herself
    Fell in the w
eeping brook. Her clothes spread wide
    And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up;
    Which ti
me she chaunted snatches of old tunes,
    As one incapable of her own distress,
    Or like a cre
ature native and indued
    Unto that element; but long it could not be
    Till that her garments
, heavy with their drink,
    Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay
    To muddy death.
 
 Laer. Alas, then she is drown'd?
  Queen. Drown'd, drown'd.
  Laer. Too much of water hast thou, 
poor Ophelia,
    And therefore I forbid my tears; but yet
    It is our trick; nature her custom 
holds,
    Let shame say what it will. When these are gone,
    The woman will be out. Adieu, my l
ord.
    I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze
    But that this folly douts it.         
                 Exit.
  King. Let's follow, Gertrude.
    How much I had to do to calm his rage I

    Now fear I this will give it start again;
    Therefore let's follow.
                      
                                   Exeunt.

ACT V. Scene I.
Elsinore. A churchy
ard.

Enter two Clowns, [with spades and pickaxes].

  Clown. Is she to be buried in Christian b
urial when she
wilfully
    seeks her own salvation?
  Other. I tell thee she is; therefore make 
her grave straight.
    The crowner hath sate on her, and finds it Christian burial.
  Clown. How 
can that be, unless she drown'd herself in her own
    defence?
  Other. Why, 'tis found so.
  Cl
own. It must be se offendendo; it cannot be else. For here
lies
    the point: if I drown myself w
ittingly, it argues an act; and
an
    act hath three branches-it is to act, to do, and to perform
;
    argal, she drown'd herself wittingly.
  Other. Nay, but hear you, Goodman Delver!
  Clown. 
Give me leave. Here lies the water; good. Here stands
the
    man; good. If the man go to this wat
er and drown himself, it
is,
    will he nill he, he goes- mark you that. But if the water
come t
o
    him and drown him, he drowns not himself. Argal, he that is
not
    guilty of his own death
 shortens not his own life.
  Other. But is this law?
  Clown. Ay, marry, is't- crowner's quest la
w.
  Other. Will you ha' the truth an't? If this had not been a
    gentlewoman, she should have b
een buried out o' Christian
burial.
  Clown. Why, there thou say'st! And the more pity that great

folk
    should have count'nance in this world to drown or hang
themselves
    more than their e
ven-Christian. Come, my spade! There is no
    ancient gentlemen but gard'ners, ditchers, and grave
-makers.
They
    hold up Adam's profession.
  Other. Was he a gentleman?
  Clown. 'A was the fi
rst that ever bore arms.
  Other. Why, he had none.
  Clown. What, art a heathen? How dost thou un
derstand the
Scripture?
    The Scripture says Adam digg'd. Could he dig without arms?
I'll
    
put another question to thee. If thou answerest me not to the
    purpose, confess thyself-
  Othe
r. Go to!
  Clown. What is he that builds stronger than either the mason,
the
    shipwright, or 
the carpenter?
  Other. The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand
    tenants.
  Clow
n. I like thy wit well, in good faith. The gallows does
well.
    But how does it well? It does we
ll to those that do ill. Now,
    thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the
    
church. Argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To't again,
come!
  Other. Who builds stronger tha
n a mason, a shipwright, or a
    carpenter?
  Clown. Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
  Other. Marr
y, now I can tell!
  Clown. To't.
  Other. Mass, I cannot tell.

                 Enter Hamlet a
nd Horatio afar off.

  Clown. Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull ass
will
    no
t mend his pace with beating; and when you are ask'd this
    question next, say 'a grave-maker.' T
he houses he makes lasts
    till doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan; fetch me a stoup of
    liquo
r.
                                            [Exit Second Clown.]


                       [Cl
own digs and] sings.

       In youth when I did love, did love,
         Methought it was very s
weet;
       To contract- O- the time for- a- my behove,
         O, methought there- a- was nothi
ng- a- meet.

  Ham. Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings
at
    grave-maki
ng?
  Hor. Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.
  Ham. 'Tis e'en so. The hand of lit
tle employment hath the
daintier
    sense.
  Clown. (sings)
         But age with his stealing 
steps
           Hath clawed me in his clutch,
         And hath shipped me intil the land,
     
      As if I had never been such.
                                            [Throws up a skull.]


  Ham. That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once. How
the
    knave jowls it to the g
round,as if 'twere Cain's jawbone,
that
    did the first murther! This might be the pate of a
Po
litician,
    which this ass now o'erreaches; one that would circumvent
God,
    might it not?
 
 Hor. It might, my lord.
  Ham. Or of a courtier, which could say 'Good morrow, sweet
lord!
    H
ow dost thou, good lord?' This might be my Lord Such-a-one,
that
    prais'd my Lord Such-a-one's 
horse when he meant to beg it-
might
    it not?
  Hor. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Why, e'en so! and no
w my Lady Worm's, chapless, and
knock'd
    about the mazzard with a sexton's spade. Here's fine

revolution,
    and we had the trick to see't. Did these bones cost no more
the
    breeding but 
to play at loggets with 'em? Mine ache to think
    on't.
  Clown. (Sings)
         A pickaxe and
 a spade, a spade,
           For and a shrouding sheet;
         O, a Pit of clay for to be made

           For such a guest is meet.
                                      Throws up [another skul
l].

  Ham. There's another. Why may not that be the skull of a
lawyer?
    Where be his quiddit
s now, his quillets, his cases, his
tenures,
    and his tricks? Why does he suffer this rude knav
e now to
knock
    him about the sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell
him
    of his ac
tion of battery? Hum! This fellow might be in's time
a
    great buyer of land, with his statutes,
 his recognizances,
his
    fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries. Is this the fine
of
    
his fines, and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his
fine
    pate full of fine dirt? Will h
is vouchers vouch him no more
of
    his purchases, and double ones too, than the length and
brea
dth
    of a pair of indentures? The very conveyances of his lands
will
    scarcely lie in this 
box; and must th' inheritor himself have
no
    more, ha?
  Hor. Not a jot more, my lord.
  Ham.
 Is not parchment made of sheepskins?
  Hor. Ay, my lord, And of calveskins too.
  Ham. They are s
heep and calves which seek out assurance in
that. I
    will speak to this fellow. Whose grave's t
his, sirrah?
  Clown. Mine, sir.

    [Sings] O, a pit of clay for to be made
              For 
such a guest is meet.

  Ham. I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in't.
  Clown. You lie o
ut on't, sir, and therefore 'tis not yours.
    For my part, I do not lie in't, yet it is mine.
  
Ham. Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine. 'Tis
for
    the dead, not for the quick;
 therefore thou liest.
  Clown. 'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away again from me to you.
  Ham. Wh
at man dost thou dig it for?
  Clown. For no man, sir.
  Ham. What woman then?
  Clown. For none 
neither.
  Ham. Who is to be buried in't?
  Clown. One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, 
she's
dead.
  Ham. How absolute the knave is! We must speak by the card, or
    equivocation will
 undo us. By the Lord, Horatio, this three
years
    I have taken note of it, the age is grown so 
picked that the
toe
    of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he
galls
    his k
ibe.- How long hast thou been a grave-maker?
  Clown. Of all the days i' th' year, I came to't that
 day that
our
    last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.
  Ham. How long is that since?
  Clown. 
Cannot you tell that? Every fool can tell that. It was
the
    very day that young Hamlet was born
- he that is mad, and sent
    into England.
  Ham. Ay, marry, why was be sent into England?
  Cl
own. Why, because 'a was mad. 'A shall recover his wits
there;
    or, if 'a do not, 'tis no great
 matter there.
  Ham. Why?
  Clown. 'Twill not he seen in him there. There the men are as
mad as

    he.
  Ham. How came he mad?
  Clown. Very strangely, they say.
  Ham. How strangely?
  Clow
n. Faith, e'en with losing his wits.
  Ham. Upon what ground?
  Clown. Why, here in Denmark. I hav
e been sexton here, man and
boy
    thirty years.
  Ham. How long will a man lie i' th' earth ere
 he rot?
  Clown. Faith, if 'a be not rotten before 'a die (as we have
many
    pocky corses now-
a-days that will scarce hold the laying in,
I
    will last you some eight year or nine year. A ta
nner will
last
    you nine year.
  Ham. Why he more than another?
  Clown. Why, sir, his hide i
s so tann'd with his trade that 'a
will
    keep out water a great while; and your water is a sore

decayer of
    your whoreson dead body. Here's a skull now. This skull hath
lien
    you i' th'
 earth three-and-twenty years.
  Ham. Whose was it?
  Clown. A whoreson, mad fellow's it was. Whos
e do you think it
was?
  Ham. Nay, I know not.
  Clown. A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! 'A p
our'd a flagon
of
    Rhenish on my head once. This same skull, sir, was Yorick's
    skull, the 
King's jester.
  Ham. This?
  Clown. E'en that.
  Ham. Let me see. [Takes the skull.] Alas, poor 
Yorick! I knew
him,
    Horatio. A fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy.
He
    hath
 borne me on his back a thousand times. And now how
abhorred
    in my imagination it is! My gorge
 rises at it. Here hung
those
    lips that I have kiss'd I know not how oft. Where be your
gibes

    now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment that
    were wont to set the table 
on a roar? Not one now, to mock
your
    own grinning? Quite chap- fall'n? Now get you to my lady'
s
    chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this
    favour she must come. Make h
er laugh at that. Prithee,
Horatio,
    tell me one thing.
  Hor. What's that, my lord?
  Ham. D
ost thou think Alexander look'd o' this fashion i' th'
earth?
  Hor. E'en so.
  Ham. And smelt so
? Pah!
                                          [Puts down the skull.]
  Hor. E'en so, my lord.

  Ham. To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not
    imagination trace the noble dust o
f Alexander till he find it
    stopping a bunghole?
  Hor. 'Twere to consider too curiously, to c
onsider so.
  Ham. No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with
modesty
    enough, and l
ikelihood to lead it; as thus: Alexander died,
    Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth into d
ust; the dust
is
    earth; of earth we make loam; and why of that loam (whereto
he
    was conv
erted) might they not stop a beer barrel?
    Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
    Might
 stop a hole to keep the wind away.
    O, that that earth which kept the world in awe
    Should 
patch a wall t' expel the winter's flaw!
    But soft! but soft! aside! Here comes the King-

   
 Enter [priests with] a coffin [in funeral procession], King,
             Queen, Laertes, with Lor
ds attendant.]

    The Queen, the courtiers. Who is this they follow?
    And with such maimed r
ites? This doth betoken
    The corse they follow did with desp'rate hand
    Fordo it own life. '
Twas of some estate.
    Couch we awhile, and mark.
                                         [Reti
res with Horatio.]

  Laer. What ceremony else?
  Ham. That is Laertes,
    A very noble youth. 
Mark.
  Laer. What ceremony else?
  Priest. Her obsequies have been as far enlarg'd
    As we hav
e warranty. Her death was doubtful;
    And, but that great command o'ersways the order,
    She s
hould in ground unsanctified have lodg'd
    Till the last trumpet. For charitable prayers,
    Sh
ards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on her.
    Yet here she is allow'd her virgin rites,
 
   Her maiden strewments, and the bringing home
    Of bell and burial.
  Laer. Must there no more
 be done?
  Priest. No more be done.
    We should profane the service of the dead
    To sing a 
requiem and such rest to her
    As to peace-parted souls.
  Laer. Lay her i' th' earth;
    And 
from her fair and unpolluted flesh
    May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,
    A min
ist'ring angel shall my sister be
    When thou liest howling.
  Ham. What, the fair Ophelia?
  Q
ueen. Sweets to the sweet! Farewell.
                                             [Scatters flowers
.]
    I hop'd thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
    I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'
d, sweet maid,
    And not have strew'd thy grave.
  Laer. O, treble woe
    Fall ten times trebl
e on that cursed head
    Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
    Depriv'd thee of! Hold of
f the earth awhile,
    Till I have caught her once more in mine arms.
                           
                  Leaps in the grave.
    Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead
    Till of t
his flat a mountain you have made
    T' o'ertop old Pelion or the skyish head
    Of blue Olympus
.
  Ham. [comes forward] What is he whose grief
    Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow

    Conjures the wand'ring stars, and makes them stand
    Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I
,
    Hamlet the Dane.                    [Leaps in after Laertes.
  Laer. The devil take thy soul
!
                                            [Grapples with him].
  Ham. Thou pray'st not well.

    I prithee take thy fingers from my throat;
    For, though I am not splenitive and rash,
    Y
et have I in me something dangerous,
    Which let thy wisdom fear. Hold off thy hand!
  King. Plu
ck them asunder.
  Queen. Hamlet, Hamlet!
  All. Gentlemen!
  Hor. Good my lord, be quiet.
     
        [The Attendants part them, and they come out of the
                                       
                  grave.]
  Ham. Why, I will fight with him upon this theme
    Until my eyelids w
ill no longer wag.
  Queen. O my son, what theme?
  Ham. I lov'd Ophelia. Forty thousand brothers

    Could not (with all their quantity of love)
    Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?
  
King. O, he is mad, Laertes.
  Queen. For love of God, forbear him!
  Ham. 'Swounds, show me what 
thou't do.
    Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?
    Woo't drink up esill? 
eat a crocodile?
    I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?
    To outface me with leaping in he
r grave?
    Be buried quick with her, and so will I.
    And if thou prate of mountains, let them
 throw
    Millions of acres on us, till our ground,
    Singeing his pate against the burning zon
e,
    Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
    I'll rant as well as thou.
  Queen. This
 is mere madness;
    And thus a while the fit will work on him.
    Anon, as patient as the femal
e dove
    When that her golden couplets are disclos'd,
    His silence will sit drooping.
  Ham.
 Hear you, sir!
    What is the reason that you use me thus?
    I lov'd you ever. But it is no ma
tter.
    Let Hercules himself do what he may,
    The cat will mew, and dog will have his day.
E
xit.
  King. I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.
                                           
        Exit Horatio.
    [To Laertes] Strengthen your patience in our last night's
speech.
    W
e'll put the matter to the present push.-
    Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.-
    Th
is grave shall have a living monument.
    An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
    Till then in
 patience our proceeding be.
                                                         Exeunt.





Scene II.
Elsinore. A hall in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet and Horatio.

  Ham. So much for th
is, sir; now shall you see the other.
    You do remember all the circumstance?
  Hor. Remember it
, my lord!
  Ham. Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting
    That would not let me sleep. M
ethought I lay
    Worse than the mutinies in the bilboes. Rashly-
    And prais'd be rashness for
 it; let us know,
    Our indiscretion sometime serves us well
    When our deep plots do pall; an
d that should learn us
    There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
    Rough-hew them how we will
-
  Hor. That is most certain.
  Ham. Up from my cabin,
    My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the 
dark
    Grop'd I to find out them; had my desire,
    Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew

    To mine own room again; making so bold
    (My fears forgetting manners) to unseal
    Their
 grand commission; where I found, Horatio
    (O royal knavery!), an exact command,
    Larded wit
h many several sorts of reasons,
    Importing Denmark's health, and England's too,
    With, hoo!
 such bugs and goblins in my life-
    That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
    No, not to st
ay the finding of the axe,
    My head should be struck off.
  Hor. Is't possible?
  Ham. Here's 
the commission; read it at more leisure.
    But wilt thou bear me how I did proceed?
  Hor. I bes
eech you.
  Ham. Being thus benetted round with villanies,
    Or I could make a prologue to my br
ains,
    They had begun the play. I sat me down;
    Devis'd a new commission; wrote it fair.
  
  I once did hold it, as our statists do,
    A baseness to write fair, and labour'd much
    How 
to forget that learning; but, sir, now
    It did me yeoman's service. Wilt thou know
    Th' effe
ct of what I wrote?
  Hor. Ay, good my lord.
  Ham. An earnest conjuration from the King,
    As 
England was his faithful tributary,
    As love between them like the palm might flourish,
    As 
peace should still her wheaten garland wear
    And stand a comma 'tween their amities,
    And ma
ny such-like as's of great charge,
    That, on the view and knowing of these contents,
    Withou
t debatement further, more or less,
    He should the bearers put to sudden death,
    Not shrivin
g time allow'd.
  Hor. How was this seal'd?
  Ham. Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
    I h
ad my father's signet in my purse,
    Which was the model of that Danish seal;
    Folded the wri
t up in the form of th' other,
    Subscrib'd it, gave't th' impression, plac'd it safely,
    The
 changeling never known. Now, the next day
    Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent
   
 Thou know'st already.
  Hor. So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.
  Ham. Why, man, they did m
ake love to this employment!
    They are not near my conscience; their defeat
    Does by their o
wn insinuation grow.
    'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
    Between the pass and fell 
incensed points
    Of mighty opposites.
  Hor. Why, what a king is this!
  Ham. Does it not, thi
nks't thee, stand me now upon-
    He that hath kill'd my king, and whor'd my mother;
    Popp'd i
n between th' election and my hopes;
    Thrown out his angle for my proper life,
    And with suc
h coz'nage- is't not perfect conscience
    To quit him with this arm? And is't not to be damn'd
 
   To let this canker of our nature come
    In further evil?
  Hor. It must be shortly known to h
im from England
    What is the issue of the business there.
  Ham. It will be short; the interim 
is mine,
    And a man's life is no more than to say 'one.'
    But I am very sorry, good Horatio,

    That to Laertes I forgot myself,
    For by the image of my cause I see
    The portraiture 
of his. I'll court his favours.
    But sure the bravery of his grief did put me
    Into a tow'ri
ng passion.
  Hor. Peace! Who comes here?

                 Enter young Osric, a courtier.

  O
sr. Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
  Ham. I humbly thank you, sir. [Aside to Horat
io] Dost know this
    waterfly?
  Hor. [aside to Hamlet] No, my good lord.
  Ham. [aside to Hora
tio] Thy state is the more gracious; for
'tis a
    vice to know him. He hath much land, and ferti
le. Let a beast
be
    lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at the king's mess.
'Tis
    a c
hough; but, as I say, spacious in the possession of dirt.

  Osr. Sweet lord, if your lordship wer
e at leisure, I should
impart
    a thing to you from his Majesty.
  Ham. I will receive it, sir,
 with all diligence of spirit. Put
your
    bonnet to his right use. 'Tis for the head.
  Osr. I 
thank your lordship, it is very hot.
  Ham. No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly.

  Osr. It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
  Ham. But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot 
for my
complexion.
  Osr. Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry, as 'twere- I
cannot
    tell 
how. But, my lord, his Majesty bade me signify to you
that
    he has laid a great wager on your h
ead. Sir, this is the
matter-
  Ham. I beseech you remember.
                           [Hamlet m
oves him to put on his hat.]
  Osr. Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here
is

    newly come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute
gentleman,
    full of most excellent di
fferences, of very soft society and
    great showing. Indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the

card
    or calendar of gentry; for you shall find in him the
continent of
    what part a gent
leman would see.
  Ham. Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you; though, I

    know, to 
divide him inventorially would dozy th' arithmetic
of
    memory, and yet but yaw neither in respe
ct of his quick sail.
    But, in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of
great
    a
rticle, and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as, to
make
    true diction of him, his semb
lable is his mirror, and who
else
    would trace him, his umbrage, nothing more.
  Osr. Your lor
dship speaks most infallibly of him.
  Ham. The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman in o
ur
more
    rawer breath?
  Osr. Sir?
  Hor [aside to Hamlet] Is't not possible to understand in

another
    tongue? You will do't, sir, really.
  Ham. What imports the nomination of this gentl
eman?
  Osr. Of Laertes?
  Hor. [aside] His purse is empty already. All's golden words are
    sp
ent.
  Ham. Of him, sir.
  Osr. I know you are not ignorant-
  Ham. I would you did, sir; yet, in
 faith, if you did, it would
not
    much approve me. Well, sir?
  Osr. You are not ignorant of w
hat excellence Laertes is-
  Ham. I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in
    e
xcellence; but to know a man well were to know himself.
  Osr. I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in 
the imputation laid on
him
    by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.
  Ham. What's his weapon?
 
 Osr. Rapier and dagger.
  Ham. That's two of his weapons- but well.
  Osr. The King, sir, hath wa
ger'd with him six Barbary horses;
    against the which he has impon'd, as I take it, six French

    rapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers,
and
    so. Three of the carriag
es, in faith, are very dear to fancy,
    very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, an
d of
    very liberal conceit.
  Ham. What call you the carriages?
  Hor. [aside to Hamlet] I kne
w you must be edified by the
margent
    ere you had done.
  Osr. The carriages, sir, are the han
gers.
  Ham. The phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could
    carry cannon by our si
des. I would it might be hangers till
then.
    But on! Six Barbary horses against six French swor
ds, their
    assigns, and three liberal-conceited carriages: that's the
French
    bet against t
he Danish. Why is this all impon'd, as you call
it?
  Osr. The King, sir, hath laid that, in a doz
en passes between
    yourself and him, he shall not exceed you three hits; he hath
    laid on tw
elve for nine, and it would come to immediate trial
    if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer
.
  Ham. How if I answer no?
  Osr. I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
  Ha
m. Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please his
Majesty,
    it is the breathing time of da
y with me. Let the foils be
    brought, the gentleman willing, and the King hold his
purpose,
  
  I will win for him if I can; if not, I will gain nothing but
my
    shame and the odd hits.
  O
sr. Shall I redeliver you e'en so?
  Ham. To this effect, sir, after what flourish your nature will
.
  Osr. I commend my duty to your lordship.
  Ham. Yours, yours. [Exit Osric.] He does well to co
mmend it
    himself; there are no tongues else for's turn.
  Hor. This lapwing runs away with the
 shell on his head.
  Ham. He did comply with his dug before he suck'd it. Thus has
he,
    and m
any more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age
dotes
    on, only got the tune of the time a
nd outward habit of
encounter-
    a kind of yesty collection, which carries them through and
   
 through the most fann'd and winnowed opinions; and do but
blow
    them to their trial-the bubble
s are out,

                            Enter a Lord.

  Lord. My lord, his Majesty commended hi
m to you by young Osric,
who
    brings back to him, that you attend him in the hall. He sends
to

    know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you
will
    take longer time.
  H
am. I am constant to my purposes; they follow the King's
pleasure.
    If his fitness speaks, mine
 is ready; now or whensoever,
provided
    I be so able as now.
  Lord. The King and Queen and al
l are coming down.
  Ham. In happy time.
  Lord. The Queen desires you to use some gentle entertai
nment to
    Laertes before you fall to play.
  Ham. She well instructs me.
                     
                               [Exit Lord.]
  Hor. You will lose this wager, my lord.
  Ham. I do 
not think so. Since he went into France I have been
in
    continual practice. I shall win at the 
odds. But thou wouldst
not
    think how ill all's here about my heart. But it is no matter.
  Ho
r. Nay, good my lord -
  Ham. It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gaingiving as
    would 
perhaps trouble a woman.
  Hor. If your mind dislike anything, obey it. I will forestall
their
  
  repair hither and say you are not fit.
  Ham. Not a whit, we defy augury; there's a special provi
dence
in
    the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not to come; if it
be
    not to come, it
 will be now; if it be not now, yet it will
come:
    the readiness is all. Since no man knows aug
ht of what he
leaves,
    what is't to leave betimes? Let be.

    Enter King, Queen, Laertes, O
sric, and Lords, with other
              Attendants with foils and gauntlets.
               A ta
ble and flagons of wine on it.

  King. Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
         
           [The King puts Laertes' hand into Hamlet's.]
  Ham. Give me your pardon, sir. I have don
e you wrong;
    But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.
    This presence knows,
    And you must 
needs have heard, how I am punish'd
    With sore distraction. What I have done
    That might you
r nature, honour, and exception
    Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
    Was't Hamlet w
rong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet.
    If Hamlet from himself be taken away,
    And when he's not hims
elf does wrong Laertes,
    Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
    Who does it, then? His 
madness. If't be so,
    Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
    His madness is poor Hamlet'
s enemy.
    Sir, in this audience,
    Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd evil
    Free me so fa
r in your most generous thoughts
    That I have shot my arrow o'er the house
    And hurt my brot
her.
  Laer. I am satisfied in nature,
    Whose motive in this case should stir me most
    To m
y revenge. But in my terms of honour
    I stand aloof, and will no reconcilement
    Till by some
 elder masters of known honour
    I have a voice and precedent of peace
    To keep my name ungor
'd. But till that time
    I do receive your offer'd love like love,
    And will not wrong it.
 
 Ham. I embrace it freely,
    And will this brother's wager frankly play.
    Give us the foils. 
Come on.
  Laer. Come, one for me.
  Ham. I'll be your foil, Laertes. In mine ignorance
    Your 
skill shall, like a star i' th' darkest night,
    Stick fiery off indeed.
  Laer. You mock me, si
r.
  Ham. No, by this hand.
  King. Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
    You know
 the wager?
  Ham. Very well, my lord.
    Your Grace has laid the odds o' th' weaker side.
  Kin
g. I do not fear it, I have seen you both;
    But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.
 
 Laer. This is too heavy; let me see another.
  Ham. This likes me well. These foils have all a len
gth?
                                                Prepare to play.
  Osr. Ay, my good lord.
  
King. Set me the stoups of wine upon that table.
    If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
    O
r quit in answer of the third exchange,
    Let all the battlements their ordnance fire;
    The K
ing shall drink to Hamlet's better breath,
    And in the cup an union shall he throw
    Richer t
han that which four successive kings
    In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;
    And l
et the kettle to the trumpet speak,
    The trumpet to the cannoneer without,
    The cannons to t
he heavens, the heaven to earth,
    'Now the King drinks to Hamlet.' Come, begin.
    And you the
 judges, bear a wary eye.
  Ham. Come on, sir.
  Laer. Come, my lord.                             
   They play.
  Ham. One.
  Laer. No.
  Ham. Judgment!
  Osr. A hit, a very palpable hit.
  Lae
r. Well, again!
  King. Stay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
    Here's to thy health
.
               [Drum; trumpets sound; a piece goes off [within].
    Give him the cup.
  Ham. I
'll play this bout first; set it by awhile.
    Come. (They play.) Another hit. What say you?
  La
er. A touch, a touch; I do confess't.
  King. Our son shall win.
  Queen. He's fat, and scant of b
reath.
    Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows.
    The Queen carouses to thy fortune, Ham
let.
  Ham. Good madam!
  King. Gertrude, do not drink.
  Queen. I will, my lord; I pray you pard
on me.          Drinks.
  King. [aside] It is the poison'd cup; it is too late.
  Ham. I dare not 
drink yet, madam; by-and-by.
  Queen. Come, let me wipe thy face.
  Laer. My lord, I'll hit him no
w.
  King. I do not think't.
  Laer. [aside] And yet it is almost against my conscience.
  Ham. C
ome for the third, Laertes! You but dally.
    Pray you pass with your best violence;
    I am afe
ard you make a wanton of me.
  Laer. Say you so? Come on.                               Play.
  Os
r. Nothing neither way.
  Laer. Have at you now!
                [Laertes wounds Hamlet; then] in 
scuffling, they
                    change rapiers, [and Hamlet wounds Laertes].
  King. Part them
! They are incens'd.
  Ham. Nay come! again!                         The Queen falls.

  Osr. Loo
k to the Queen there, ho!
  Hor. They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?
  Osr. How is't, La
ertes?
  Laer. Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric.
    I am justly kill'd with mine own
 treachery.
  Ham. How does the Queen?
  King. She sounds to see them bleed.
  Queen. No, no! the
 drink, the drink! O my dear Hamlet!
    The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.                 [Dies
.]
  Ham. O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd.
    Treachery! Seek it out.
                    
                            [Laertes falls.]
  Laer. It is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain;
 
   No medicine in the world can do thee good.
    In thee there is not half an hour of life.
    T
he treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
    Unbated and envenom'd. The foul practice
    Hath tu
rn'd itself on me. Lo, here I lie,
    Never to rise again. Thy mother's poison'd.
    I can no mo
re. The King, the King's to blame.
  Ham. The point envenom'd too?
    Then, venom, to thy work.  
                  Hurts the King.
  All. Treason! treason!
  King. O, yet defend me, friends! I am
 but hurt.
  Ham. Here, thou incestuous, murd'rous, damned Dane,
    Drink off this potion! Is thy
 union here?
    Follow my mother.                                 King dies.
  Laer. He is justly
 serv'd.
    It is a poison temper'd by himself.
    Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet.

    Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
    Nor thine on me!                            
           Dies.
  Ham. Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.
    I am dead, Horatio. Wretch
ed queen, adieu!
    You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
    That are but mutes or audi
ence to this act,
    Had I but time (as this fell sergeant, Death,
    Is strict in his arrest) O
, I could tell you-
    But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;
    Thou liv'st; report me and my cause
 aright
    To the unsatisfied.
  Hor. Never believe it.
    I am more an antique Roman than a Da
ne.
    Here's yet some liquor left.
  Ham. As th'art a man,
    Give me the cup. Let go! By heav
en, I'll ha't.
    O good Horatio, what a wounded name
    (Things standing thus unknown) shall li
ve behind me!
    If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,
    Absent thee from felicity awhile,

    And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
    To tell my story.         [March afar off,
 and shot within.]
    What warlike noise is this?
  Osr. Young Fortinbras, with conquest come fro
m Poland,
    To the ambassadors of England gives
    This warlike volley.
  Ham. O, I die, Horat
io!
    The potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit.
    I cannot live to hear the news from Engla
nd,
    But I do prophesy th' election lights
    On Fortinbras. He has my dying voice.
    So te
ll him, with th' occurrents, more and less,
    Which have solicited- the rest is silence.         
    Dies.
  Hor. Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince,
    And flights of angels sin
g thee to thy rest!
                                                 [March within.]
    Why does 
the drum come hither?

    Enter Fortinbras and English Ambassadors, with Drum,
                 
 Colours, and Attendants.

  Fort. Where is this sight?
  Hor. What is it you will see?
    If a
ught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
  Fort. This quarry cries on havoc. O proud Death,
    W
hat feast is toward in thine eternal cell
    That thou so many princes at a shot
    So bloodily 
hast struck.
  Ambassador. The sight is dismal;
    And our affairs from England come too late.
 
   The ears are senseless that should give us hearing
    To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd

    That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.
    Where should we have our thanks?
  Hor. Not f
rom his mouth,
    Had it th' ability of life to thank you.
    He never gave commandment for thei
r death.
    But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
    You from the Polack wars, and you f
rom England,
    Are here arriv'd, give order that these bodies
    High on a stage be placed to t
he view;
    And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
    How these things came about. So shall
 you hear
    Of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts;
    Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters
;
    Of deaths put on by cunning and forc'd cause;
    And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
   
 Fall'n on th' inventors' heads. All this can I
    Truly deliver.
  Fort. Let us haste to hear it
,
    And call the noblest to the audience.
    For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.
    I h
ave some rights of memory in this kingdom
    Which now, to claim my vantage doth invite me.
  Hor
. Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
    And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more.

    But let this same be presently perform'd,
    Even while men's minds are wild, lest more mischa
nce
    On plots and errors happen.
  Fort. Let four captains
    Bear Hamlet like a soldier to t
he stage;
    For he was likely, had he been put on,
    To have prov'd most royally; and for his 
passage
    The soldiers' music and the rites of war
    Speak loudly for him.
    Take up the bo
dies. Such a sight as this
    Becomes the field but here shows much amiss.
    Go, bid the soldie
rs shoot.
            Exeunt marching; after the which a peal of ordnance
                        
                           are shot off.

AC
T I. Scene I.
Elsinore. A platform before the Castle.

Enter two Sentinels-[first,] Francisco, [w
ho paces up and down
at his post; then] Bernardo, [who approaches him].

  Ber. Who's there?
  F
ran. Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.
  Ber. Long live the King!
  Fran. Bernardo?
  Be
r. He.
  Fran. You come most carefully upon your hour.
  Ber. 'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to 
bed, Francisco.
  Fran. For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold,
    And I am sick at heart.

  Ber. Have you had quiet guard?
  Fran. Not a mouse stirring.
  Ber. Well, good night.
    If 
you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
    The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.

            
        Enter Horatio and Marcellus.

  Fran. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?
  Hor
. Friends to this ground.
  Mar. And liegemen to the Dane.
  Fran. Give you good night.
  Mar. O,
 farewell, honest soldier.
    Who hath reliev'd you?
  Fran. Bernardo hath my place.
    Give yo
u good night.                                   Exit.
  Mar. Holla, Bernardo!
  Ber. Say-
    Wha
t, is Horatio there ?
  Hor. A piece of him.
  Ber. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.
  
Mar. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
  Ber. I have seen nothing.
  Mar. Horatio says
 'tis but our fantasy,
    And will not let belief take hold of him
    Touching this dreaded sigh
t, twice seen of us.
    Therefore I have entreated him along,
    With us to watch the minutes of
 this night,
    That, if again this apparition come,
    He may approve our eyes and speak to it.

  Hor. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
  Ber. Sit down awhile,
    And let us once again assail y
our ears,
    That are so fortified against our story,
    What we two nights have seen.
  Hor. W
ell, sit we down,
    And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
  Ber. Last night of all,
    When 
yond same star that's westward from the pole
    Had made his course t' illume that part of heaven

    Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
    The bell then beating one-

                  
      Enter Ghost.

  Mar. Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!
  Ber. In the same f
igure, like the King that's dead.
  Mar. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
  Ber. Looks it
 not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.
  Hor. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.
  Ber.
 It would be spoke to.
  Mar. Question it, Horatio.
  Hor. What art thou that usurp'st this time o
f night
    Together with that fair and warlike form
    In which the majesty of buried Denmark
 
   Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!
  Mar. It is offended.
  Ber. See, it stalk
s away!
  Hor. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!
                                          
           Exit Ghost.
  Mar. 'Tis gone and will not answer.
  Ber. How now, Horatio? You tremble 
and look pale.
    Is not this something more than fantasy?
    What think you on't?
  Hor. Befor
e my God, I might not this believe
    Without the sensible and true avouch
    Of mine own eyes.

  Mar. Is it not like the King?
  Hor. As thou art to thyself.
    Such was the very armour he ha
d on
    When he th' ambitious Norway combated.
    So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,
 
   He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
    'Tis strange.
  Mar. Thus twice before, and jump a
t this dead hour,
    With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
  Hor. In what particular thou
ght to work I know not;
    But, in the gross and scope of my opinion,
    This bodes some strange
 eruption to our state.
  Mar. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows,
    Why this same st
rict and most observant watch
    So nightly toils the subject of the land,
    And why such daily
 cast of brazen cannon
    And foreign mart for implements of war;
    Why such impress of shipwri
ghts, whose sore task
    Does not divide the Sunday from the week.
    What might be toward, that
 this sweaty haste
    Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day?
    Who is't that can info
rm me?
  Hor. That can I.
    At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
    Whose image even 
but now appear'd to us,
    Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
    Thereto prick'd on by a
 most emulate pride,
    Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet
    (For so this side of
 our known world esteem'd him)
    Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,
    Well ra
tified by law and heraldry,
    Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
    Which he stood
 seiz'd of, to the conqueror;
    Against the which a moiety competent
    Was gaged by our king; 
which had return'd
    To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
    Had he been vanquisher, as, by the sa
me cov'nant
    And carriage of the article design'd,
    His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fort
inbras,
    Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
    Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,

    Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
    For food and diet, to some enterprise
    That hat
h a stomach in't; which is no other,
    As it doth well appear unto our state,
    But to recover
 of us, by strong hand
    And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
    So by his father lost;
 and this, I take it,
    Is the main motive of our preparations,
    The source of this our watch
, and the chief head
    Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
  Ber. I think it be no other 
but e'en so.
    Well may it sort that this portentous figure
    Comes armed through our watch, s
o like the King
    That was and is the question of these wars.
  Hor. A mote it is to trouble the
 mind's eye.
    In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
    A little ere the mightiest Julius f
ell,
    The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead
    Did squeak and gibber in the Roman 
streets;
    As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood,
    Disasters in the sun; and the mo
ist star
    Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
    Was sick almost to doomsday with ecl
ipse.
    And even the like precurse of fierce events,
    As harbingers preceding still the fates

    And prologue to the omen coming on,
    Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
    Unto
 our climature and countrymen.

                      Enter Ghost again.

    But soft! behold! 
Lo, where it comes again!
    I'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!
                 
                              Spreads his arms.
    If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
    S
peak to me.
    If there be any good thing to be done,
    That may to thee do ease, and, race to 
me,
    Speak to me.
    If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
    Which happily foreknowing m
ay avoid,
    O, speak!
    Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
    Extorted treasure in the wo
mb of earth
    (For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death),
                            
                     The cock crows.
    Speak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!
  Mar.
 Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
  Hor. Do, if it will not stand.
  Ber. 'Tis here!
  Hor.
 'Tis here!
  Mar. 'Tis gone!
                                                     Exit Ghost.
  
  We do it wrong, being so majestical,
    To offer it the show of violence;
    For it is as the 
air, invulnerable,
    And our vain blows malicious mockery.
  Ber. It was about to speak, when th
e cock crew.
  Hor. And then it started, like a guilty thing
    Upon a fearful summons. I have he
ard
    The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
    Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding thr
oat
    Awake the god of day; and at his warning,
    Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
  
  Th' extravagant and erring spirit hies
    To his confine; and of the truth herein
    This pres
ent object made probation.
  Mar. It faded on the crowing of the cock.
    Some say that ever, 'ga
inst that season comes
    Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
    The bird of dawning sing
eth all night long;
    And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,
    The nights are wholeso
me, then no planets strike,
    No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
    So hallow'd and
 so gracious is the time.
  Hor. So have I heard and do in part believe it.
    But look, the morn
, in russet mantle clad,
    Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.
    Break we our watch 
up; and by my advice
    Let us impart what we have seen to-night
    Unto young Hamlet; for, upon
 my life,
    This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
    Do you consent we shall acquaint him
 with it,
    As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
    Let's do't, I pray; and I this mornin
g know
    Where we shall find him most conveniently.           Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinor
e. A room of state in the Castle.

Flourish. [Enter Claudius, King of Denmark, Gertrude the Queen,

Hamlet,
Polonius, Laertes and his sister Ophelia, [Voltemand, Cornelius,]
Lords Attendant.

  
King. Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
    The memory be green, and that it us befitte
d
    To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom
    To be contracted in one brow of woe,

    Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
    That we with wisest sorrow think on him
   
 Together with remembrance of ourselves.
    Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
    Th'
 imperial jointress to this warlike state,
    Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,
    With an
 auspicious, and a dropping eye,
    With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,
    In equ
al scale weighing delight and dole,
    Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd
    Your better w
isdoms, which have freely gone
    With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
    Now follows, t
hat you know, young Fortinbras,
    Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
    Or thinking by our l
ate dear brother's death
    Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
    Colleagued with this d
ream of his advantage,
    He hath not fail'd to pester us with message
    Importing the surrende
r of those lands
    Lost by his father, with all bands of law,
    To our most valiant brother. S
o much for him.
    Now for ourself and for this time of meeting.
    Thus much the business is: w
e have here writ
    To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,
    Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely 
hears
    Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress
    His further gait herein, in that the levie
s,
    The lists, and full proportions are all made
    Out of his subject; and we here dispatch

    You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,
    For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,
    G
iving to you no further personal power
    To business with the King, more than the scope
    Of t
hese dilated articles allow.            [Gives a paper.]
    Farewell, and let your haste commend y
our duty.
  Cor., Volt. In that, and all things, will we show our duty.
  King. We doubt it nothin
g. Heartily farewell.
                                 Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius.
    And now
, Laertes, what's the news with you?
    You told us of some suit. What is't, Laertes?
    You can
not speak of reason to the Dane
    And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
    That 
shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
    The head is not more native to the heart,
    The hand 
more instrumental to the mouth,
    Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
    What wouldst 
thou have, Laertes?
  Laer. My dread lord,
    Your leave and favour to return to France;
    Fro
m whence though willingly I came to Denmark
    To show my duty in your coronation,
    Yet now I 
must confess, that duty done,
    My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
    And bow them
 to your gracious leave and pardon.
  King. Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
  Po
l. He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
    By laboursome petition, and at last
    Upon 
his will I seal'd my hard consent.
    I do beseech you give him leave to go.
  King. Take thy fai
r hour, Laertes. Time be thine,
    And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
    But now, my cous
in Hamlet, and my son-
  Ham. [aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind!
  King. How is i
t that the clouds still hang on you?
  Ham. Not so, my lord. I am too much i' th' sun.
  Queen. Go
od Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
    And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
    D
o not for ever with thy vailed lids
    Seek for thy noble father in the dust.
    Thou know'st 't
is common. All that lives must die,
    Passing through nature to eternity.
  Ham. Ay, madam, it i
s common.
  Queen. If it be,
    Why seems it so particular with thee?
  Ham. Seems, madam, Nay, 
it is. I know not 'seems.'
    'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
    Nor customary suits 
of solemn black,
    Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,
    No, nor the fruitful river in the
 eye,
    Nor the dejected havior of the visage,
    Together with all forms, moods, shapes of gri
ef,
    'That can denote me truly. These indeed seem,
    For they are actions that a man might pl
ay;
    But I have that within which passeth show-
    These but the trappings and the suits of wo
e.
  King. 'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
    To give these mourning duties to
 your father;
    But you must know, your father lost a father;
    That father lost, lost his, an
d the survivor bound
    In filial obligation for some term
    To do obsequious sorrow. But to pe
rsever
    In obstinate condolement is a course
    Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief;

    It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
    A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
    An un
derstanding simple and unschool'd;
    For what we know must be, and is as common
    As any the m
ost vulgar thing to sense,
    Why should we in our peevish opposition
    Take it to heart? Fie! 
'tis a fault to heaven,
    A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
    To reason most absurd
, whose common theme
    Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
    From the first corse t
ill he that died to-day,
    'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth
    This unprevailing w
oe, and think of us
    As of a father; for let the world take note
    You are the most immediate
 to our throne,
    And with no less nobility of love
    Than that which dearest father bears his
 son
    Do I impart toward you. For your intent
    In going back to school in Wittenberg,
    I
t is most retrograde to our desire;
    And we beseech you, bend you to remain
    Here in the che
er and comfort of our eye,
    Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
  Queen. Let not thy mo
ther lose her prayers, Hamlet.
    I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.
  Ham. I shall 
in all my best obey you, madam.
  King. Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.
    Be as ourself in 
Denmark. Madam, come.
    This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet
    Sits smiling to my heart; 
in grace whereof,
    No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day
    But the great cannon to the 
clouds shall tell,
    And the King's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,
    Respeaking earthly t
hunder. Come away.
                                Flourish. Exeunt all but Hamlet.
  Ham. O that 
this too too solid flesh would melt,
    Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!
    Or that the Ever
lasting had not fix'd
    His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
    How weary, stale, flat
, and unprofitable
    Seem to me all the uses of this world!
    Fie on't! ah, fie! 'Tis an unwee
ded garden
    That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
    Possess it merely. That it 
should come to this!
    But two months dead! Nay, not so much, not two.
    So excellent a king, 
that was to this
    Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
    That he might not beteem the 
winds of heaven
    Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
    Must I remember? Why, she wo
uld hang on him
    As if increase of appetite had grown
    By what it fed on; and yet, within a 
month-
    Let me not think on't! Frailty, thy name is woman!-
    A little month, or ere those sh
oes were old
    With which she followed my poor father's body
    Like Niobe, all tears- why she,
 even she
    (O God! a beast that wants discourse of reason
    Would have mourn'd longer) marrie
d with my uncle;
    My father's brother, but no more like my father
    Than I to Hercules. Withi
n a month,
    Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
    Had left the flushing in her galled 
eyes,
    She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
    With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!

    It is not, nor it cannot come to good.
    But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue!


          Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo.

  Hor. Hail to your lordship!
  Ham. I am glad
 to see you well.
    Horatio!- or I do forget myself.
  Hor. The same, my lord, and your poor ser
vant ever.
  Ham. Sir, my good friend- I'll change that name with you.
    And what make you from 
Wittenberg, Horatio?
    Marcellus?
  Mar. My good lord!
  Ham. I am very glad to see you.- [To B
ernardo] Good even, sir.-

    But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
  Hor. A truant disp
osition, good my lord.
  Ham. I would not hear your enemy say so,
    Nor shall you do my ear that
 violence
    To make it truster of your own report
    Against yourself. I know you are no truant
.
    But what is your affair in Elsinore?
    We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
  Ho
r. My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
  Ham. I prithee do not mock me, fellow student.

    I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
  Hor. Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.
  Ha
m. Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats
    Did coldly furnish forth the marriage table
s.
    Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
    Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
    My 
father- methinks I see my father.
  Hor. O, where, my lord?
  Ham. In my mind's eye, Horatio.
  H
or. I saw him once. He was a goodly king.
  Ham. He was a man, take him for all in all.
    I shal
l not look upon his like again.
  Hor. My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
  Ham. Saw? who?
 
 Hor. My lord, the King your father.
  Ham. The King my father?
  Hor. Season your admiration for 
a while
    With an attent ear, till I may deliver
    Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
    T
his marvel to you.
  Ham. For God's love let me hear!
  Hor. Two nights together had these gentlem
en
    (Marcellus and Bernardo) on their watch
    In the dead vast and middle of the night
    B
een thus encount'red. A figure like your father,
    Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
    Appears
 before them and with solemn march
    Goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walk'd
    By thei
r oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
    Within his truncheon's length; whilst they distill'd
    
Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
    Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
    In dread
ful secrecy impart they did,
    And I with them the third night kept the watch;
    Where, as the
y had deliver'd, both in time,
    Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
    The appari
tion comes. I knew your father.
    These hands are not more like.
  Ham. But where was this?
  M
ar. My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
  Ham. Did you not speak to it?
  Hor. My lord, I
 did;
    But answer made it none. Yet once methought
    It lifted up it head and did address
  
  Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
    But even then the morning cock crew loud,
    And 
at the sound it shrunk in haste away
    And vanish'd from our sight.
  Ham. 'Tis very strange.
 
 Hor. As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
    And we did think it writ down in our duty
   
 To let you know of it.
  Ham. Indeed, indeed, sirs. But this troubles me.
    Hold you the watch 
to-night?
  Both [Mar. and Ber.] We do, my lord.
  Ham. Arm'd, say you?
  Both. Arm'd, my lord.

  Ham. From top to toe?
  Both. My lord, from head to foot.
  Ham. Then saw you not his face?
  H
or. O, yes, my lord! He wore his beaver up.
  Ham. What, look'd he frowningly.
  Hor. A countenanc
e more in sorrow than in anger.
  Ham. Pale or red?
  Hor. Nay, very pale.
  Ham. And fix'd his e
yes upon you?
  Hor. Most constantly.
  Ham. I would I had been there.
  Hor. It would have much 
amaz'd you.
  Ham. Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
  Hor. While one with moderate haste migh
t tell a hundred.
  Both. Longer, longer.
  Hor. Not when I saw't.
  Ham. His beard was grizzled-
 no?
  Hor. It was, as I have seen it in his life,
    A sable silver'd.
  Ham. I will watch to-n
ight.
    Perchance 'twill walk again.
  Hor. I warr'nt it will.
  Ham. If it assume my noble fat
her's person,
    I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
    And bid me hold my peace. I
 pray you all,
    If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
    Let it be tenable in your silenc
e still;
    And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
    Give it an understanding but no tongue.

    I will requite your loves. So, fare you well.
    Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,

    I'll visit you.
  All. Our duty to your honour.
  Ham. Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell.

                                        Exeunt [all but Hamlet].
    My father's spirit- in arms? 
All is not well.
    I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come!
    Till then sit still, m
y soul. Foul deeds will rise,
    Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
Exit.





Scene III.
Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius.

Enter Laertes and Ophelia.

  Laer. M
y necessaries are embark'd. Farewell.
    And, sister, as the winds give benefit
    And convoy is
 assistant, do not sleep,
    But let me hear from you.
  Oph. Do you doubt that?
  Laer. For Ham
let, and the trifling of his favour,
    Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood;
    A violet in th
e youth of primy nature,
    Forward, not permanent- sweet, not lasting;
    The perfume and suppl
iance of a minute;
    No more.
  Oph. No more but so?
  Laer. Think it no more.
    For nature 
crescent does not grow alone
    In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,
    The inward servi
ce of the mind and soul
    Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
    And now no soil nor c
autel doth besmirch
    The virtue of his will; but you must fear,
    His greatness weigh'd, his 
will is not his own;
    For he himself is subject to his birth.
    He may not, as unvalued perso
ns do,
    Carve for himself, for on his choice depends
    The safety and health of this whole st
ate,
    And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd
    Unto the voice and yielding of that bo
dy
    Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
    It fits your wisdom so far to bel
ieve it
    As he in his particular act and place
    May give his saying deed; which is no furthe
r
    Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
    Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain

    If with too credent ear you list his songs,
    Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure o
pen
    To his unmast'red importunity.
    Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
    And kee
p you in the rear of your affection,
    Out of the shot and danger of desire.
    The chariest ma
id is prodigal enough
    If she unmask her beauty to the moon.
    Virtue itself scopes not calum
nious strokes.
    The canker galls the infants of the spring
    Too oft before their buttons be 
disclos'd,
    And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
    Contagious blastments are most imminent
.
    Be wary then; best safety lies in fear.
    Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.

  Oph. I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep
    As watchman to my heart. But, good my brothe
r,
    Do not as some ungracious pastors do,
    Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven,
    
Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
    Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads
  
  And recks not his own rede.
  Laer. O, fear me not!

                       Enter Polonius.


    I stay too long. But here my father comes.
    A double blessing is a double grace;
    Occasi
on smiles upon a second leave.
  Pol. Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame!
    The wind s
its in the shoulder of your sail,
    And you are stay'd for. There- my blessing with thee!
    An
d these few precepts in thy memory
    Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
    Nor a
ny unproportion'd thought his act.
    Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar:
    Those friends
 thou hast, and their adoption tried,
    Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel;
    But 
do not dull thy palm with entertainment
    Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware
    Of 
entrance to a quarrel; but being in,
    Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee.
    Give ever
y man thine ear, but few thy voice;
    Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
    Cos
tly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
    But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
    For the a
pparel oft proclaims the man,
    And they in France of the best rank and station
    Are most sel
ect and generous, chief in that.
    Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
    For loan oft loses bo
th itself and friend,
    And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
    This above all- to thine 
own self be true,
    And it must follow, as the night the day,
    Thou canst not then be false t
o any man.
    Farewell. My blessing season this in thee!
  Laer. Most humbly do I take my leave, 
my lord.
  Pol. The time invites you. Go, your servants tend.
  Laer. Farewell, Ophelia, and remem
ber well
    What I have said to you.
  Oph. 'Tis in my memory lock'd,
    And you yourself shall
 keep the key of it.
  Laer. Farewell.                                          Exit.
  Pol. What 
is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?
  Oph. So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
  Po
l. Marry, well bethought!
    'Tis told me he hath very oft of late
    Given private time to you,
 and you yourself
    Have of your audience been most free and bounteous.
    If it be so- as so '
tis put on me,
    And that in way of caution- I must tell you
    You do not understand yourself 
so clearly
    As it behooves my daughter and your honour.
    What is between you? Give me up the
 truth.
  Oph. He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
    Of his affection to me.
  Pol. Aff
ection? Pooh! You speak like a green girl,
    Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
    Do you 
believe his tenders, as you call them?
  Oph. I do not know, my lord, what I should think,
  Pol. 
Marry, I will teach you! Think yourself a baby
    That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,

    Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,
    Or (not to crack the wind of the poor
 phrase,
    Running it thus) you'll tender me a fool.
  Oph. My lord, he hath importun'd me with 
love
    In honourable fashion.
  Pol. Ay, fashion you may call it. Go to, go to!
  Oph. And hath
 given countenance to his speech, my lord,
    With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
  Pol. Ay,
 springes to catch woodcocks! I do know,
    When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
    Lends
 the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter,
    Giving more light than heat, extinct in both
    Eve
n in their promise, as it is a-making,
    You must not take for fire. From this time
    Be somet
hing scanter of your maiden presence.
    Set your entreatments at a higher rate
    Than a comman
d to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
    Believe so much in him, that he is young,
    And with a larger 
tether may he walk
    Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia,
    Do not believe his vows; for th
ey are brokers,
    Not of that dye which their investments show,
    But mere implorators of unho
ly suits,
    Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
    The better to beguile. This is for al
l:
    I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth
    Have you so slander any moment leisur
e
    As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
    Look to't, I charge you. Come your ways.

  Oph. I shall obey, my lord.
                                                         Exeunt.





Scene IV.
Elsinore. The platform before the Castle.

Enter Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus.


  Ham. The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
  Hor. It is a nipping and an eager air.
  Ham.
 What hour now?
  Hor. I think it lacks of twelve.
  Mar. No, it is struck.
  Hor. Indeed? I hear
d it not. It then draws near the season
    Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
            
       A flourish of trumpets, and two pieces go off.
    What does this mean, my lord?
  Ham. The
 King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
    Keeps wassail, and the swagg'ring upspring reels,

    And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
    The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out

    The triumph of his pledge.
  Hor. Is it a custom?
  Ham. Ay, marry, is't;
    But to my mind
, though I am native here
    And to the manner born, it is a custom
    More honour'd in the brea
ch than the observance.
    This heavy-headed revel east and west
    Makes us traduc'd and tax'd 
of other nations;
    They clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase
    Soil our addition; and in
deed it takes
    From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
    The pith and marrow of ou
r attribute.
    So oft it chances in particular men
    That, for some vicious mole of nature in 
them,
    As in their birth,- wherein they are not guilty,
    Since nature cannot choose his orig
in,-
    By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
    Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason
,
    Or by some habit that too much o'erleavens
    The form of plausive manners, that these men

    Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
    Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,
    T
heir virtues else- be they as pure as grace,
    As infinite as man may undergo-
    Shall in the 
general censure take corruption
    From that particular fault. The dram of e'il
    Doth all the 
noble substance often dout To his own scandal.

                         Enter Ghost.

  Hor. Lo
ok, my lord, it comes!
  Ham. Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
    Be thou a spirit of hea
lth or goblin damn'd,
    Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
    Be thy intents
 wicked or charitable,
    Thou com'st in such a questionable shape
    That I will speak to thee.
 I'll call thee Hamlet,
    King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me?
    Let me not burst in ignora
nce, but tell
    Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,
    Have burst their cerements; why t
he sepulchre
    Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
    Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws

    To cast thee up again. What may this mean
    That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,

    Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
    Making night hideous, and we fools of nature
    
So horridly to shake our disposition
    With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
    Say, w
hy is this? wherefore? What should we do?
                                           Ghost beckons 
Hamlet.
  Hor. It beckons you to go away with it,
    As if it some impartment did desire
    To 
you alone.
  Mar. Look with what courteous action
    It waves you to a more removed ground.
    
But do not go with it!
  Hor. No, by no means!
  Ham. It will not speak. Then will I follow it.
 
 Hor. Do not, my lord!
  Ham. Why, what should be the fear?
    I do not set my life at a pin's fe
e;
    And for my soul, what can it do to that,
    Being a thing immortal as itself?
    It wave
s me forth again. I'll follow it.
  Hor. What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
    Or to
 the dreadful summit of the cliff
    That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
    And there assum
e some other, horrible form
    Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
    And draw you in
to madness? Think of it.
    The very place puts toys of desperation,
    Without more motive, int
o every brain
    That looks so many fadoms to the sea
    And hears it roar beneath.
  Ham. It w
aves me still.
    Go on. I'll follow thee.
  Mar. You shall not go, my lord.
  Ham. Hold off you
r hands!
  Hor. Be rul'd. You shall not go.
  Ham. My fate cries out
    And makes each petty art
ire in this body
    As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
                                        
        [Ghost beckons.]

    Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
    By heaven, I'll make a
 ghost of him that lets me!-
    I say, away!- Go on. I'll follow thee.
                          
              Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet.
  Hor. He waxes desperate with imagination.
  Mar. Let's fo
llow. 'Tis not fit thus to obey him.
  Hor. Have after. To what issue will this come?
  Mar. Somet
hing is rotten in the state of Denmark.
  Hor. Heaven will direct it.
  Mar. Nay, let's follow him
.
                                                         Exeunt.




Scene V.
Elsinore. The
 Castle. Another part of the fortifications.

Enter Ghost and Hamlet.

  Ham. Whither wilt thou 
lead me? Speak! I'll go no further.
  Ghost. Mark me.
  Ham. I will.
  Ghost. My hour is almost c
ome,
    When I to sulph'rous and tormenting flames
    Must render up myself.
  Ham. Alas, poor 
ghost!
  Ghost. Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
    To what I shall unfold.
  Ham. Spea
k. I am bound to hear.
  Ghost. So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
  Ham. What?
  Ghos
t. I am thy father's spirit,
    Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
    And for the day 
confin'd to fast in fires,
    Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
    Are burnt and pu
rg'd away. But that I am forbid
    To tell the secrets of my prison house,
    I could a tale unf
old whose lightest word
    Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
    Make thy two eye
s, like stars, start from their spheres,
    Thy knotted and combined locks to part,
    And each 
particular hair to stand on end
    Like quills upon the fretful porcupine.
    But this eternal b
lazon must not be
    To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
    If thou didst ever thy 
dear father love-
  Ham. O God!
  Ghost. Revenge his foul and most unnatural murther.
  Ham. Murt
her?
  Ghost. Murther most foul, as in the best it is;
    But this most foul, strange, and unnatu
ral.
  Ham. Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
    As meditation or the thoughts of l
ove,
    May sweep to my revenge.
  Ghost. I find thee apt;
    And duller shouldst thou be than 
the fat weed
    That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
    Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, 
Hamlet, hear.
    'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
    A serpent stung me. So the whol
e ear of Denmark
    Is by a forged process of my death
    Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble yo
uth,
    The serpent that did sting thy father's life
    Now wears his crown.
  Ham. O my prophe
tic soul!
    My uncle?
  Ghost. Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
    With witchcraft 
of his wit, with traitorous gifts-
    O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
    So to seduc
e!- won to his shameful lust
    The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.
    O Hamlet, what a 
falling-off was there,
    From me, whose love was of that dignity
    That it went hand in hand e
ven with the vow
    I made to her in marriage, and to decline
    Upon a wretch whose natural gif
ts were poor
    To those of mine!
    But virtue, as it never will be mov'd,
    Though lewdness
 court it in a shape of heaven,
    So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
    Will sate itsel
f in a celestial bed
    And prey on garbage.
    But soft! methinks I scent the morning air.
   
 Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
    My custom always of the afternoon,
    Upon my s
ecure hour thy uncle stole,
    With juice of cursed hebona in a vial,
    And in the porches of m
y ears did pour
    The leperous distilment; whose effect
    Holds such an enmity with blood of m
an
    That swift as quicksilver it courses through
    The natural gates and alleys of the body,

    And with a sudden vigour it doth posset
    And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
    The
 thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine;
    And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
    Most la
zar-like, with vile and loathsome crust
    All my smooth body.
    Thus was I, sleeping, by a bro
ther's hand
    Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd;
    Cut off even in the blossoms 
of my sin,
    Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd,
    No reckoning made, but sent to my account

    With all my imperfections on my head.
  Ham. O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
  Ghost.
 If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.
    Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
    A couch for
 luxury and damned incest.
    But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
    Taint not thy mind, nor 
let thy soul contrive
    Against thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven,
    And to those thorns t
hat in her bosom lodge
    To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once.
    The glowworm shows 
the matin to be near
    And gins to pale his uneffectual fire.
    Adieu, adieu, adieu! Remember 
me.                      Exit.

  Ham. O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?
    And shal
l I couple hell? Hold, hold, my heart!
    And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
    But bear 
me stiffly up. Remember thee?
    Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
    In this distr
acted globe. Remember thee?
    Yea, from the table of my memory
    I'll wipe away all trivial fo
nd records,
    All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past
    That youth and observation co
pied there,
    And thy commandment all alone shall live
    Within the book and volume of my brai
n,
    Unmix'd with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!
    O most pernicious woman!
    O villain, vil
lain, smiling, damned villain!
    My tables! Meet it is I set it down
    That one may smile, and
 smile, and be a villain;
    At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark.        [Writes.]
    So,
 uncle, there you are. Now to my word:
    It is 'Adieu, adieu! Remember me.'
    I have sworn't.

  Hor. (within) My lord, my lord!

                   Enter Horatio and Marcellus.

  Mar. Lord
 Hamlet!
  Hor. Heaven secure him!
  Ham. So be it!
  Mar. Illo, ho, ho, my lord!
  Ham. Hillo, 
ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.
  Mar. How is't, my noble lord?
  Hor. What news, my lord?
  Mar. 
O, wonderful!
  Hor. Good my lord, tell it.
  Ham. No, you will reveal it.
  Hor. Not I, my lord,
 by heaven!
  Mar. Nor I, my lord.
  Ham. How say you then? Would heart of man once think it?
   
 But you'll be secret?
  Both. Ay, by heaven, my lord.
  Ham. There's neer a villain dwelling in a
ll Denmark
    But he's an arrant knave.
  Hor. There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave

    To tell us this.
  Ham. Why, right! You are in the right!
    And so, without more circumsta
nce at all,
    I hold it fit that we shake hands and part;
    You, as your business and desires 
shall point you,
    For every man hath business and desire,
    Such as it is; and for my own poo
r part,
    Look you, I'll go pray.
  Hor. These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
  Ham.
 I am sorry they offend you, heartily;
    Yes, faith, heartily.
  Hor. There's no offence, my lor
d.
  Ham. Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
    And much offence too. Touching this vi
sion here,
    It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.
    For your desire to know what is be
tween us,
    O'ermaster't as you may. And now, good friends,
    As you are friends, scholars, an
d soldiers,
    Give me one poor request.
  Hor. What is't, my lord? We will.
  Ham. Never make k
nown what you have seen to-night.
  Both. My lord, we will not.
  Ham. Nay, but swear't.
  Hor. I
n faith,
    My lord, not I.
  Mar. Nor I, my lord- in faith.
  Ham. Upon my sword.
  Mar. We ha
ve sworn, my lord, already.
  Ham. Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.

                 Ghost cries u
nder the stage.

  Ghost. Swear.
  Ham. Aha boy, say'st thou so? Art thou there, truepenny?
    
Come on! You hear this fellow in the cellarage.
    Consent to swear.
  Hor. Propose the oath, my 
lord.
  Ham. Never to speak of this that you have seen.
    Swear by my sword.
  Ghost. [beneath]
 Swear.
  Ham. Hic et ubique? Then we'll shift our ground.
    Come hither, gentlemen,
    And la
y your hands again upon my sword.
    Never to speak of this that you have heard:
    Swear by my 
sword.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear by his sword.
  Ham. Well said, old mole! Canst work i' th' earth 
so fast?
    A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends."
  Hor. O day and night, but this is
 wondrous strange!
  Ham. And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
    There are more things i
n heaven and earth, Horatio,
    Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
    But come!
    Here, a
s before, never, so help you mercy,
    How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself
    (As I perchanc
e hereafter shall think meet
    To put an antic disposition on),
    That you, at such times seei
ng me, never shall,
    With arms encumb'red thus, or this head-shake,
    Or by pronouncing of so
me doubtful phrase,
    As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'
    Or 'If we lis
t to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'
    Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
    That y
ou know aught of me- this is not to do,
    So grace and mercy at your most need help you,
    Swe
ar.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
                                                   [They swear.]
  
Ham. Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! So, gentlemen,
    With all my love I do commend me to you;
   
 And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
    May do t' express his love and friending to you,
    God 
willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;
    And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
 
   The time is out of joint. O cursed spite
    That ever I was born to set it right!
    Nay, com
e, let's go together.
                                                         Exeunt.

Act II. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius.

Enter Polonius and Reynaldo
.

  Pol. Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
  Rey. I will, my lord.
  Pol. You shal
l do marvell's wisely, good Reynaldo,
    Before You visit him, to make inquire
    Of his behavio
ur.
  Rey. My lord, I did intend it.
  Pol. Marry, well said, very well said. Look you, sir,
    
Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
    And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,

    What company, at what expense; and finding
    By this encompassment and drift of question
 
   That they do know my son, come you more nearer
    Than your particular demands will touch it.

    Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
    As thus, 'I know his father and his fri
ends,
    And in part him.' Do you mark this, Reynaldo?
  Rey. Ay, very well, my lord.
  Pol. 'An
d in part him, but,' you may say, 'not well.
    But if't be he I mean, he's very wild
    Addicte
d so and so'; and there put on him
    What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
    As may d
ishonour him- take heed of that;
    But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips
    As are compa
nions noted and most known
    To youth and liberty.
  Rey. As gaming, my lord.
  Pol. Ay, or dri
nking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
    Drabbing. You may go so far.
  Rey. My lord, that would
 dishonour him.
  Pol. Faith, no, as you may season it in the charge.
    You must not put another
 scandal on him,
    That he is open to incontinency.
    That's not my meaning. But breathe his f
aults so quaintly
    That they may seem the taints of liberty,
    The flash and outbreak of a fi
ery mind,
    A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
    Of general assault.
  Rey. But, my good lord
-
  Pol. Wherefore should you do this?
  Rey. Ay, my lord,
    I would know that.
  Pol. Marry, 
sir, here's my drift,
    And I believe it is a fetch of warrant.
    You laying these slight sull
ies on my son
    As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' th' working,
    Mark you,
    Your party 
in converse, him you would sound,
    Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
    The youth you
 breathe of guilty, be assur'd
    He closes with you in this consequence:
    'Good sir,' or so, 
or 'friend,' or 'gentleman'-
    According to the phrase or the addition
    Of man and country-

  Rey. Very good, my lord.
  Pol. And then, sir, does 'a this- 'a does- What was I about to
say?

    By the mass, I was about to say something! Where did I leave?
  Rey. At 'closes in the conseque
nce,' at 'friend or so,' and
    gentleman.'
  Pol. At 'closes in the consequence'- Ay, marry!
  
  He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman.
    I saw him yesterday, or t'other day,
    Or then, or 
then, with such or such; and, as you say,
    There was 'a gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
    
There falling out at tennis'; or perchance,
    'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'
    Videli
cet, a brothel, or so forth.
    See you now-
    Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth;

    And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
    With windlasses and with assays of bias,
    By i
ndirections find directions out.
    So, by my former lecture and advice,
    Shall you my son. Yo
u have me, have you not?
  Rey. My lord, I have.
  Pol. God b' wi' ye, fare ye well!
  Rey. Good 
my lord!                                    [Going.]
  Pol. Observe his inclination in yourself.
 
 Rey. I shall, my lord.
  Pol. And let him ply his music.
  Rey. Well, my lord.
  Pol. Farewell!

                                                  Exit Reynaldo.

                       Enter Op
helia.

    How now, Ophelia? What's the matter?
  Oph. O my lord, my lord, I have been so affrig
hted!
  Pol. With what, i' th' name of God?
  Oph. My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
    Lor
d Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac'd,
    No hat upon his head, his stockings foul'd,
    Ungar
t'red, and down-gyved to his ankle;
    Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,
    And 
with a look so piteous in purport
    As if he had been loosed out of hell
    To speak of horrors
- he comes before me.
  Pol. Mad for thy love?
  Oph. My lord, I do not know,
    But truly I do 
fear it.
  Pol. What said he?
  Oph. He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
    Then goes he t
o the length of all his arm,
    And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
    He falls to such
 perusal of my face
    As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so.
    At last, a little shaking of m
ine arm,
    And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
    He rais'd a sigh so piteous and prof
ound
    As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
    And end his being. That done, he lets me go,

    And with his head over his shoulder turn'd
    He seem'd to find his way without his eyes,
   
 For out o' doors he went without their help
    And to the last bended their light on me.
  Pol. 
Come, go with me. I will go seek the King.
    This is the very ecstasy of love,
    Whose violent
 property fordoes itself
    And leads the will to desperate undertakings
    As oft as any passio
n under heaven
    That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
    What, have you given him any har
d words of late?
  Oph. No, my good lord; but, as you did command,
    I did repel his letters and
 denied
    His access to me.
  Pol. That hath made him mad.
    I am sorry that with better heed
 and judgment
    I had not quoted him. I fear'd he did but trifle
    And meant to wrack thee; bu
t beshrew my jealousy!
    By heaven, it is as proper to our age
    To cast beyond ourselves in o
ur opinions
    As it is common for the younger sort
    To lack discretion. Come, go we to the Ki
ng.
    This must be known; which, being kept close, might move
    More grief to hide than hate t
o utter love.
    Come.
                                                         Exeunt.

Scene 
II.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Flourish. [Enter King and Queen, Rosencrantz and Guildenster
n,
cum aliis.

  King. Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
    Moreover that we much did
 long to see you,
    The need we have to use you did provoke
    Our hasty sending. Something hav
e you heard
    Of Hamlet's transformation. So I call it,
    Sith nor th' exterior nor the inward
 man
    Resembles that it was. What it should be,
    More than his father's death, that thus hat
h put him
    So much from th' understanding of himself,
    I cannot dream of. I entreat you both

    That, being of so young days brought up with him,
    And since so neighbour'd to his youth a
nd haviour,
    That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
    Some little time; so by your co
mpanies
    To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather
    So much as from occasion you may glean,

    Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus
    That, open'd, lies within our remedy.
  Qu
een. Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,
    And sure I am two men there are not living
  
  To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
    To show us so much gentry and good will
    A
s to expend your time with us awhile
    For the supply and profit of our hope,
    Your visitatio
n shall receive such thanks
    As fits a king's remembrance.
  Ros. Both your Majesties
    Migh
t, by the sovereign power you have of us,
    Put your dread pleasures more into command
    Than 
to entreaty.
  Guil. But we both obey,
    And here give up ourselves, in the full bent,
    To l
ay our service freely at your feet,
    To be commanded.
  King. Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Gu
ildenstern.
  Queen. Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz.
    And I beseech you instantly 
to visit
    My too much changed son.- Go, some of you,
    And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet
 is.
  Guil. Heavens make our presence and our practices
    Pleasant and helpful to him!
  Queen
. Ay, amen!
                 Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, [with some
                     
                               Attendants].

                         Enter Polonius.

  Pol. Th
' ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
    Are joyfully return'd.
  King. Thou still hast been t
he father of good news.
  Pol. Have I, my lord? Assure you, my good liege,
    I hold my duty as I
 hold my soul,
    Both to my God and to my gracious king;
    And I do think- or else this brain 
of mine
    Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
    As it hath us'd to do- that I have found
  
  The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
  King. O, speak of that! That do I long to hear.
  Pol. Give
 first admittance to th' ambassadors.
    My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
  King. 
Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
                                                [Exit 
Polonius.]
    He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found
    The head and source of all your so
n's distemper.
  Queen. I doubt it is no other but the main,
    His father's death and our o'erha
sty marriage.
  King. Well, we shall sift him.

              Enter Polonius, Voltemand, and Corn
elius.

    Welcome, my good friends.
    Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?
  Volt. 
Most fair return of greetings and desires.
    Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
    His nep
hew's levies; which to him appear'd
    To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack,
    But better loo
k'd into, he truly found
    It was against your Highness; whereat griev'd,
    That so his sickne
ss, age, and impotence
    Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
    On Fortinbras; which h
e, in brief, obeys,
    Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,
    Makes vow before his uncle 
never more
    To give th' assay of arms against your Majesty.
    Whereon old Norway, overcome wi
th joy,
    Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee
    And his commission to employ those s
oldiers,
    So levied as before, against the Polack;
    With an entreaty, herein further shown,

                                                [Gives a paper.]
    That it might please you to g
ive quiet pass
    Through your dominions for this enterprise,
    On such regards of safety and a
llowance
    As therein are set down.
  King. It likes us well;
    And at our more consider'd ti
me we'll read,
    Answer, and think upon this business.
    Meantime we thank you for your well-t
ook labour.
    Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together.
    Most welcome home!            
           Exeunt Ambassadors.
  Pol. This business is well ended.
    My liege, and madam, to exp
ostulate
    What majesty should be, what duty is,
    Why day is day, night is night, and time is
 time.
    Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time.
    Therefore, since brevity is the sou
l of wit,
    And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
    I will be brief. Your noble so
n is mad.
    Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,
    What is't but to be nothing else but
 mad?
    But let that go.
  Queen. More matter, with less art.
  Pol. Madam, I swear I use no ar
t at all.
    That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
    And pity 'tis 'tis true. A fooli
sh figure!
    But farewell it, for I will use no art.
    Mad let us grant him then. And now rema
ins
    That we find out the cause of this effect-
    Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
 
   For this effect defective comes by cause.
    Thus it remains, and the remainder thus.
    Perp
end.
    I have a daughter (have while she is mine),
    Who in her duty and obedience, mark,
   
 Hath given me this. Now gather, and surmise.
                                             [Reads] 
the letter.
    'To the celestial, and my soul's idol, the most beautified
      Ophelia,'-

   
 That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is a vile
      phrase.
    But you shall hear.
 Thus:
                                                        [Reads.]
    'In her excellent whit
e bosom, these, &c.'
  Queen. Came this from Hamlet to her?
  Pol. Good madam, stay awhile. I will
 be faithful.     [Reads.]


          'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
            Doubt that th
e sun doth move;
          Doubt truth to be a liar;
            But never doubt I love.
      'O
 dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers; I have not art
to
    reckon my groans; but that I love 
thee best, O most best,
believe
    it. Adieu.
      'Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this
 machine is to
him,

HAMLET.'

    This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me;
    And more
 above, hath his solicitings,
    As they fell out by time, by means, and place,
    All given to 
mine ear.
  King. But how hath she
    Receiv'd his love?
  Pol. What do you think of me?
  King
. As of a man faithful and honourable.
  Pol. I would fain prove so. But what might you think,
   
 When I had seen this hot love on the wing
    (As I perceiv'd it, I must tell you that,
    Befor
e my daughter told me), what might you,
    Or my dear Majesty your queen here, think,
    If I ha
d play'd the desk or table book,
    Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
    Or look'd upo
n this love with idle sight?
    What might you think? No, I went round to work
    And my young m
istress thus I did bespeak:
    'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star.
    This must not be.' 
And then I prescripts gave her,
    That she should lock herself from his resort,
    Admit no mes
sengers, receive no tokens.
    Which done, she took the fruits of my advice,
    And he, repulsed
, a short tale to make,
    Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
    Thence to a watch, thence i
nto a weakness,
    Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
    Into the madness wherein n
ow he raves,
    And all we mourn for.
  King. Do you think 'tis this?
  Queen. it may be, very l
ike.
  Pol. Hath there been such a time- I would fain know that-
    That I have Positively said '
'Tis so,'
    When it prov'd otherwise.?
  King. Not that I know.
  Pol. [points to his head and 
shoulder] Take this from this, if
this
      be otherwise.
    If circumstances lead me, I will f
ind
    Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
    Within the centre.
  King. How may we t
ry it further?
  Pol. You know sometimes he walks for hours together
    Here in the lobby.
  Que
en. So he does indeed.
  Pol. At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him.
    Be you and I behin
d an arras then.
    Mark the encounter. If he love her not,
    And he not from his reason fall'n
 thereon
    Let me be no assistant for a state,
    But keep a farm and carters.
  King. We will
 try it.

                 Enter Hamlet, reading on a book.

  Queen. But look where sadly the p
oor wretch comes reading.
  Pol. Away, I do beseech you, both away
    I'll board him presently. O
, give me leave.
                       Exeunt King and Queen, [with Attendants].
    How does my 
good Lord Hamlet?
  Ham. Well, God-a-mercy.
  Pol. Do you know me, my lord?
  Ham. Excellent well
. You are a fishmonger.
  Pol. Not I, my lord.
  Ham. Then I would you were so honest a man.
  Po
l. Honest, my lord?
  Ham. Ay, sir. To be honest, as this world goes, is to be one
man
    pick'd
 out of ten thousand.
  Pol. That's very true, my lord.
  Ham. For if the sun breed maggots in a d
ead dog, being a god
    kissing carrion- Have you a daughter?
  Pol. I have, my lord.
  Ham. Let
 her not walk i' th' sun. Conception is a blessing, but
not
    as your daughter may conceive. Fri
end, look to't.
  Pol. [aside] How say you by that? Still harping on my daughter.
Yet
    he knew
 me not at first. He said I was a fishmonger. He is
far
    gone, far gone! And truly in my youth 
I suff'red much
extremity
    for love- very near this. I'll speak to him again.- What do
you
  
  read, my lord?
  Ham. Words, words, words.
  Pol. What is the matter, my lord?
  Ham. Between w
ho?
  Pol. I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
  Ham. Slanders, sir; for the satirical rogu
e says here that old
men
    have grey beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes
    purg
ing thick amber and plum-tree gum; and that they have a
    plentiful lack of wit, together with mo
st weak hams. All
which,
    sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I
hold it
 
   not honesty to have it thus set down; for you yourself, sir,
    should be old as I am if, like 
a crab, you could go backward.

  Pol. [aside] Though this be madness, yet there is a method
in't
.-
   Will You walk out of the air, my lord?
  Ham. Into my grave?
  Pol. Indeed, that is out o' 
th' air. [Aside] How pregnant
sometimes
    his replies are! a happiness that often madness hits o
n,
which
    reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of.
I
    will leave him a
nd suddenly contrive the means of meeting
between
    him and my daughter.- My honourable lord, I 
will most humbly
take
    my leave of you.
  Ham. You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I w
ill more
    willingly part withal- except my life, except my life, except
my
    life,

      
              Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Pol. Fare you well, my lord.
  Ham. These te
dious old fools!
  Pol. You go to seek the Lord Hamlet. There he is.
  Ros. [to Polonius] God save
 you, sir!
                                                Exit [Polonius].

  Guil. My honour'd 
lord!
  Ros. My most dear lord!
  Ham. My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern?
Ah
,
    Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
  Ros. As the indifferent children of the earth.
  
Guil. Happy in that we are not over-happy.
    On Fortune's cap we are not the very button.
  Ham.
 Nor the soles of her shoe?
  Ros. Neither, my lord.
  Ham. Then you live about her waist, or in t
he middle of her
    favours?
  Guil. Faith, her privates we.
  Ham. In the secret parts of Fortu
ne? O! most true! she is a
    strumpet. What news ?
  Ros. None, my lord, but that the world's gr
own honest.
  Ham. Then is doomsday near! But your news is not true. Let me
    question more in p
articular. What have you, my good friends,
    deserved at the hands of Fortune that she sends you 
to prison
    hither?
  Guil. Prison, my lord?
  Ham. Denmark's a prison.
  Ros. Then is the wor
ld one.
  Ham. A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and
    dungeons, Denmark be
ing one o' th' worst.
  Ros. We think not so, my lord.
  Ham. Why, then 'tis none to you; for ther
e is nothing either
good
    or bad but thinking makes it so. To me it is a prison.
  Ros. Why, t
hen your ambition makes it one. 'Tis too narrow for
your
    mind.
  Ham. O God, I could be bound
ed in a nutshell and count myself a
    king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.

  Guil. Which dreams indeed are ambition; for the very substance
of
    the ambitious is merely 
the shadow of a dream.
  Ham. A dream itself is but a shadow.
  Ros. Truly, and I hold ambition of
 so airy and light a quality
that
    it is but a shadow's shadow.
  Ham. Then are our beggars bo
dies, and our monarchs and
outstretch'd
    heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we to th' court? fo
r, by
my
    fay, I cannot reason.
  Both. We'll wait upon you.
  Ham. No such matter! I will no
t sort you with the rest of my
    servants; for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most
  
  dreadfully attended. But in the beaten way of friendship,
what
    make you at Elsinore?
  Ros.
 To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
  Ham. Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I
 thank
you;
    and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny.
Were
    you not sen
t for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free
    visitation? Come, deal justly with me. Come, come
! Nay,
speak.
  Guil. What should we say, my lord?
  Ham. Why, anything- but to th' purpose. You 
were sent for; and
    there is a kind of confession in your looks, which your
modesties
    have
 not craft enough to colour. I know the good King and
Queen
    have sent for you.
  Ros. To what
 end, my lord?
  Ham. That you must teach me. But let me conjure you by the
rights
    of our fel
lowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the
    obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by w
hat more dear
a
    better proposer could charge you withal, be even and direct
with
    me, whe
ther you were sent for or no.
  Ros. [aside to Guildenstern] What say you?
  Ham. [aside] Nay then
, I have an eye of you.- If you love me,
hold
    not off.
  Guil. My lord, we were sent for.
  
Ham. I will tell you why. So shall my anticipation prevent your
    discovery, and your secrecy to 
the King and Queen moult no
    feather. I have of late- but wherefore I know not- lost all
my
  
  mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes
so
    heavily with my disposition t
hat this goodly frame, the
earth,
    seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy
,
the
    air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this
majestical
    roof fretted with
 golden fire- why, it appeareth no other
thing
    to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of
 vapours. What
a
    piece of work is a man! how noble in reason! how infinite in
    faculties! 
in form and moving how express and admirable! in
    action how like an angel! in apprehension how 
like a god! the
    beauty of the world, the paragon of animals! And yet to me
what
    is this q
uintessence of dust? Man delights not me- no, nor
woman
    neither, though by your smiling you se
em to say so.
  Ros. My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.
  Ham. Why did you laugh the
n, when I said 'Man delights not me'?
  Ros. To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what len
ten
    entertainment the players shall receive from you. We coted
them
    on the way, and hithe
r are they coming to offer you service.
  Ham. He that plays the king shall be welcome- his Majesty
 shall
    have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil
and
    target; the love
r shall not sigh gratis; the humorous man
shall
    end his part in peace; the clown shall make th
ose laugh whose
    lungs are tickle o' th' sere; and the lady shall say her mind
    freely, or t
he blank verse shall halt for't. What players are
    they?
  Ros. Even those you were wont to tak
e such delight in, the
    tragedians of the city.
  Ham. How chances it they travel? Their reside
nce, both in
    reputation and profit, was better both ways.
  Ros. I think their inhibition come
s by the means of the late
    innovation.
  Ham. Do they hold the same estimation they did when I
 was in
the
    city? Are they so follow'd?
  Ros. No indeed are they not.
  Ham. How comes it? 
Do they grow rusty?
  Ros. Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there
is,
    sir, 
an eyrie of children, little eyases, that cry out on the
top
    of question and are most tyrannic
ally clapp'd for't. These
are now
    the fashion, and so berattle the common stages (so they call

    them) that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goosequills and
    dare scarce come thither.

  Ham. What, are they children? Who maintains 'em? How are they
    escoted? Will they pursue the q
uality no longer than they can
    sing? Will they not say afterwards, if they should grow
    the
mselves to common players (as it is most like, if their
means
    are no better), their writers do
 them wrong to make them
exclaim
    against their own succession.
  Ros. Faith, there has been m
uch to do on both sides; and the
nation
    holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy. There wa
s, for
a
    while, no money bid for argument unless the poet and the
player
    went to cuffs i
n the question.
  Ham. Is't possible?
  Guil. O, there has been much throwing about of brains.
  
Ham. Do the boys carry it away?
  Ros. Ay, that they do, my lord- Hercules and his load too.
  Ham
. It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark,
and
    those that would make mows at h
im while my father lived give
    twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his picture
in

    little. 'Sblood, there is something in this more than
natural, if
    philosophy could find 
it out.

                     Flourish for the Players.

  Guil. There are the players.
  Ham. 
Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come!
Th'
    appurtenance of welcome is fashi
on and ceremony. Let me
comply
    with you in this garb, lest my extent to the players (which I

    tell you must show fairly outwards) should more appear like
    entertainment than yours. You a
re welcome. But my
uncle-father
    and aunt-mother are deceiv'd.
  Guil. In what, my dear lord?

  Ham. I am but mad north-north-west. When the wind is southerly
I
    know a hawk from a handsaw
.

                            Enter Polonius.

  Pol. Well be with you, gentlemen!
  Ham. Hark
 you, Guildenstern- and you too- at each ear a hearer!
    That great baby you see there is not yet
 out of his swaddling
    clouts.
  Ros. Happily he's the second time come to them; for they say a
n
old
    man is twice a child.
  Ham. I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players. Mark

it.-
   You say right, sir; a Monday morning; twas so indeed.
  Pol. My lord, I have news to tell 
you.
  Ham. My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an
actor in
    Rome-
  Pol. The 
actors are come hither, my lord.
  Ham. Buzz, buzz!
  Pol. Upon my honour-
  Ham. Then came each 
actor on his ass-
  Pol. The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy,
    history, pa
storal, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral,
    tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical
-pastoral;
scene
    individable, or poem unlimited. Seneca cannot be too heavy,
nor
    Plautus
 too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these
are
    the only men.
  Ham. O Jephthah, j
udge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
  Pol. What treasure had he, my lord?
  Ham. Why,

 
        'One fair daughter, and no more,
           The which he loved passing well.'

  Pol. [as
ide] Still on my daughter.
  Ham. Am I not i' th' right, old Jephthah?
  Pol. If you call me Jepht
hah, my lord, I have a daughter that I
    love passing well.
  Ham. Nay, that follows not.
  Pol
. What follows then, my lord?
  Ham. Why,

           'As by lot, God wot,'

 and then, you kno
w,

           'It came to pass, as most like it was.'

    The first row of the pious chanson w
ill show you more; for
look
    where my abridgment comes.

                     Enter four or f
ive Players.

    You are welcome, masters; welcome, all.- I am glad to see
thee
    well.- Welc
ome, good friends.- O, my old friend? Why, thy
face is
    valanc'd since I saw thee last. Com'st'
 thou to' beard me in
    Denmark?- What, my young lady and mistress? By'r Lady, your
    ladyship
 is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last by the
    altitude of a chopine. Pray God your voice
, like a piece of
    uncurrent gold, be not crack'd within the ring.- Masters, you
are
    all w
elcome. We'll e'en to't like French falconers, fly at
    anything we see. We'll have a speech stra
ight. Come, give us
a
    taste of your quality. Come, a passionate speech.
  1. Play. What speec
h, my good lord?
  Ham. I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never
acted;
    or if it
 was, not above once; for the play, I remember,
pleas'd
    not the million, 'twas caviary to the 
general; but it was (as
I
    receiv'd it, and others, whose judgments in such matters
cried in

    the top of mine) an excellent play, well digested in the
scenes,
    set down with as much mod
esty as cunning. I remember one said
    there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter
sav
oury,
    nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of
    affectation; but call'd 
it an honest method, as wholesome as
    sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speec
h
in't
    I chiefly lov'd. 'Twas AEneas' tale to Dido, and thereabout
of it
    especially wher
e he speaks of Priam's slaughter. If it live
in
    your memory, begin at this line- let me see, l
et me see:

         'The rugged Pyrrhus, like th' Hyrcanian beast-'

    'Tis not so; it begins
 with Pyrrhus:

         'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
         Black as his purpose,
 did the night resemble
         When he lay couched in the ominous horse,
         Hath now this 
dread and black complexion smear'd
         With heraldry more dismal. Head to foot
         Now i
s be total gules, horridly trick'd
         With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
     
    Bak'd and impasted with the parching streets,
         That lend a tyrannous and a damned light

         To their lord's murther. Roasted in wrath and fire,
         And thus o'ersized with coa
gulate gore,
         With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
         Old grandsire Priam 
seeks.'

    So, proceed you.
  Pol. Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good
 
    discretion.

  1. Play. 'Anon he finds him,
      Striking too short at Greeks. His antique s
word,
      Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
      Repugnant to command. Unequal match'
d,
      Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide;
      But with the whiff and wind of his f
ell sword
      Th' unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
      Seeming to feel this blow, 
with flaming top
      Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
      Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' 
ear. For lo! his sword,
      Which was declining on the milky head
      Of reverend Priam, seem'
d i' th' air to stick.
      So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
      And, like a neutral to 
his will and matter,
      Did nothing.
      But, as we often see, against some storm,
      A s
ilence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
      The bold winds speechless, and the orb below
  
    As hush as death- anon the dreadful thunder
      Doth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus' paus
e,
      Aroused vengeance sets him new awork;
      And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
    
  On Mars's armour, forg'd for proof eterne,
      With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword

      Now falls on Priam.
      Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods,
      In general sy
nod take away her power;
      Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
      And bowl the
 round nave down the hill of heaven,
      As low as to the fiends!

  Pol. This is too long.
  
Ham. It shall to the barber's, with your beard.- Prithee say
on.
    He's for a jig or a tale of b
awdry, or he sleeps. Say on;
come to
    Hecuba.

  1. Play. 'But who, O who, had seen the moble
d queen-'

  Ham. 'The mobled queen'?
  Pol. That's good! 'Mobled queen' is good.

  1. Play. '
Run barefoot up and down, threat'ning the flames
      With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head
 
     Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
      About her lank and all o'erteemed loins,
 
     A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up-
      Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep
'd
      'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have pronounc'd.
      But if the gods themselves d
id see her then,
      When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
      In Mincing with his sword h
er husband's limbs,
      The instant burst of clamour that she made
      (Unless things mortal m
ove them not at all)
      Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven
      And passion in t
he gods.'

  Pol. Look, whe'r he has not turn'd his colour, and has tears
in's
    eyes. Prithee
 no more!
  Ham. 'Tis well. I'll have thee speak out the rest of this
soon.-
    Good my lord, wi
ll you see the players well bestow'd? Do you
    hear? Let them be well us'd; for they are the abst
ract and
brief
    chronicles of the time. After your death you were better have
a
    bad epita
ph than their ill report while you live.
  Pol. My lord, I will use them according to their desert.

  Ham. God's bodykins, man, much better! Use every man after his
    desert, and who should scape
 whipping? Use them after your
own
    honour and dignity. The less they deserve, the more merit i
s
in
    your bounty. Take them in.
  Pol. Come, sirs.
  Ham. Follow him, friends. We'll hear a 
play to-morrow.
                 Exeunt Polonius and Players [except the First].
    Dost thou hea
r me, old friend? Can you play 'The Murther of
    Gonzago'?
  1. Play. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. We'll
 ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need, study a
    speech of some dozen or sixteen lines whi
ch I would set down
and
    insert in't, could you not?
  1. Play. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Very well
. Follow that lord- and look you mock him not.
                                            [Exit Fi
rst Player.]
    My good friends, I'll leave you till night. You are welcome
to
    Elsinore.
  
Ros. Good my lord!
  Ham. Ay, so, God b' wi' ye!
                            [Exeunt Rosencrantz a
nd Guildenstern
    Now I am alone.
    O what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
    Is it not mons
trous that this player here,
    But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
    Could force his soul
 so to his own conceit
    That, from her working, all his visage wann'd,
    Tears in his eyes, d
istraction in's aspect,
    A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
    With forms to his c
onceit? And all for nothing!
    For Hecuba!
    What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
    That 
he should weep for her? What would he do,
    Had he the motive and the cue for passion
    That I
 have? He would drown the stage with tears
    And cleave the general ear with horrid speech;
    
Make mad the guilty and appal the free,
    Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed
    The very f
aculties of eyes and ears.
    Yet I,
    A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak
    Like John-a-d
reams, unpregnant of my cause,
    And can say nothing! No, not for a king,
    Upon whose propert
y and most dear life
    A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
    Who calls me villain? breaks
 my pate across?
    Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?
    Tweaks me by th' nose? gives
 me the lie i' th' throat
    As deep as to the lungs? Who does me this, ha?
    'Swounds, I shoul
d take it! for it cannot be
    But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall
    To make oppression bitte
r, or ere this
    I should have fatted all the region kites
    With this slave's offal. Bloody b
awdy villain!
    Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
    O, vengeance!
    Wh
y, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
    That I, the son of a dear father murther'd,
    Promp
ted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
    Must (like a whore) unpack my heart with words
    And f
all a-cursing like a very drab,
    A scullion!
    Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! Hum, I have 
heard
    That guilty creatures, sitting at a play,
    Have by the very cunning of the scene
   
 Been struck so to the soul that presently
    They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
    For mu
rther, though it have no tongue, will speak
    With most miraculous organ, I'll have these Players

    Play something like the murther of my father
    Before mine uncle. I'll observe his looks;

    I'll tent him to the quick. If he but blench,
    I know my course. The spirit that I have seen

    May be a devil; and the devil hath power
    T' assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
  
  Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
    As he is very potent with such spirits,
    Abuses me 
to damn me. I'll have grounds
    More relative than this. The play's the thing
    Wherein I'll c
atch the conscience of the King.         Exit.

ACT III. Scene I.
Elsinore. A r
oom in the Castle.

Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern,
and Lords.


  King. And can you by no drift of circumstance
    Get from him why he puts on this confusion,

    Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
    With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
  Ros. He do
es confess he feels himself distracted,
    But from what cause he will by no means speak.
  Guil.
 Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
    But with a crafty madness keeps aloof
    When we w
ould bring him on to some confession
    Of his true state.
  Queen. Did he receive you well?
  R
os. Most like a gentleman.
  Guil. But with much forcing of his disposition.
  Ros. Niggard of que
stion, but of our demands
    Most free in his reply.
  Queen. Did you assay him
    To any pasti
me?
  Ros. Madam, it so fell out that certain players
    We o'erraught on the way. Of these we to
ld him,
    And there did seem in him a kind of joy
    To hear of it. They are here about the cou
rt,
    And, as I think, they have already order
    This night to play before him.
  Pol. 'Tis m
ost true;
    And he beseech'd me to entreat your Majesties
    To hear and see the matter.
  Kin
g. With all my heart, and it doth much content me
    To hear him so inclin'd.
    Good gentlemen,
 give him a further edge
    And drive his purpose on to these delights.
  Ros. We shall, my lord.

                            Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
  King. Sweet Gertrude, leave us
 too;
    For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
    That he, as 'twere by accident, may here

    Affront Ophelia.
    Her father and myself (lawful espials)
    Will so bestow ourselves tha
t, seeing unseen,
    We may of their encounter frankly judge
    And gather by him, as he is beha
v'd,
    If't be th' affliction of his love, or no,
    That thus he suffers for.
  Queen. I shal
l obey you;
    And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
    That your good beauties be the happy cau
se
    Of Hamlet's wildness. So shall I hope your virtues
    Will bring him to his wonted way aga
in,
    To both your honours.
  Oph. Madam, I wish it may.
                                      
             [Exit Queen.]
  Pol. Ophelia, walk you here.- Gracious, so please you,
    We will be
stow ourselves.- [To Ophelia] Read on this book,
    That show of such an exercise may colour
    
Your loneliness.- We are oft to blame in this,
    'Tis too much prov'd, that with devotion's visag
e
    And pious action we do sugar o'er
    The Devil himself.
  King. [aside] O, 'tis too true!

    How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
    The harlot's cheek, beautied with pl
ast'ring art,
    Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
    Than is my deed to my most paint
ed word.
    O heavy burthen!
  Pol. I hear him coming. Let's withdraw, my lord.
                
                      Exeunt King and Polonius].

                           Enter Hamlet.

  Ha
m. To be, or not to be- that is the question:
    Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
    Th
e slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
    Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
    And b
y opposing end them. To die- to sleep-
    No more; and by a sleep to say we end
    The heartache
, and the thousand natural shocks
    That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation
    Devoutly to b
e wish'd. To die- to sleep.
    To sleep- perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub!
    For in that
 sleep of death what dreams may come
    When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
    Must give
 us pause. There's the respect
    That makes calamity of so long life.
    For who would bear the
 whips and scorns of time,
    Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
    The pangs of 
despis'd love, the law's delay,
    The insolence of office, and the spurns
    That patient merit
 of th' unworthy takes,
    When he himself might his quietus make
    With a bare bodkin? Who wou
ld these fardels bear,
    To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
    But that the dread of someth
ing after death-
    The undiscover'd country, from whose bourn
    No traveller returns- puzzles 
the will,
    And makes us rather bear those ills we have
    Than fly to others that we know not 
of?
    Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
    And thus the native hue of resolution
  
  Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
    And enterprises of great pith and moment
   
 With this regard their currents turn awry
    And lose the name of action.- Soft you now!
    The
 fair Ophelia!- Nymph, in thy orisons
    Be all my sins rememb'red.
  Oph. Good my lord,
    How
 does your honour for this many a day?
  Ham. I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
  Oph. My lord
, I have remembrances of yours
    That I have longed long to re-deliver.
    I pray you, now rece
ive them.
  Ham. No, not I!
    I never gave you aught.
  Oph. My honour'd lord, you know right w
ell you did,
    And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd
    As made the things more rich.
 Their perfume lost,
    Take these again; for to the noble mind
    Rich gifts wax poor when give
rs prove unkind.
    There, my lord.
  Ham. Ha, ha! Are you honest?
  Oph. My lord?
  Ham. Are y
ou fair?
  Oph. What means your lordship?
  Ham. That if you be honest and fair, your honesty shou
ld admit
no
    discourse to your beauty.
  Oph. Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than
 with
honesty?
  Ham. Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform
    honesty from w
hat it is to a bawd than the force of honesty
can
    translate beauty into his likeness. This was
 sometime a
paradox,
    but now the time gives it proof. I did love you once.
  Oph. Indeed, my 
lord, you made me believe so.
  Ham. You should not have believ'd me; for virtue cannot so
    ino
culate our old stock but we shall relish of it. I loved
you
    not.
  Oph. I was the more deceiv
ed.
  Ham. Get thee to a nunnery! Why wouldst thou be a breeder of
    sinners? I am myself indiff
erent honest, but yet I could
accuse
    me of such things that it were better my mother had not b
orne
me.
    I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more offences at
my
    beck than I ha
ve thoughts to put them in, imagination to give
    them shape, or time to act them in. What should
 such fellows
as I
    do, crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves
all;
    beli
eve none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where's your
    father?
  Oph. At home, my lord.
  Ham
. Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool
    nowhere but in's own house. Farewel
l.
  Oph. O, help him, you sweet heavens!
  Ham. If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague fo
r thy
dowry:
    be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not
escape
    calumny. G
et thee to a nunnery. Go, farewell. Or if thou wilt
    needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men kno
w well enough what
    monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go; and quickly too.
    Farewell.

  Oph. O heavenly powers, restore him!
  Ham. I have heard of your paintings too, well enough. Go
d hath
    given you one face, and you make yourselves another. You jig,
you
    amble, and you l
isp; you nickname God's creatures and make
your
    wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more
 on't! it hath
made
    me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages. Those that are
    married
 already- all but one- shall live; the rest shall keep
as
    they are. To a nunnery, go.         
                   Exit.
  Oph. O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
    The courtier's, schol
ar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword,
    Th' expectancy and rose of the fair state,
    The glass 
of fashion and the mould of form,
    Th' observ'd of all observers- quite, quite down!
    And I,
 of ladies most deject and wretched,
    That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
    Now see that
 noble and most sovereign reason,
    Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
    That un
match'd form and feature of blown youth
    Blasted with ecstasy. O, woe is me
    T' have seen wh
at I have seen, see what I see!

                   Enter King and Polonius.

  King. Love? his 
affections do not that way tend;
    Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,
    Was no
t like madness. There's something in his soul
    O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
    And
 I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
    Will be some danger; which for to prevent,
    I have i
n quick determination
    Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England
    For the demand of o
ur neglected tribute.
    Haply the seas, and countries different,
    With variable objects, shal
l expel
    This something-settled matter in his heart,
    Whereon his brains still beating puts 
him thus
    From fashion of himself. What think you on't?
  Pol. It shall do well. But yet do I b
elieve
    The origin and commencement of his grief
    Sprung from neglected love.- How now, Ophe
lia?
    You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said.
    We heard it all.- My lord, do as you plea
se;
    But if you hold it fit, after the play
    Let his queen mother all alone entreat him
   
 To show his grief. Let her be round with him;
    And I'll be plac'd so please you, in the ear
  
  Of all their conference. If she find him not,
    To England send him; or confine him where
    
Your wisdom best shall think.
  King. It shall be so.
    Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd
 go.         Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. hall in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet and three of 
the Players.

  Ham. Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounc'd it to you,
    trippingly on t
he tongue. But if you mouth it, as many of our
    players do, I had as live the town crier spoke m
y lines. Nor
do
    not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all
    gently; for in
 the very torrent, tempest, and (as I may say)
    whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and 
beget a
    temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to
the
    soul to hear a ro
bustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion
to
    tatters, to very rags, to split the cars of th
e groundlings,
who
    (for the most part) are capable of nothing but inexplicable
dumb
    show
s and noise. I would have such a fellow whipp'd for
o'erdoing
    Termagant. It out-herods Herod. 
Pray you avoid it.
  Player. I warrant your honour.
  Ham. Be not too tame neither; but let your o
wn discretion be
your
    tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the action;
with
    t
his special observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of
    nature: for anything so overdone i
s from the purpose of
playing,
    whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as

    'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show Virtue her own
feature,
    scorn her own image, and 
the very age and body of the time
his
    form and pressure. Now this overdone, or come tardy off,

though
    it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious
    grieve; the censure of
 the which one must in your allowance
    o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players 
that
I
    have seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly (not
to
    speak it profane
ly), that, neither having the accent of
    Christians, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, 
have
so
    strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of Nature's
    journeymen had made me
n, and not made them well, they
imitated
    humanity so abominably.
  Player. I hope we have ref
orm'd that indifferently with us,
sir.
  Ham. O, reform it altogether! And let those that play you
r
clowns
    speak no more than is set down for them. For there be of them
    that will themselv
es laugh, to set on some quantity of barren
    spectators to laugh too, though in the mean time so
me
necessary
    question of the play be then to be considered. That's
villanous
    and shows a
 most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it.
Go
    make you ready.
                         
                        Exeunt Players.

            Enter Polonius, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern
.

    How now, my lord? Will the King hear this piece of work?
  Pol. And the Queen too, and tha
t presently.
  Ham. Bid the players make haste, [Exit Polonius.] Will you two
    help to hasten t
hem?
  Both. We will, my lord.                       Exeunt they two.
  Ham. What, ho, Horatio!


                      Enter Horatio.

  Hor. Here, sweet lord, at your service.
  Ham. Horatio, 
thou art e'en as just a man
    As e'er my conversation cop'd withal.
  Hor. O, my dear lord!
  H
am. Nay, do not think I flatter;
    For what advancement may I hope from thee,
    That no revenu
e hast but thy good spirits
    To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
    No,
 let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
    And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
    Where 
thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
    Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
    A
nd could of men distinguish, her election
    Hath seal'd thee for herself. For thou hast been
   
 As one, in suff'ring all, that suffers nothing;
    A man that Fortune's buffets and rewards
    
Hast ta'en with equal thanks; and blest are those
    Whose blood and judgment are so well commingl
ed
    That they are not a pipe for Fortune's finger
    To sound what stop she please. Give me th
at man
    That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
    In my heart's core, ay, in my hear
t of heart,
    As I do thee. Something too much of this I
    There is a play to-night before the
 King.
    One scene of it comes near the circumstance,
    Which I have told thee, of my father's
 death.
    I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
    Even with the very comment of thy soul

    Observe my uncle. If his occulted guilt
    Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
    It is a
 damned ghost that we have seen,
    And my imaginations are as foul
    As Vulcan's stithy. Give 
him heedful note;
    For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,
    And after we will both our judgm
ents join
    In censure of his seeming.
  Hor. Well, my lord.
    If he steal aught the whilst t
his play is playing,
    And scape detecting, I will pay the theft.

    Sound a flourish. [Enter
 Trumpets and Kettledrums. Danish
    march. [Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz,
 
     Guildenstern, and other Lords attendant, with the Guard
                       carrying torche
s.

  Ham. They are coming to the play. I must be idle.
    Get you a place.
  King. How fares o
ur cousin Hamlet?
  Ham. Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish. I eat the
air,
    promise
-cramm'd. You cannot feed capons so.
  King. I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet. These words a
re
not
    mine.
  Ham. No, nor mine now. [To Polonius] My lord, you play'd once
    i' th' univ
ersity, you say?
  Pol. That did I, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.
  Ham. What did you e
nact?
  Pol. I did enact Julius Caesar; I was kill'd i' th' Capitol;
Brutus
    kill'd me.
  Ham
. It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf
there. Be
    the players ready.
  Ros. Ay
, my lord. They stay upon your patience.
  Queen. Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
  Ham. N
o, good mother. Here's metal more attractive.
  Pol. [to the King] O, ho! do you mark that?
  Ham.
 Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
                                  [Sits down at Ophelia's feet.]


  Oph. No, my lord.
  Ham. I mean, my head upon your lap?
  Oph. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Do you thin
k I meant country matters?
  Oph. I think nothing, my lord.
  Ham. That's a fair thought to lie be
tween maids' legs.
  Oph. What is, my lord?
  Ham. Nothing.
  Oph. You are merry, my lord.
  Ham
. Who, I?
  Oph. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. O God, your only jig-maker! What should a man do but be
merr
y?
    For look you how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father
died
    within 's two hours.

  Oph. Nay 'tis twice two months, my lord.
  Ham. So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for 
I'll have
a
    suit of sables. O heavens! die two months ago, and not
forgotten
    yet? Then t
here's hope a great man's memory may outlive his
life
    half a year. But, by'r Lady, he must bui
ld churches then; or
else
    shall he suffer not thinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose

    
epitaph is 'For O, for O, the hobby-horse is forgot!'

               Hautboys play. The dumb show
 enters.

    Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing
    him and he her. She
 kneels, and makes show of protestation
    unto him. He takes her up, and declines his head upon h
er
    neck. He lays him down upon a bank of flowers. She, seeing
    him asleep, leaves him. Anon
 comes in a fellow, takes off his
    crown, kisses it, pours poison in the sleeper's ears, and
  
  leaves him. The Queen returns, finds the King dead, and makes
    passionate action. The Poisoner
 with some three or four
Mutes,
    comes in again, seem to condole with her. The dead body is
  
  carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with gifts; she
    seems harsh and unwilling awhile, 
but in the end accepts
    his love.
                                                         Exeu
nt.

  Oph. What means this, my lord?
  Ham. Marry, this is miching malhecho; it means mischief.

  Oph. Belike this show imports the argument of the play.

                      Enter Prologue.


  Ham. We shall know by this fellow. The players cannot keep
counsel;
    they'll tell all.
  
Oph. Will he tell us what this show meant?
  Ham. Ay, or any show that you'll show him. Be not you 
asham'd
to
    show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means.
  Oph. You are naught, you are na
ught! I'll mark the play.

    Pro. For us, and for our tragedy,
      Here stooping to your clem
ency,
      We beg your hearing patiently.                     [Exit.]

  Ham. Is this a prologue
, or the posy of a ring?
  Oph. 'Tis brief, my lord.
  Ham. As woman's love.

              Ente
r [two Players as] King and Queen.

    King. Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round
   
   Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
      And thirty dozen moons with borrowed sheen

      About the world have times twelve thirties been,
      Since love our hearts, and Hymen did o
ur hands,
      Unite comutual in most sacred bands.
    Queen. So many journeys may the sun and m
oon
      Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
      But woe is me! you are so sick of late,

      So far from cheer and from your former state.
      That I distrust you. Yet, though I dist
rust,
      Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must;
      For women's fear and love holds quanti
ty,
      In neither aught, or in extremity.
      Now what my love is, proof hath made you know;

      And as my love is siz'd, my fear is so.
      Where love is great, the littlest doubts are f
ear;
      Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.
    King. Faith, I must leave th
ee, love, and shortly too;
      My operant powers their functions leave to do.
      And thou sha
lt live in this fair world behind,
      Honour'd, belov'd, and haply one as kind
      For husban
d shalt thou-
    Queen. O, confound the rest!
      Such love must needs be treason in my breast.

      When second husband let me be accurst!
      None wed the second but who killed the first.


  Ham. [aside] Wormwood, wormwood!

    Queen. The instances that second marriage move
      A
re base respects of thrift, but none of love.
      A second time I kill my husband dead
      Whe
n second husband kisses me in bed.
    King. I do believe you think what now you speak;
      But 
what we do determine oft we break.
      Purpose is but the slave to memory,
      Of violent birt
h, but poor validity;
      Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree,
      But fall unsha
ken when they mellow be.
      Most necessary 'tis that we forget
      To pay ourselves what to o
urselves is debt.
      What to ourselves in passion we propose,
      The passion ending, doth th
e purpose lose.
      The violence of either grief or joy
      Their own enactures with themselve
s destroy.
      Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
      Grief joys, joy grieves, on 
slender accident.
      This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
      That even our loves 
should with our fortunes change;
      For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
      Whether lov
e lead fortune, or else fortune love.
      The great man down, you mark his favourite flies,
    
  The poor advanc'd makes friends of enemies;
      And hitherto doth love on fortune tend,
      
For who not needs shall never lack a friend,
      And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
     
 Directly seasons him his enemy.
      But, orderly to end where I begun,
      Our wills and fate
s do so contrary run
      That our devices still are overthrown;
      Our thoughts are ours, the
ir ends none of our own.
      So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
      But die thy thought
s when thy first lord is dead.
    Queen. Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light,
      Sport
 and repose lock from me day and night,
      To desperation turn my trust and hope,
      An anch
or's cheer in prison be my scope,
      Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
      Meet what 
I would have well, and it destroy,
      Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
      If, o
nce a widow, ever I be wife!

  Ham. If she should break it now!

    King. 'Tis deeply sworn. S
weet, leave me here awhile.
      My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile
      The tedious
 day with sleep.
    Queen. Sleep rock thy brain,
                                                
    [He] sleeps.
      And never come mischance between us twain!
Exit.

  Ham. Madam, how like 
you this play?
  Queen. The lady doth protest too much, methinks.
  Ham. O, but she'll keep her wo
rd.
  King. Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in't?
  Ham. No, no! They do but jest
, poison in jest; no offence i'
th'
    world.
  King. What do you call the play?
  Ham. 'The Mo
usetrap.' Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the
    image of a murther done in Vienna. Gonzago i
s the duke's
name;
    his wife, Baptista. You shall see anon. 'Tis a knavish piece
of
    work;
 but what o' that? Your Majesty, and we that have free
    souls, it touches us not. Let the gall'd
 jade winch; our
withers
    are unwrung.

                         Enter Lucianus.

    This 
is one Lucianus, nephew to the King.
  Oph. You are as good as a chorus, my lord.
  Ham. I could i
nterpret between you and your love, if I could
see
    the puppets dallying.
  Oph. You are keen,
 my lord, you are keen.
  Ham. It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
  Oph. Still bett
er, and worse.
  Ham. So you must take your husbands.- Begin, murtherer. Pox,
leave
    thy damna
ble faces, and begin! Come, the croaking raven doth
    bellow for revenge.

    Luc. Thoughts bl
ack, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
      Confederate season, else no creature seeing;
 
     Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,
      With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice
 infected,
      Thy natural magic and dire property
      On wholesome life usurp immediately.
 
                                  Pours the poison in his ears.

  Ham. He poisons him i' th' gard
en for's estate. His name's
Gonzago.
    The story is extant, and written in very choice Italian. 
You
    shall see anon how the murtherer gets the love of Gonzago's
wife.
  Oph. The King rises.

  Ham. What, frighted with false fire?
  Queen. How fares my lord?
  Pol. Give o'er the play.
  
King. Give me some light! Away!
  All. Lights, lights, lights!
                              Exeun
t all but Hamlet and Horatio.
  Ham.   Why, let the strucken deer go weep,
          The hart unga
lled play;
         For some must watch, while some must sleep:
          Thus runs the world away
.
    Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers- if the rest of
my
    fortunes turn Turk wit
h me-with two Provincial roses on my
raz'd
    shoes, get me a fellowship in a cry of players, sir
?
  Hor. Half a share.
  Ham.   A whole one I!
         For thou dost know, O Damon dear,
      
     This realm dismantled was
         Of Jove himself; and now reigns here
           A very, ve
ry- pajock.
  Hor. You might have rhym'd.
  Ham. O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a 
thousand
    pound! Didst perceive?
  Hor. Very well, my lord.
  Ham. Upon the talk of the poison
ing?
  Hor. I did very well note him.
  Ham.   Aha! Come, some music! Come, the recorders!
      
   For if the King like not the comedy,
         Why then, belike he likes it not, perdy.
    Come
, some music!

                Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Guil. Good my lord, vouchs
afe me a word with you.
  Ham. Sir, a whole history.
  Guil. The King, sir-
  Ham. Ay, sir, what 
of him?
  Guil. Is in his retirement, marvellous distemper'd.
  Ham. With drink, sir?
  Guil. No,
 my lord; rather with choler.
  Ham. Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this
to

    the doctor; for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps
    plunge him into far more cho
ler.
  Guil. Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame, and
start
    not so wildly from m
y affair.
  Ham. I am tame, sir; pronounce.
  Guil. The Queen, your mother, in most great afflicti
on of
spirit
    hath sent me to you.
  Ham. You are welcome.
  Guil. Nay, good my lord, this co
urtesy is not of the right
breed.
    If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, I will

do
    your mother's commandment; if not, your pardon and my return
    shall be the end of my b
usiness.
  Ham. Sir, I cannot.
  Guil. What, my lord?
  Ham. Make you a wholesome answer; my wit'
s diseas'd. But, sir,
such
    answer as I can make, you shall command; or rather, as you
say,
 
   my mother. Therefore no more, but to the matter! My mother,
you
    say-
  Ros. Then thus she 
says: your behaviour hath struck her into
    amazement and admiration.
  Ham. O wonderful son, th
at can so stonish a mother! But is
there no
    sequel at the heels of this mother's admiration? I
mpart.
  Ros. She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to
bed.
  Ham. We shall obey
, were she ten times our mother. Have you any
    further trade with us?
  Ros. My lord, you once 
did love me.
  Ham. And do still, by these pickers and stealers!
  Ros. Good my lord, what is your
 cause of distemper? You do
surely
    bar the door upon your own liberty, if you deny your griefs

to
    your friend.
  Ham. Sir, I lack advancement.
  Ros. How can that be, when you have the v
oice of the King
himself
    for your succession in Denmark?
  Ham. Ay, sir, but 'while the grass
 grows'- the proverb is
something
    musty.

                     Enter the Players with record
ers.

    O, the recorders! Let me see one. To withdraw with you- why
do
    you go about to rec
over the wind of me, as if you would drive
me
    into a toil?
  Guil. O my lord, if my duty be t
oo bold, my love is too
unmannerly.
  Ham. I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this

pipe?
  Guil. My lord, I cannot.
  Ham. I pray you.
  Guil. Believe me, I cannot.
  Ham. I do b
eseech you.
  Guil. I know, no touch of it, my lord.
  Ham. It is as easy as lying. Govern these v
entages with your
    fingers and thumbs, give it breath with your mouth, and it
will
    discour
se most eloquent music. Look you, these are the stops.
  Guil. But these cannot I command to any ut
t'rance of harmony. I
    have not the skill.
  Ham. Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you m
ake of me!
You
    would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you
would
    pluck out 
the heart of my mystery; you would sound me from my
    lowest note to the top of my compass; and t
here is much
music,
    excellent voice, in this little organ, yet cannot you make it
    speak. 
'Sblood, do you think I am easier to be play'd on than
a
    pipe? Call me what instrument you wil
l, though you can fret
me,
    you cannot play upon me.

                        Enter Polonius.


    God bless you, sir!
  Pol. My lord, the Queen would speak with you, and presently.
  Ham. 
Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
  Pol. By th' mass, and 'tis like a came
l indeed.
  Ham. Methinks it is like a weasel.
  Pol. It is back'd like a weasel.
  Ham. Or like 
a whale.
  Pol. Very like a whale.
  Ham. Then will I come to my mother by-and-by.- They fool me t
o
the
    top of my bent.- I will come by-and-by.
  Pol. I will say so.                          
            Exit.
  Ham. 'By-and-by' is easily said.- Leave me, friends.
                         
               [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]

    'Tis now the very witching time of night,
    When c
hurchyards yawn, and hell itself breathes out
    Contagion to this world. Now could I drink hot bl
ood
    And do such bitter business as the day
    Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother!

    O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever
    The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom.
    L
et me be cruel, not unnatural;
    I will speak daggers to her, but use none.
    My tongue and so
ul in this be hypocrites-
    How in my words somever she be shent,
    To give them seals never, 
my soul, consent!             Exit.




Scene III.
A room in the Castle.

Enter King, Rosenc
rantz, and Guildenstern.

  King. I like him not, nor stands it safe with us
    To let his madne
ss range. Therefore prepare you;
    I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
    And he to Engl
and shall along with you.
    The terms of our estate may not endure
    Hazard so near us as doth
 hourly grow
    Out of his lunacies.
  Guil. We will ourselves provide.
    Most holy and religi
ous fear it is
    To keep those many many bodies safe
    That live and feed upon your Majesty.

  Ros. The single and peculiar life is bound
    With all the strength and armour of the mind
    
To keep itself from noyance; but much more
    That spirit upon whose weal depends and rests
    T
he lives of many. The cesse of majesty
    Dies not alone, but like a gulf doth draw
    What's ne
ar it with it. It is a massy wheel,
    Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,
    To whose hug
e spokes ten thousand lesser things
    Are mortis'd and adjoin'd; which when it falls,
    Each s
mall annexment, petty consequence,
    Attends the boist'rous ruin. Never alone
    Did the king s
igh, but with a general groan.
  King. Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;
    For we will
 fetters put upon this fear,
    Which now goes too free-footed.
  Both. We will haste us.
      
                                         Exeunt Gentlemen.

                   Enter Polonius.


  Pol. My lord, he's going to his mother's closet.
    Behind the arras I'll convey myself
    To 
hear the process. I'll warrant she'll tax him home;
    And, as you said, and wisely was it said,

    'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,
    Since nature makes them partial, should o'
erhear
    The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege.
    I'll call upon you ere you go to b
ed
    And tell you what I know.
  King. Thanks, dear my lord.
                                  
              Exit [Polonius].
    O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven;
    It hath the pri
mal eldest curse upon't,
    A brother's murther! Pray can I not,
    Though inclination be as sha
rp as will.
    My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent,
    And, like a man to double business
 bound,
    I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
    And both neglect. What if this cursed 
hand
    Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,
    Is there not rain enough in the sweet 
heavens
    To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
    But to confront the visage of offen
ce?
    And what's in prayer but this twofold force,
    To be forestalled ere we come to fall,
 
   Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;
    My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer
  
  Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murther'?
    That cannot be; since I am still possess'd

    Of those effects for which I did the murther-
    My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.
 
   May one be pardon'd and retain th' offence?
    In the corrupted currents of this world
    Off
ence's gilded hand may shove by justice,
    And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
    Buys ou
t the law; but 'tis not so above.
    There is no shuffling; there the action lies
    In his true
 nature, and we ourselves compell'd,
    Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
    To give
 in evidence. What then? What rests?
    Try what repentance can. What can it not?
    Yet what ca
n it when one cannot repent?
    O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
    O limed soul, that,
 struggling to be free,
    Art more engag'd! Help, angels! Make assay.
    Bow, stubborn knees; a
nd heart with strings of steel,
    Be soft as sinews of the new-born babe!
    All may be well.  
                                He kneels.

                         Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Now m
ight I do it pat, now he is praying;
    And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven,
    And so a
m I reveng'd. That would be scann'd.
    A villain kills my father; and for that,
    I, his sole 
son, do this same villain send
    To heaven.
    Why, this is hire and salary, not revenge!
    
He took my father grossly, full of bread,
    With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
  
  And how his audit stands, who knows save heaven?
    But in our circumstance and course of though
t,
    'Tis heavy with him; and am I then reveng'd,
    To take him in the purging of his soul,
 
   When he is fit and seasoned for his passage?
    No.
    Up, sword, and know thou a more horrid
 hent.
    When he is drunk asleep; or in his rage;
    Or in th' incestuous pleasure of his bed;

    At gaming, swearing, or about some act
    That has no relish of salvation in't-
    Then tri
p him, that his heels may kick at heaven,
    And that his soul may be as damn'd and black
    As 
hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays.
    This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.              
Exit.
  King. [rises] My words fly up, my thoughts remain below.
    Words without thoughts never 
to heaven go.             Exit.




Scene IV.
The Queen's closet.

Enter Queen and Polonius.


  Pol. He will come straight. Look you lay home to him.
    Tell him his pranks have been too b
road to bear with,
    And that your Grace hath screen'd and stood between
    Much heat and him. 
I'll silence me even here.
    Pray you be round with him.
  Ham. (within) Mother, mother, mother!

  Queen. I'll warrant you; fear me not. Withdraw; I hear him
coming.
                           
   [Polonius hides behind the arras.]

                          Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Now, moth
er, what's the matter?
  Queen. Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
  Ham. Mother, you hav
e my father much offended.
  Queen. Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
  Ham. Go, go, you
 question with a wicked tongue.
  Queen. Why, how now, Hamlet?
  Ham. What's the matter now?
  Qu
een. Have you forgot me?
  Ham. No, by the rood, not so!
    You are the Queen, your husband's bro
ther's wife,
    And (would it were not so!) you are my mother.
  Queen. Nay, then I'll set those 
to you that can speak.
  Ham. Come, come, and sit you down. You shall not budge;
    You go not ti
ll I set you up a glass
    Where you may see the inmost part of you.
  Queen. What wilt thou do? 
Thou wilt not murther me?
    Help, help, ho!
  Pol. [behind] What, ho! help, help, help!
  Ham. 
[draws] How now? a rat? Dead for a ducat, dead!
            [Makes a pass through the arras and] ki
lls Polonius.
  Pol. [behind] O, I am slain!
  Queen. O me, what hast thou done?
  Ham. Nay, I kn
ow not. Is it the King?
  Queen. O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
  Ham. A bloody deed- alm
ost as bad, good mother,
    As kill a king, and marry with his brother.
  Queen. As kill a king?

  Ham. Ay, lady, it was my word.
                         [Lifts up the arras and sees Polonius.]

    Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
    I took thee for thy better. Take thy fortun
e.
    Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.
    Leave wringing of your hands. Peace! sit yo
u down
    And let me wring your heart; for so I shall
    If it be made of penetrable stuff;
   
 If damned custom have not braz'd it so
    That it is proof and bulwark against sense.
  Queen. W
hat have I done that thou dar'st wag thy tongue
    In noise so rude against me?
  Ham. Such an ac
t
    That blurs the grace and blush of modesty;
    Calls virtue hypocrite; takes off the rose
 
   From the fair forehead of an innocent love,
    And sets a blister there; makes marriage vows
 
   As false as dicers' oaths. O, such a deed
    As from the body of contraction plucks
    The ve
ry soul, and sweet religion makes
    A rhapsody of words! Heaven's face doth glow;
    Yea, this 
solidity and compound mass,
    With tristful visage, as against the doom,
    Is thought-sick at 
the act.
  Queen. Ah me, what act,
    That roars so loud and thunders in the index?
  Ham. Look 
here upon th's picture, and on this,
    The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
    See what
 a grace was seated on this brow;
    Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
    An eye like
 Mars, to threaten and command;
    A station like the herald Mercury
    New lighted on a heaven-
kissing hill:
    A combination and a form indeed
    Where every god did seem to set his seal
  
  To give the world assurance of a man.
    This was your husband. Look you now what follows.
    
Here is your husband, like a mildew'd ear
    Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
    C
ould you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
    And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes
    Y
ou cannot call it love; for at your age
    The heyday in the blood is tame, it's humble,
    And 
waits upon the judgment; and what judgment
    Would step from this to this? Sense sure you have,

    Else could you not have motion; but sure that sense
    Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err
,
    Nor sense to ecstacy was ne'er so thrall'd
    But it reserv'd some quantity of choice
    
To serve in such a difference. What devil was't
    That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
 
   Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
    Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,

    Or but a sickly part of one true sense
    Could not so mope.
    O shame! where is thy blush
? Rebellious hell,
    If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
    To flaming youth let virtue b
e as wax
    And melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame
    When the compulsive ardour gives the 
charge,
    Since frost itself as actively doth burn,
    And reason panders will.
  Queen. O Ham
let, speak no more!
    Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul,
    And there I see such black a
nd grained spots
    As will not leave their tinct.
  Ham. Nay, but to live
    In the rank sweat
 of an enseamed bed,
    Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love
    Over the nasty sty!
 
 Queen. O, speak to me no more!
    These words like daggers enter in mine ears.
    No more, swee
t Hamlet!
  Ham. A murtherer and a villain!
    A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
    
Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
    A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
    That from 
a shelf the precious diadem stole
    And put it in his pocket!
  Queen. No more!

             
   Enter the Ghost in his nightgown.

  Ham. A king of shreds and patches!-
    Save me and hover
 o'er me with your wings,
    You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?
  Queen. Alas,
 he's mad!
  Ham. Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
    That, laps'd in time and passion, l
ets go by
    Th' important acting of your dread command?
    O, say!
  Ghost. Do not forget. Thi
s visitation
    Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
    But look, amazement on thy mother 
sits.
    O, step between her and her fighting soul
    Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works.

    Speak to her, Hamlet.
  Ham. How is it with you, lady?
  Queen. Alas, how is't with you,
  
  That you do bend your eye on vacancy,
    And with th' encorporal air do hold discourse?
    For
th at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
    And, as the sleeping soldiers in th' alarm,
    Your
 bedded hairs, like life in excrements,
    Start up and stand an end. O gentle son,
    Upon the 
heat and flame of thy distemper
    Sprinkle cool patience! Whereon do you look?
  Ham. On him, on
 him! Look you how pale he glares!
    His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
    Woul
d make them capable.- Do not look upon me,
    Lest with this piteous action you convert
    My st
ern effects. Then what I have to do
    Will want true colour- tears perchance for blood.
  Queen.
 To whom do you speak this?
  Ham. Do you see nothing there?
  Queen. Nothing at all; yet all that
 is I see.
  Ham. Nor did you nothing hear?
  Queen. No, nothing but ourselves.
  Ham. Why, look 
you there! Look how it steals away!
    My father, in his habit as he liv'd!
    Look where he goe
s even now out at the portal!
                                                     Exit Ghost.
  Q
ueen. This is the very coinage of your brain.
    This bodiless creation ecstasy
    Is very cunni
ng in.
  Ham. Ecstasy?
    My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time
    And makes as healthfu
l music. It is not madness
    That I have utt'red. Bring me to the test,
    And I the matter wil
l reword; which madness
    Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
    Lay not that flatter
ing unction to your soul
    That not your trespass but my madness speaks.
    It will but skin an
d film the ulcerous place,
    Whiles rank corruption, mining all within,
    Infects unseen. Conf
ess yourself to heaven;
    Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
    And do not spread the c
ompost on the weeds
    To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;
    For in the fatness of 
these pursy times
    Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg-
    Yea, curb and woo for leave to do
 him good.
  Queen. O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
  Ham. O, throw away the worser p
art of it,
    And live the purer with the other half,
    Good night- but go not to my uncle's be
d.
    Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
    That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat
    
Of habits evil, is angel yet in this,
    That to the use of actions fair and good
    He likewise
 gives a frock or livery,
    That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,
    And that shall lend a ki
nd of easiness
    To the next abstinence; the next more easy;
    For use almost can change the s
tamp of nature,
    And either [master] the devil, or throw him out
    With wondrous potency. Onc
e more, good night;
    And when you are desirous to be blest,
    I'll blessing beg of you.- For 
this same lord,
    I do repent; but heaven hath pleas'd it so,
    To punish me with this, and th
is with me,
    That I must be their scourge and minister.
    I will bestow him, and will answer 
well
    The death I gave him. So again, good night.
    I must be cruel, only to be kind;
    Th
us bad begins, and worse remains behind.
    One word more, good lady.
  Queen. What shall I do?

  Ham. Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
    Let the bloat King tempt you again to bed;
  
  Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
    And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
  
  Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,
    Make you to ravel all this matter out,
   
 That I essentially am not in madness,
    But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;
    For
 who that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
    Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib
    Such d
ear concernings hide? Who would do so?
    No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
    Unpeg the bask
et on the house's top,
    Let the birds fly, and like the famous ape,
    To try conclusions, in 
the basket creep
    And break your own neck down.
  Queen. Be thou assur'd, if words be made of b
reath,
    And breath of life, I have no life to breathe
    What thou hast said to me.
  Ham. I 
must to England; you know that?
  Queen. Alack,
    I had forgot! 'Tis so concluded on.
  Ham. Th
ere's letters seal'd; and my two schoolfellows,
    Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,
   
 They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way
    And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
    For
 'tis the sport to have the enginer
    Hoist with his own petar; and 't shall go hard
    But I w
ill delve one yard below their mines
    And blow them at the moon. O, 'tis most sweet
    When in
 one line two crafts directly meet.
    This man shall set me packing.
    I'll lug the guts into 
the neighbour room.-
    Mother, good night.- Indeed, this counsellor
    Is now most still, most 
secret, and most grave,
    Who was in life a foolish peating knave.
    Come, sir, to draw toward
 an end with you.
    Good night, mother.
                  [Exit the Queen. Then] Exit Hamlet, tu
gging in
                                                       Polonius.

ACT 
IV. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King and Queen, with Rosencrantz and Guildens
tern.

  King. There's matter in these sighs. These profound heaves
    You must translate; 'tis 
fit we understand them.
    Where is your son?
  Queen. Bestow this place on us a little while.
 
                         [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
    Ah, mine own lord, what have I 
seen to-night!
  King. What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
  Queen. Mad as the sea and wind when both
 contend
    Which is the mightier. In his lawless fit
    Behind the arras hearing something stir
,
    Whips out his rapier, cries 'A rat, a rat!'
    And in this brainish apprehension kills
   
 The unseen good old man.
  King. O heavy deed!
    It had been so with us, had we been there.
  
  His liberty is full of threats to all-
    To you yourself, to us, to every one.
    Alas, how s
hall this bloody deed be answer'd?
    It will be laid to us, whose providence
    Should have kep
t short, restrain'd, and out of haunt
    This mad young man. But so much was our love
    We woul
d not understand what was most fit,
    But, like the owner of a foul disease,
    To keep it from
 divulging, let it feed
    Even on the pith of life. Where is he gone?
  Queen. To draw apart the
 body he hath kill'd;
    O'er whom his very madness, like some ore
    Among a mineral of metals 
base,
    Shows itself pure. He weeps for what is done.
  King. O Gertrude, come away!
    The su
n no sooner shall the mountains touch
    But we will ship him hence; and this vile deed
    We mu
st with all our majesty and skill
    Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!

           
  Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

    Friends both, go join you with some further aid.
    H
amlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
    And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him.
    Go
 seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body
    Into the chapel. I pray you haste in this.
     
                     Exeunt [Rosencrantz and Guildenstern].
    Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our w
isest friends
    And let them know both what we mean to do
    And what's untimely done. [So hapl
y slander-]
    Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter,
    As level as the cannon to his blank,

    Transports his poisoned shot- may miss our name
    And hit the woundless air.- O, come away!

    My soul is full of discord and dismay.
                                                       
  Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A passage in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Safely s
tow'd.
  Gentlemen. (within) Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!
  Ham. But soft! What noise? Who calls on Hamlet
? O, here they
come.

               Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Ros. What have you 
done, my lord, with the dead body?
  Ham. Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
  Ros. Tell u
s where 'tis, that we may take it thence
    And bear it to the chapel.
  Ham. Do not believe it.

  Ros. Believe what?
  Ham. That I can keep your counsel, and not mine own. Besides,
to be
    d
emanded of a sponge, what replication should be made by the
son
    of a king?
  Ros. Take you me
 for a sponge, my lord?
  Ham. Ay, sir; that soaks up the King's countenance, his
rewards,
    hi
s authorities. But such officers do the King best service
in
    the end. He keeps them, like an a
pe, in the corner of his
jaw;
    first mouth'd, to be last swallowed. When he needs what you
hav
e
    glean'd, it is but squeezing you and, sponge, you shall be
dry
    again.
  Ros. I underst
and you not, my lord.
  Ham. I am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.
  Ros. My 
lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us
to
    the King.
  Ham. The body is with 
the King, but the King is not with the
body.
    The King is a thing-
  Guil. A thing, my lord?

  Ham. Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.
                                      
                   Exeunt.




Scene III.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King.

  
King. I have sent to seek him and to find the body.
    How dangerous is it that this man goes loos
e!
    Yet must not we put the strong law on him.
    He's lov'd of the distracted multitude,
   
 Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;
    And where 'tis so, th' offender's scourge is w
eigh'd,
    But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,
    This sudden sending him away m
ust seem
    Deliberate pause. Diseases desperate grown
    By desperate appliance are reliev'd,

    Or not at all.

                    Enter Rosencrantz.

    How now O What hath befall'n?
 
 Ros. Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
    We cannot get from him.
  King. But where is h
e?
  Ros. Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
  King. Bring him before us.
  Ros. H
o, Guildenstern! Bring in my lord.

        Enter Hamlet and Guildenstern [with Attendants].

  
King. Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
  Ham. At supper.
  King. At supper? Where?
  Ham. Not where
 he eats, but where he is eaten. A certain
    convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your w
orm is
your
    only emperor for diet. We fat all creatures else to fat us,
and
    we fat ourse
lves for maggots. Your fat king and your lean
beggar
    is but variable service- two dishes, but 
to one table. That's
the
    end.
  King. Alas, alas!
  Ham. A man may fish with the worm that h
ath eat of a king, and
eat
    of the fish that hath fed of that worm.
  King. What dost thou mea
n by this?
  Ham. Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress
through
    the guts of a 
beggar.
  King. Where is Polonius?
  Ham. In heaven. Send thither to see. If your messenger find h
im
not
    there, seek him i' th' other place yourself. But indeed, if
you
    find him not with
in this month, you shall nose him as you go
up
    the stair, into the lobby.
  King. Go seek him
 there. [To Attendants.]
  Ham. He will stay till you come.
                                      
      [Exeunt Attendants.]
  King. Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,-
    Which we do 
tender as we dearly grieve
    For that which thou hast done,- must send thee hence
    With fiery
 quickness. Therefore prepare thyself.
    The bark is ready and the wind at help,
    Th' associa
tes tend, and everything is bent
    For England.
  Ham. For England?
  King. Ay, Hamlet.
  Ham.
 Good.
  King. So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
  Ham. I see a cherub that sees them. But c
ome, for England!
    Farewell, dear mother.
  King. Thy loving father, Hamlet.
  Ham. My mother!
 Father and mother is man and wife; man and wife
is
    one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for En
gland!
Exit.
  King. Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard.
    Delay it not; I'll have
 him hence to-night.
    Away! for everything is seal'd and done
    That else leans on th' affair
. Pray you make haste.
                            Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]
    And, E
ngland, if my love thou hold'st at aught,-
    As my great power thereof may give thee sense,
    
Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
    After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
    Pays ho
mage to us,- thou mayst not coldly set
    Our sovereign process, which imports at full,
    By le
tters congruing to that effect,
    The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;
    For like the 
hectic in my blood he rages,
    And thou must cure me. Till I know 'tis done,
    Howe'er my haps
, my joys were ne'er begun.             Exit.

Scene IV.
Near Elsinore.

Ente
r Fortinbras with his Army over the stage.

  For. Go, Captain, from me greet the Danish king.
  
  Tell him that by his license Fortinbras
    Craves the conveyance of a promis'd march
    Over h
is kingdom. You know the rendezvous.
    If that his Majesty would aught with us,
    We shall exp
ress our duty in his eye;
    And let him know so.
  Capt. I will do't, my lord.
  For. Go softly
 on.
                                   Exeunt [all but the Captain].

       Enter Hamlet, Rosen
crantz, [Guildenstern,] and others.

  Ham. Good sir, whose powers are these?
  Capt. They are of
 Norway, sir.
  Ham. How purpos'd, sir, I pray you?
  Capt. Against some part of Poland.
  Ham. W
ho commands them, sir?
  Capt. The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.
  Ham. Goes it against the ma
in of Poland, sir,
    Or for some frontier?
  Capt. Truly to speak, and with no addition,
    We
 go to gain a little patch of ground
    That hath in it no profit but the name.
    To pay five d
ucats, five, I would not farm it;
    Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
    A ranker rate, s
hould it be sold in fee.
  Ham. Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
  Capt. Yes, it is alre
ady garrison'd.
  Ham. Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
    Will not debate the quest
ion of this straw.
    This is th' imposthume of much wealth and peace,
    That inward breaks, an
d shows no cause without
    Why the man dies.- I humbly thank you, sir.
  Capt. God b' wi' you, s
ir.                             [Exit.]
  Ros. Will't please you go, my lord?
  Ham. I'll be with 
you straight. Go a little before.
                                        [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]

    How all occasions do inform against me
    And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
    If hi
s chief good and market of his time
    Be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.
    Sure he th
at made us with such large discourse,
    Looking before and after, gave us not
    That capabilit
y and godlike reason
    To fust in us unus'd. Now, whether it be
    Bestial oblivion, or some cr
aven scruple
    Of thinking too precisely on th' event,-
    A thought which, quarter'd, hath but
 one part wisdom
    And ever three parts coward,- I do not know
    Why yet I live to say 'This t
hing's to do,'
    Sith I have cause, and will, and strength, and means
    To do't. Examples gros
s as earth exhort me.
    Witness this army of such mass and charge,
    Led by a delicate and ten
der prince,
    Whose spirit, with divine ambition puff'd,
    Makes mouths at the invisible event
,
    Exposing what is mortal and unsure
    To all that fortune, death, and danger dare,
    Eve
n for an eggshell. Rightly to be great
    Is not to stir without great argument,
    But greatly 
to find quarrel in a straw
    When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,
    That have a fathe
r kill'd, a mother stain'd,
    Excitements of my reason and my blood,
    And let all sleep, whil
e to my shame I see
    The imminent death of twenty thousand men
    That for a fantasy and trick
 of fame
    Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot
    Whereon the numbers cannot try the
 cause,
    Which is not tomb enough and continent
    To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,

    My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!            Exit.

Scene V.
El
sinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter Horatio, Queen, and a Gentleman.

  Queen. I will not speak
 with her.
  Gent. She is importunate, indeed distract.
    Her mood will needs be pitied.
  Quee
n. What would she have?
  Gent. She speaks much of her father; says she hears
    There's tricks i
' th' world, and hems, and beats her heart;
    Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,

    That carry but half sense. Her speech is nothing,
    Yet the unshaped use of it doth move
 
   The hearers to collection; they aim at it,
    And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;

    Which, as her winks and nods and gestures yield them,
    Indeed would make one think there m
ight be thought,
    Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
  Hor. 'Twere good she were spoken w
ith; for she may strew
    Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.
  Queen. Let her come in.

                                               [Exit Gentleman.]
    [Aside] To my sick soul (as s
in's true nature is)
    Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
    So full of artless jealo
usy is guilt
    It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.

                 Enter Ophelia distrac
ted.

  Oph. Where is the beauteous Majesty of Denmark?
  Queen. How now, Ophelia?
  Oph. (sings
)
         How should I your true-love know
           From another one?
         By his cockle b
at and' staff
           And his sandal shoon.

  Queen. Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song
?
  Oph. Say you? Nay, pray You mark.

    (Sings) He is dead and gone, lady,
              He i
s dead and gone;
            At his head a grass-green turf,
              At his heels a stone.


    O, ho!
  Queen. Nay, but Ophelia-
  Oph. Pray you mark.

    (Sings) White his shroud as t
he mountain snow-

                    Enter King.

  Queen. Alas, look here, my lord!
  Oph. (
Sings)
           Larded all with sweet flowers;
         Which bewept to the grave did not go
  
         With true-love showers.

  King. How do you, pretty lady?
  Oph. Well, God dild you! The
y say the owl was a baker's
daughter.
    Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be. 
God
be at
    your table!
  King. Conceit upon her father.
  Oph. Pray let's have no words of th
is; but when they ask, you
what
    it means, say you this:

    (Sings) To-morrow is Saint Vale
ntine's day,
              All in the morning bedtime,
            And I a maid at your window,
 
             To be your Valentine.

            Then up he rose and donn'd his clo'es
           
   And dupp'd the chamber door,
            Let in the maid, that out a maid
              Never d
eparted more.

  King. Pretty Ophelia!
  Oph. Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't!


    [Sings] By Gis and by Saint Charity,
              Alack, and fie for shame!
            Y
oung men will do't if they come to't
              By Cock, they are to blame.

            Quoth
 she, 'Before you tumbled me,
              You promis'd me to wed.'

    He answers:

        
    'So would I 'a' done, by yonder sun,
              An thou hadst not come to my bed.'

  King
. How long hath she been thus?
  Oph. I hope all will be well. We must be patient; but I cannot
  
  choose but weep to think they would lay him i' th' cold
ground.
    My brother shall know of it;
 and so I thank you for your good
    counsel. Come, my coach! Good night, ladies. Good night,
swe
et
    ladies. Good night, good night.                         Exit
  King. Follow her close; give
 her good watch, I pray you.
                                                 [Exit Horatio.]

  
  O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs
    All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gert
rude,
    When sorrows come, they come not single spies.
    But in battalions! First, her father 
slain;
    Next, your son gone, and he most violent author
    Of his own just remove; the people 
muddied,
    Thick and and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers
    For good Polonius' death
, and we have done but greenly
    In hugger-mugger to inter him; poor Ophelia
    Divided from he
rself and her fair judgment,
    Without the which we are pictures or mere beasts;
    Last, and a
s much containing as all these,
    Her brother is in secret come from France;
    And wants not b
uzzers to infect his ear
    Feeds on his wonder, keep, himself in clouds,
    With pestilent spee
ches of his father's death,
    Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
    Will nothing stick our 
person to arraign
    In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
    Like to a murd'ring piece, in 
many places
    Give me superfluous death.                  A noise within.
  Queen. Alack, what n
oise is this?
  King. Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.

                     Enter
 a Messenger.

    What is the matter?
  Mess. Save Yourself, my lord:
    The ocean, overpeerin
g of his list,
    Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
    Than Young Laertes, in a rioto
us head,
    O'erbears Your offices. The rabble call him lord;
    And, as the world were now but 
to begin,
    Antiquity forgot, custom not known,
    The ratifiers and props of every word,
    
They cry 'Choose we! Laertes shall be king!'
    Caps, hands, and tongues applaud it to the clouds,

    'Laertes shall be king! Laertes king!'
                                                 A noi
se within.
  Queen. How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!
    O, this is counter, you false 
Danish dogs!
  King. The doors are broke.

                    Enter Laertes with others.

  La
er. Where is this king?- Sirs, staid you all without.
  All. No, let's come in!
  Laer. I pray you
 give me leave.
  All. We will, we will!
  Laer. I thank you. Keep the door.      [Exeunt his Foll
owers.]
    O thou vile king,
    Give me my father!
  Queen. Calmly, good Laertes.
  Laer. That
 drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard;
    Cries cuckold to my father; brands the harlot

    Even here between the chaste unsmirched brows
    Of my true mother.
  King. What is the caus
e, Laertes,
    That thy rebellion looks so giantlike?
    Let him go, Gertrude. Do not fear our p
erson.
    There's such divinity doth hedge a king
    That treason can but peep to what it would,

    Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,
    Why thou art thus incens'd. Let him go, Gertru
de.
    Speak, man.
  Laer. Where is my father?
  King. Dead.
  Queen. But not by him!
  King. 
Let him demand his fill.
  Laer. How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
    To hell, allegian
ce! vows, to the blackest devil
    Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
    I dare damna
tion. To this point I stand,
    That both the world, I give to negligence,
    Let come what come
s; only I'll be reveng'd
    Most throughly for my father.
  King. Who shall stay you?
  Laer. My
 will, not all the world!
    And for my means, I'll husband them so well
    They shall go far wi
th little.
  King. Good Laertes,
    If you desire to know the certainty
    Of your dear father'
s death, is't writ in your revenge
    That sweepstake you will draw both friend and foe,
    Winn
er and loser?
  Laer. None but his enemies.
  King. Will you know them then?
  Laer. To his good 
friends thus wide I'll ope my arms
    And, like the kind life-rend'ring pelican,
    Repast them 
with my blood.
  King. Why, now You speak
    Like a good child and a true gentleman.
    That I 
am guiltless of your father's death,
    And am most sensibly in grief for it,
    It shall as lev
el to your judgment pierce
    As day does to your eye.
                              A noise with
in: 'Let her come in.'
  Laer. How now? What noise is that?

                      Enter Ophelia.


    O heat, dry up my brains! Tears seven times salt
    Burn out the sense and virtue of mine 
eye!
    By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight
    Till our scale turn the beam. O rose o
f May!
    Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
    O heavens! is't possible a young maid's wits

    Should be as mortal as an old man's life?
    Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,
 
   It sends some precious instance of itself
    After the thing it loves.

  Oph. (sings)
     
    They bore him barefac'd on the bier
           (Hey non nony, nony, hey nony)
         And in 
his grave rain'd many a tear.

    Fare you well, my dove!
  Laer. Hadst thou thy wits, and didst
 persuade revenge,
    It could not move thus.
  Oph. You must sing 'A-down a-down, and you call h
im a-down-a.'
O,
    how the wheel becomes it! It is the false steward, that stole
his
    maste
r's daughter.
  Laer. This nothing's more than matter.
  Oph. There's rosemary, that's for remembr
ance. Pray you, love,
    remember. And there is pansies, that's for thoughts.
  Laer. A document 
in madness! Thoughts and remembrance fitted.
  Oph. There's fennel for you, and columbines. There's
 rue for
you,
    and here's some for me. We may call it herb of grace o'
Sundays.
    O, you mu
st wear your rue with a difference! There's a daisy.
I
    would give you some violets, but they w
ither'd all when my
father
    died. They say he made a good end.

    [Sings] For bonny sweet R
obin is all my joy.

  Laer. Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,
    She turns to favou
r and to prettiness.
  Oph. (sings)
         And will he not come again?
         And will he not
 come again?
           No, no, he is dead;
           Go to thy deathbed;
         He never will
 come again.

         His beard was as white as snow,
         All flaxen was his poll.
       
    He is gone, he is gone,
           And we cast away moan.
         God 'a'mercy on his soul!


    And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God b' wi' you.
Exit.
  Laer. Do you see this, O God
?
  King. Laertes, I must commune with your grief,
    Or you deny me right. Go but apart,
    Ma
ke choice of whom your wisest friends you will,
    And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me
.
    If by direct or by collateral hand
    They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,
    
Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours,
    To you in satisfaction; but if not,
    Be you
 content to lend your patience to us,
    And we shall jointly labour with your soul
    To give i
t due content.
  Laer. Let this be so.
    His means of death, his obscure funeral-
    No trophy
, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,
    No noble rite nor formal ostentation,-
    Cry to be he
ard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
    That I must call't in question.
  King. So you shall;
  
  And where th' offence is let the great axe fall.
    I pray you go with me.
                    
                                      Exeunt

Enter Horatio with an Attendant.

  Hor. What are they that would speak with me?

  Servant. Seafaring men, sir. They say they have letters for
you.
  Hor. Let them come in.
   
                                            [Exit Attendant.]
    I do not know from what part of t

    I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.

                          Enter Sailo
rs.

  Sailor. God bless you, sir.
  Hor. Let him bless thee too.
  Sailor. 'A shall, sir, an't 
please him. There's a letter for
you,
    sir,- it comes from th' ambassador that was bound for
E
ngland- if
    your name be Horatio, as I am let to know it is.
  Hor. (reads the letter) 'Horatio
, when thou shalt have
overlook'd
    this, give these fellows some means to the King. They have

    letters for him. Ere we were two days old at sea, a pirate of

    very warlike appointment ga

    slow of sail, we put on a compelled valour, and in the
grap
ple I
    boarded them. On the instant they got clear of our ship; so I
    alone became their pri
soner. They have dealt with me like
thieves
    of mercy; but they knew what they did: I am to do 
a good turn
for
    them. Let the King have the letters I have sent, and repair
thou
    to me w

words
    to speak in thine ear will make thee

                            'He that thou knowest thine, HAMLET.'


    Come, I will give you way for these your letters,

Scene V
II.
Elsinore. Another room in the Castle.

Enter King and Laertes.

  King. Now must your consc
ience my acquittance seal,
    And You must put me in your heart for friend,
    Sith you have hea
rd, and with a knowing ear,
    That he which hath your noble father slain
    Pursued my life.
 
 Laer. It well appears. But tell me
    Why you proceeded not against these feats
    So crimeful 
and so capital in nature,
    As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
    You mainly were stir
r'd up.
  King. O, for two special reasons,
    Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,
 
   But yet to me they are strong. The Queen his mother
    Lives almost by his looks; and for mysel
f,-
    My virtue or my plague, be it either which,-
    She's so conjunctive to my life and soul

    That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
    I could not but by her. The other motive
 
   Why to a public count I might not go
    Is the great love the general gender bear him,
    Who
, dipping all his faults in their affection,
    Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,

    Convert his gives to graces; so that my arrows,
    Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,

    Would have reverted to my bow again,
    And not where I had aim'd them.
  Laer. And so have
 I a noble father lost;
    A sister driven into desp'rate terms,
    Whose worth, if praises may 
go back again,
    Stood challenger on mount of all the age
    For her perfections. But my reveng
e will come.
  King. Break not your sleeps for that. You must not think
    That we are made of st
uff so flat and dull
    That we can let our beard be shook with danger,
    And think it pastime.
 You shortly shall hear more.
    I lov'd your father, and we love ourself,
    And that, I hope, 
will teach you to imagine-

                 Enter a Messenger with letters.

    How now? What 
news?
  Mess. Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:
    This to your Majesty; this to the Queen.
  King.
 From Hamlet? Who brought them?
  Mess. Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not.
    They were 
given me by Claudio; he receiv'd them
    Of him that brought them.
  King. Laertes, you shall hea
r them.
    Leave us.
                                                 Exit Messenger.
    [Reads
]'High and Mighty,-You shall know I am set naked on
your
    kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave 
to see your kingly eyes;
    when I shall (first asking your pardon thereunto) recount the
    occ
asion of my sudden and more strange return.
                                                     'H
AMLET.'
    What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?
    Or is it some abuse, and no suc
h thing?
  Laer. Know you the hand?
  King. 'Tis Hamlet's character. 'Naked!'
    And in a postsc
ript here, he says 'alone.'
    Can you advise me?
  Laer. I am lost in it, my lord. But let him c
ome!
    It warms the very sickness in my heart
    That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,

    'Thus didest thou.'
  King. If it be so, Laertes
    (As how should it be so? how otherwise?),

    Will you be rul'd by me?
  Laer. Ay my lord,
    So you will not o'errule me to a peace.
  
King. To thine own peace. If he be now return'd
    As checking at his voyage, and that he means
 
   No more to undertake it, I will work him
    To exploit now ripe in my device,
    Under the wh
ich he shall not choose but fall;
    And for his death no wind shall breathe
    But even his mot
her shall uncharge the practice
    And call it accident.
  Laer. My lord, I will be rul'd;
    T
he rather, if you could devise it so
    That I might be the organ.
  King. It falls right.
    Y
ou have been talk'd of since your travel much,
    And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality
   
 Wherein they say you shine, Your sum of parts
    Did not together pluck such envy from him
    A
s did that one; and that, in my regard,
    Of the unworthiest siege.
  Laer. What part is that, m
y lord?
  King. A very riband in the cap of youth-
    Yet needfull too; for youth no less becomes

    The light and careless livery that it wears
    Than settled age his sables and his weeds,
 
   Importing health and graveness. Two months since
    Here was a gentleman of Normandy.
    I ha
ve seen myself, and serv'd against, the French,
    And they can well on horseback; but this gallan
t
    Had witchcraft in't. He grew unto his seat,
    And to such wondrous doing brought his horse

    As had he been incorps'd and demi-natur'd
    With the brave beast. So far he topp'd my thoug
ht
    That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
    Come short of what he did.
  Laer. A Norman w
as't?
  King. A Norman.
  Laer. Upon my life, Lamound.
  King. The very same.
  Laer. I know him
 well. He is the broach indeed
    And gem of all the nation.
  King. He made confession of you;

    And gave you such a masterly report
    For art and exercise in your defence,
    And for your
 rapier most especially,
    That he cried out 'twould be a sight indeed
    If one could match yo
u. The scrimers of their nation
    He swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
    If you oppos'
d them. Sir, this report of his
    Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
    That he could nothing 
do but wish and beg
    Your sudden coming o'er to play with you.
    Now, out of this-
  Laer. W
hat out of this, my lord?
  King. Laertes, was your father dear to you?
    Or are you like the pa
inting of a sorrow,
    A face without a heart,'
  Laer. Why ask you this?
  King. Not that I thi
nk you did not love your father;
    But that I know love is begun by time,
    And that I see, in
 passages of proof,
    Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
    There lives within the very f
lame of love
    A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
    And nothing is at a like goodness
 still;
    For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
    Dies in his own too-much. That we would do,
 
   We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes,
    And hath abatements and delays as many

    As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
    And then this 'should' is like a spendthr
ift sigh,
    That hurts by easing. But to the quick o' th' ulcer!
    Hamlet comes back. What wou
ld you undertake
    To show yourself your father's son in deed
    More than in words?
  Laer. T
o cut his throat i' th' church!
  King. No place indeed should murther sanctuarize;
    Revenge sh
ould have no bounds. But, good Laertes,
    Will you do this? Keep close within your chamber.
    
Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home.
    We'll put on those shall praise your excellence

    And set a double varnish on the fame
    The Frenchman gave you; bring you in fine together
  
  And wager on your heads. He, being remiss,
    Most generous, and free from all contriving,
    
Will not peruse the foils; so that with ease,
    Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
    A
 sword unbated, and, in a pass of practice,
    Requite him for your father.
  Laer. I will do't!

    And for that purpose I'll anoint my sword.
    I bought an unction of a mountebank,
    So mo
rtal that, but dip a knife in it,
    Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
    Collected fro
m all simples that have virtue
    Under the moon, can save the thing from death
    This is but s
cratch'd withal. I'll touch my point
    With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
    It
 may be death.
  King. Let's further think of this,
    Weigh what convenience both of time and me
ans
    May fit us to our shape. If this should fall,
    And that our drift look through our bad 
performance.
    'Twere better not assay'd. Therefore this project
    Should have a back or secon
d, that might hold
    If this did blast in proof. Soft! let me see.
    We'll make a solemn wager
 on your cunnings-
    I ha't!
    When in your motion you are hot and dry-
    As make your bout
s more violent to that end-
    And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepar'd him
    A chalice 
for the nonce; whereon but sipping,
    If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
    Our purpose
 may hold there.- But stay, what noise,

                           Enter Queen.

    How now, s
weet queen?
  Queen. One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
    So fast they follow. Your sister'
s drown'd, Laertes.
  Laer. Drown'd! O, where?
  Queen. There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
 
   That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream.
    There with fantastic garlands did she come

    Of crowflowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,
    That liberal shepherds give a grosser 
name,
    But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them.
    There on the pendant boughs her 
coronet weeds
    Clamb'ring to hang, an envious sliver broke,
    When down her weedy trophies an
d herself
    Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide
    And, mermaid-like, awhile the
y bore her up;
    Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes,
    As one incapable of her own 
distress,
    Or like a creature native and indued
    Unto that element; but long it could not be

    Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
    Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious
 lay
    To muddy death.
  Laer. Alas, then she is drown'd?
  Queen. Drown'd, drown'd.
  Laer. T
oo much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
    And therefore I forbid my tears; but yet
    It is o
ur trick; nature her custom holds,
    Let shame say what it will. When these are gone,
    The wo
man will be out. Adieu, my lord.
    I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze
    But that t
his folly douts it.                          Exit.
  King. Let's follow, Gertrude.
    How much I 
had to do to calm his rage I
    Now fear I this will give it start again;
    Therefore let's fol
low.
                                                         Exeunt.

ACT V. S
cene I.
Elsinore. A churchyard.

Enter two Clowns, [with spades and pickaxes].

  Clown. Is she
 to be buried in Christian burial when she
wilfully
    seeks her own salvation?
  Other. I tell 
thee she is; therefore make her grave straight.
    The crowner hath sate on her, and finds it Chri
stian burial.
  Clown. How can that be, unless she drown'd herself in her own
    defence?
  Othe
r. Why, 'tis found so.
  Clown. It must be se offendendo; it cannot be else. For here
lies
    th
e point: if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act; and
an
    act hath three branches-it is t
o act, to do, and to perform;
    argal, she drown'd herself wittingly.
  Other. Nay, but hear you
, Goodman Delver!
  Clown. Give me leave. Here lies the water; good. Here stands
the
    man; goo
d. If the man go to this water and drown himself, it
is,
    will he nill he, he goes- mark you th
at. But if the water
come to
    him and drown him, he drowns not himself. Argal, he that is
not

    guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.
  Other. But is this law?
  Clown. Ay, mar
ry, is't- crowner's quest law.
  Other. Will you ha' the truth an't? If this had not been a
    ge
ntlewoman, she should have been buried out o' Christian
burial.
  Clown. Why, there thou say'st! A
nd the more pity that great
folk
    should have count'nance in this world to drown or hang
thems
elves
    more than their even-Christian. Come, my spade! There is no
    ancient gentlemen but ga
rd'ners, ditchers, and grave-makers.
They
    hold up Adam's profession.
  Other. Was he a gentle
man?
  Clown. 'A was the first that ever bore arms.
  Other. Why, he had none.
  Clown. What, art
 a heathen? How dost thou understand the
Scripture?
    The Scripture says Adam digg'd. Could he d
ig without arms?
I'll
    put another question to thee. If thou answerest me not to the
    purpo
se, confess thyself-
  Other. Go to!
  Clown. What is he that builds stronger than either the maso
n,
the
    shipwright, or the carpenter?
  Other. The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a th
ousand
    tenants.
  Clown. I like thy wit well, in good faith. The gallows does
well.
    But 
how does it well? It does well to those that do ill. Now,
    thou dost ill to say the gallows is b
uilt stronger than the
    church. Argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To't again,
come!
  Ot
her. Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a
    carpenter?
  Clown. Ay, tell me that
, and unyoke.
  Other. Marry, now I can tell!
  Clown. To't.
  Other. Mass, I cannot tell.

   
              Enter Hamlet and Horatio afar off.

  Clown. Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for
 your dull ass
will
    not mend his pace with beating; and when you are ask'd this
    question 
next, say 'a grave-maker.' The houses he makes lasts
    till doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan; fe
tch me a stoup of
    liquor.
                                            [Exit Second Clown.]



                       [Clown digs and] sings.

       In youth when I did love, did love,
    
     Methought it was very sweet;
       To contract- O- the time for- a- my behove,
         O, m
ethought there- a- was nothing- a- meet.

  Ham. Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that 
he sings
at
    grave-making?
  Hor. Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.
  Ham. '
Tis e'en so. The hand of little employment hath the
daintier
    sense.
  Clown. (sings)
       
  But age with his stealing steps
           Hath clawed me in his clutch,
         And hath shipp
ed me intil the land,
           As if I had never been such.
                                    
        [Throws up a skull.]

  Ham. That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once. How
the

    knave jowls it to the ground,as if 'twere Cain's jawbone,
that
    did the first murther! Thi
s might be the pate of a
Politician,
    which this ass now o'erreaches; one that would circumvent

God,
    might it not?
  Hor. It might, my lord.
  Ham. Or of a courtier, which could say 'Good
 morrow, sweet
lord!
    How dost thou, good lord?' This might be my Lord Such-a-one,
that
    p
rais'd my Lord Such-a-one's horse when he meant to beg it-
might
    it not?
  Hor. Ay, my lord.

  Ham. Why, e'en so! and now my Lady Worm's, chapless, and
knock'd
    about the mazzard with a s
exton's spade. Here's fine
revolution,
    and we had the trick to see't. Did these bones cost no 
more
the
    breeding but to play at loggets with 'em? Mine ache to think
    on't.
  Clown. (Si
ngs)
         A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,
           For and a shrouding sheet;
         O, a
 Pit of clay for to be made
           For such a guest is meet.
                                 
     Throws up [another skull].

  Ham. There's another. Why may not that be the skull of a
lawye
r?
    Where be his quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, his
tenures,
    and his tricks? Why d
oes he suffer this rude knave now to
knock
    him about the sconce with a dirty shovel, and will 
not tell
him
    of his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be in's time
a
    great buyer
 of land, with his statutes, his recognizances,
his
    fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries
. Is this the fine
of
    his fines, and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his
fine
    pa
te full of fine dirt? Will his vouchers vouch him no more
of
    his purchases, and double ones to
o, than the length and
breadth
    of a pair of indentures? The very conveyances of his lands
wil
l
    scarcely lie in this box; and must th' inheritor himself have
no
    more, ha?
  Hor. Not 
a jot more, my lord.
  Ham. Is not parchment made of sheepskins?
  Hor. Ay, my lord, And of calves
kins too.
  Ham. They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in
that. I
    will speak to 
this fellow. Whose grave's this, sirrah?
  Clown. Mine, sir.

    [Sings] O, a pit of clay for to
 be made
              For such a guest is meet.

  Ham. I think it be thine indeed, for thou lie
st in't.
  Clown. You lie out on't, sir, and therefore 'tis not yours.
    For my part, I do not l
ie in't, yet it is mine.
  Ham. Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine. 'Tis
for
    
the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.
  Clown. 'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away agai
n from me to you.
  Ham. What man dost thou dig it for?
  Clown. For no man, sir.
  Ham. What wom
an then?
  Clown. For none neither.
  Ham. Who is to be buried in't?
  Clown. One that was a woma
n, sir; but, rest her soul, she's
dead.
  Ham. How absolute the knave is! We must speak by the car
d, or
    equivocation will undo us. By the Lord, Horatio, this three
years
    I have taken note
 of it, the age is grown so picked that the
toe
    of the peasant comes so near the heel of the c
ourtier he
galls
    his kibe.- How long hast thou been a grave-maker?
  Clown. Of all the days i
' th' year, I came to't that day that
our
    last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.
  Ham. How lo
ng is that since?
  Clown. Cannot you tell that? Every fool can tell that. It was
the
    very da
y that young Hamlet was born- he that is mad, and sent
    into England.
  Ham. Ay, marry, why was
 be sent into England?
  Clown. Why, because 'a was mad. 'A shall recover his wits
there;
    or,
 if 'a do not, 'tis no great matter there.
  Ham. Why?
  Clown. 'Twill not he seen in him there. T
here the men are as
mad as
    he.
  Ham. How came he mad?
  Clown. Very strangely, they say.
 
 Ham. How strangely?
  Clown. Faith, e'en with losing his wits.
  Ham. Upon what ground?
  Clown.
 Why, here in Denmark. I have been sexton here, man and
boy
    thirty years.
  Ham. How long wil
l a man lie i' th' earth ere he rot?
  Clown. Faith, if 'a be not rotten before 'a die (as we have

many
    pocky corses now-a-days that will scarce hold the laying in,
I
    will last you some e
ight year or nine year. A tanner will
last
    you nine year.
  Ham. Why he more than another?
 
 Clown. Why, sir, his hide is so tann'd with his trade that 'a
will
    keep out water a great whi
le; and your water is a sore
decayer of
    your whoreson dead body. Here's a skull now. This skul
l hath
lien
    you i' th' earth three-and-twenty years.
  Ham. Whose was it?
  Clown. A whoreso
n, mad fellow's it was. Whose do you think it
was?
  Ham. Nay, I know not.
  Clown. A pestilence 
on him for a mad rogue! 'A pour'd a flagon
of
    Rhenish on my head once. This same skull, sir, w
as Yorick's
    skull, the King's jester.
  Ham. This?
  Clown. E'en that.
  Ham. Let me see. [T
akes the skull.] Alas, poor Yorick! I knew
him,
    Horatio. A fellow of infinite jest, of most ex
cellent fancy.
He
    hath borne me on his back a thousand times. And now how
abhorred
    in my
 imagination it is! My gorge rises at it. Here hung
those
    lips that I have kiss'd I know not h
ow oft. Where be your
gibes
    now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment that
   
 were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock
your
    own grinning? Quite chap- fal
l'n? Now get you to my lady's
    chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this
    
favour she must come. Make her laugh at that. Prithee,
Horatio,
    tell me one thing.
  Hor. Wha
t's that, my lord?
  Ham. Dost thou think Alexander look'd o' this fashion i' th'
earth?
  Hor. E
'en so.
  Ham. And smelt so? Pah!
                                          [Puts down the skull.]

  Hor. E'en so, my lord.
  Ham. To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not
    imagin
ation trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it
    stopping a bunghole?
  Hor. 'Twere to 
consider too curiously, to consider so.
  Ham. No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with

modesty
    enough, and likelihood to lead it; as thus: Alexander died,
    Alexander was buried
, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust
is
    earth; of earth we make loam; and why of that loa
m (whereto
he
    was converted) might they not stop a beer barrel?
    Imperious Caesar, dead an
d turn'd to clay,
    Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.
    O, that that earth which kept t
he world in awe
    Should patch a wall t' expel the winter's flaw!
    But soft! but soft! aside!
 Here comes the King-

    Enter [priests with] a coffin [in funeral procession], King,
         
    Queen, Laertes, with Lords attendant.]

    The Queen, the courtiers. Who is this they follow?

    And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken
    The corse they follow did with desp'rate ha
nd
    Fordo it own life. 'Twas of some estate.
    Couch we awhile, and mark.
                  
                       [Retires with Horatio.]

  Laer. What ceremony else?
  Ham. That is Laerte
s,
    A very noble youth. Mark.
  Laer. What ceremony else?
  Priest. Her obsequies have been as
 far enlarg'd
    As we have warranty. Her death was doubtful;
    And, but that great command o'e
rsways the order,
    She should in ground unsanctified have lodg'd
    Till the last trumpet. For
 charitable prayers,
    Shards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on her.
    Yet here she is 
allow'd her virgin rites,
    Her maiden strewments, and the bringing home
    Of bell and burial.

  Laer. Must there no more be done?
  Priest. No more be done.
    We should profane the service
 of the dead
    To sing a requiem and such rest to her
    As to peace-parted souls.
  Laer. Lay
 her i' th' earth;
    And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
    May violets spring! I tell thee,
 churlish priest,
    A minist'ring angel shall my sister be
    When thou liest howling.
  Ham. 
What, the fair Ophelia?
  Queen. Sweets to the sweet! Farewell.
                                  
           [Scatters flowers.]
    I hop'd thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
    I thought
 thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
    And not have strew'd thy grave.
  Laer. O, treble w
oe
    Fall ten times treble on that cursed head
    Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
 
   Depriv'd thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,
    Till I have caught her once more in mine arms.

                                             Leaps in the grave.
    Now pile your dust upon the q
uick and dead
    Till of this flat a mountain you have made
    T' o'ertop old Pelion or the skyi
sh head
    Of blue Olympus.
  Ham. [comes forward] What is he whose grief
    Bears such an emph
asis? whose phrase of sorrow
    Conjures the wand'ring stars, and makes them stand
    Like wonde
r-wounded hearers? This is I,
    Hamlet the Dane.                    [Leaps in after Laertes.
  L
aer. The devil take thy soul!
                                            [Grapples with him].
  H
am. Thou pray'st not well.
    I prithee take thy fingers from my throat;
    For, though I am not
 splenitive and rash,
    Yet have I in me something dangerous,
    Which let thy wisdom fear. Hol
d off thy hand!
  King. Pluck them asunder.
  Queen. Hamlet, Hamlet!
  All. Gentlemen!
  Hor. Go
od my lord, be quiet.
             [The Attendants part them, and they come out of the
           
                                              grave.]
  Ham. Why, I will fight with him upon this t
heme
    Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
  Queen. O my son, what theme?
  Ham. I lov'd Ophel
ia. Forty thousand brothers
    Could not (with all their quantity of love)
    Make up my sum. Wh
at wilt thou do for her?
  King. O, he is mad, Laertes.
  Queen. For love of God, forbear him!
  
Ham. 'Swounds, show me what thou't do.
    Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?

    Woo't drink up esill? eat a crocodile?
    I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?
    To o
utface me with leaping in her grave?
    Be buried quick with her, and so will I.
    And if thou 
prate of mountains, let them throw
    Millions of acres on us, till our ground,
    Singeing his 
pate against the burning zone,
    Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
    I'll rant as 
well as thou.
  Queen. This is mere madness;
    And thus a while the fit will work on him.
    A
non, as patient as the female dove
    When that her golden couplets are disclos'd,
    His silenc
e will sit drooping.
  Ham. Hear you, sir!
    What is the reason that you use me thus?
    I lov
'd you ever. But it is no matter.
    Let Hercules himself do what he may,
    The cat will mew, a
nd dog will have his day.
Exit.
  King. I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.
               
                                    Exit Horatio.
    [To Laertes] Strengthen your patience in our 
last night's
speech.
    We'll put the matter to the present push.-
    Good Gertrude, set some w
atch over your son.-
    This grave shall have a living monument.
    An hour of quiet shortly sha
ll we see;
    Till then in patience our proceeding be.
                                          
               Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A hall in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet and Horat
io.

  Ham. So much for this, sir; now shall you see the other.
    You do remember all the circu
mstance?
  Hor. Remember it, my lord!
  Ham. Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting
    Th
at would not let me sleep. Methought I lay
    Worse than the mutinies in the bilboes. Rashly-
   
 And prais'd be rashness for it; let us know,
    Our indiscretion sometime serves us well
    Whe
n our deep plots do pall; and that should learn us
    There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
  
  Rough-hew them how we will-
  Hor. That is most certain.
  Ham. Up from my cabin,
    My sea-go
wn scarf'd about me, in the dark
    Grop'd I to find out them; had my desire,
    Finger'd their 
packet, and in fine withdrew
    To mine own room again; making so bold
    (My fears forgetting m
anners) to unseal
    Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio
    (O royal knavery!), an ex
act command,
    Larded with many several sorts of reasons,
    Importing Denmark's health, and En
gland's too,
    With, hoo! such bugs and goblins in my life-
    That, on the supervise, no leisu
re bated,
    No, not to stay the finding of the axe,
    My head should be struck off.
  Hor. Is
't possible?
  Ham. Here's the commission; read it at more leisure.
    But wilt thou bear me how 
I did proceed?
  Hor. I beseech you.
  Ham. Being thus benetted round with villanies,
    Or I co
uld make a prologue to my brains,
    They had begun the play. I sat me down;
    Devis'd a new co
mmission; wrote it fair.
    I once did hold it, as our statists do,
    A baseness to write fair,
 and labour'd much
    How to forget that learning; but, sir, now
    It did me yeoman's service. 
Wilt thou know
    Th' effect of what I wrote?
  Hor. Ay, good my lord.
  Ham. An earnest conjura
tion from the King,
    As England was his faithful tributary,
    As love between them like the p
alm might flourish,
    As peace should still her wheaten garland wear
    And stand a comma 'twee
n their amities,
    And many such-like as's of great charge,
    That, on the view and knowing of
 these contents,
    Without debatement further, more or less,
    He should the bearers put to su
dden death,
    Not shriving time allow'd.
  Hor. How was this seal'd?
  Ham. Why, even in that w
as heaven ordinant.
    I had my father's signet in my purse,
    Which was the model of that Dani
sh seal;
    Folded the writ up in the form of th' other,
    Subscrib'd it, gave't th' impression
, plac'd it safely,
    The changeling never known. Now, the next day
    Was our sea-fight; and w
hat to this was sequent
    Thou know'st already.
  Hor. So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.

  Ham. Why, man, they did make love to this employment!
    They are not near my conscience; their
 defeat
    Does by their own insinuation grow.
    'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
  
  Between the pass and fell incensed points
    Of mighty opposites.
  Hor. Why, what a king is th
is!
  Ham. Does it not, thinks't thee, stand me now upon-
    He that hath kill'd my king, and who
r'd my mother;
    Popp'd in between th' election and my hopes;
    Thrown out his angle for my pr
oper life,
    And with such coz'nage- is't not perfect conscience
    To quit him with this arm? 
And is't not to be damn'd
    To let this canker of our nature come
    In further evil?
  Hor. I
t must be shortly known to him from England
    What is the issue of the business there.
  Ham. It
 will be short; the interim is mine,
    And a man's life is no more than to say 'one.'
    But I 
am very sorry, good Horatio,
    That to Laertes I forgot myself,
    For by the image of my cause
 I see
    The portraiture of his. I'll court his favours.
    But sure the bravery of his grief d
id put me
    Into a tow'ring passion.
  Hor. Peace! Who comes here?

                 Enter you
ng Osric, a courtier.

  Osr. Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
  Ham. I humbly tha
nk you, sir. [Aside to Horatio] Dost know this
    waterfly?
  Hor. [aside to Hamlet] No, my good 
lord.
  Ham. [aside to Horatio] Thy state is the more gracious; for
'tis a
    vice to know him. 
He hath much land, and fertile. Let a beast
be
    lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at the
 king's mess.
'Tis
    a chough; but, as I say, spacious in the possession of dirt.

  Osr. Swee
t lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should
impart
    a thing to you from his Majesty.
  
Ham. I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit. Put
your
    bonnet to his right use. '
Tis for the head.
  Osr. I thank your lordship, it is very hot.
  Ham. No, believe me, 'tis very c
old; the wind is northerly.
  Osr. It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
  Ham. But yet methink
s it is very sultry and hot for my
complexion.
  Osr. Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry, as 
'twere- I
cannot
    tell how. But, my lord, his Majesty bade me signify to you
that
    he has 
laid a great wager on your head. Sir, this is the
matter-
  Ham. I beseech you remember.
        
                   [Hamlet moves him to put on his hat.]
  Osr. Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, i
n good faith. Sir, here
is
    newly come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute
gentleman,
 
   full of most excellent differences, of very soft society and
    great showing. Indeed, to speak
 feelingly of him, he is the
card
    or calendar of gentry; for you shall find in him the
contin
ent of
    what part a gentleman would see.
  Ham. Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you
; though, I

    know, to divide him inventorially would dozy th' arithmetic
of
    memory, and 
yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail.
    But, in the verity of extolment, I take him t
o be a soul of
great
    article, and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as, to
make
    t
rue diction of him, his semblable is his mirror, and who
else
    would trace him, his umbrage, no
thing more.
  Osr. Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
  Ham. The concernancy, sir? Why d
o we wrap the gentleman in our
more
    rawer breath?
  Osr. Sir?
  Hor [aside to Hamlet] Is't n
ot possible to understand in
another
    tongue? You will do't, sir, really.
  Ham. What imports 
the nomination of this gentleman?
  Osr. Of Laertes?
  Hor. [aside] His purse is empty already. Al
l's golden words are
    spent.
  Ham. Of him, sir.
  Osr. I know you are not ignorant-
  Ham. I
 would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would
not
    much approve me. Well, sir?
  Os
r. You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is-
  Ham. I dare not confess that, lest I shoul
d compare with him in
    excellence; but to know a man well were to know himself.
  Osr. I mean, 
sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on
him
    by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.

  Ham. What's his weapon?
  Osr. Rapier and dagger.
  Ham. That's two of his weapons- but well.
 
 Osr. The King, sir, hath wager'd with him six Barbary horses;
    against the which he has impon'd
, as I take it, six French
    rapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers,
and

    so. Three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy,
    very responsive to the hilts,
 most delicate carriages, and of
    very liberal conceit.
  Ham. What call you the carriages?
  
Hor. [aside to Hamlet] I knew you must be edified by the
margent
    ere you had done.
  Osr. The
 carriages, sir, are the hangers.
  Ham. The phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could

    carry cannon by our sides. I would it might be hangers till
then.
    But on! Six Barbary ho
rses against six French swords, their
    assigns, and three liberal-conceited carriages: that's th
e
French
    bet against the Danish. Why is this all impon'd, as you call
it?
  Osr. The King, s
ir, hath laid that, in a dozen passes between
    yourself and him, he shall not exceed you three h
its; he hath
    laid on twelve for nine, and it would come to immediate trial
    if your lordshi
p would vouchsafe the answer.
  Ham. How if I answer no?
  Osr. I mean, my lord, the opposition of
 your person in trial.
  Ham. Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please his
Majesty,
    it
 is the breathing time of day with me. Let the foils be
    brought, the gentleman willing, and the
 King hold his
purpose,
    I will win for him if I can; if not, I will gain nothing but
my
    
shame and the odd hits.
  Osr. Shall I redeliver you e'en so?
  Ham. To this effect, sir, after wh
at flourish your nature will.
  Osr. I commend my duty to your lordship.
  Ham. Yours, yours. [Exi
t Osric.] He does well to commend it
    himself; there are no tongues else for's turn.
  Hor. Thi
s lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.
  Ham. He did comply with his dug before he suck'd 
it. Thus has
he,
    and many more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age
dotes
    on, onl
y got the tune of the time and outward habit of
encounter-
    a kind of yesty collection, which c
arries them through and
    through the most fann'd and winnowed opinions; and do but
blow
    th
em to their trial-the bubbles are out,

                            Enter a Lord.

  Lord. My lo
rd, his Majesty commended him to you by young Osric,
who
    brings back to him, that you attend h
im in the hall. He sends
to
    know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you
will

    take longer time.
  Ham. I am constant to my purposes; they follow the King's
pleasure.
   
 If his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or whensoever,
provided
    I be so able as now.
  Lor
d. The King and Queen and all are coming down.
  Ham. In happy time.
  Lord. The Queen desires you
 to use some gentle entertainment to
    Laertes before you fall to play.
  Ham. She well instruct
s me.
                                                    [Exit Lord.]
  Hor. You will lose this w
ager, my lord.
  Ham. I do not think so. Since he went into France I have been
in
    continual p
ractice. I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst
not
    think how ill all's here about my heart
. But it is no matter.
  Hor. Nay, good my lord -
  Ham. It is but foolery; but it is such a kind 
of gaingiving as
    would perhaps trouble a woman.
  Hor. If your mind dislike anything, obey it.
 I will forestall
their
    repair hither and say you are not fit.
  Ham. Not a whit, we defy aug
ury; there's a special providence
in
    the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not to come; if
 it
be
    not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will
come:
    the readiness is
 all. Since no man knows aught of what he
leaves,
    what is't to leave betimes? Let be.

    E
nter King, Queen, Laertes, Osric, and Lords, with other
              Attendants with foils and gau
ntlets.
               A table and flagons of wine on it.

  King. Come, Hamlet, come, and take t
his hand from me.
                    [The King puts Laertes' hand into Hamlet's.]
  Ham. Give me 
your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong;
    But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.
    This presen
ce knows,
    And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd
    With sore distraction. What I h
ave done
    That might your nature, honour, and exception
    Roughly awake, I here proclaim was 
madness.
    Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet.
    If Hamlet from himself be taken away,

    And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
    Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.

    Who does it, then? His madness. If't be so,
    Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
   
 His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
    Sir, in this audience,
    Let my disclaiming from a purp
os'd evil
    Free me so far in your most generous thoughts
    That I have shot my arrow o'er the
 house
    And hurt my brother.
  Laer. I am satisfied in nature,
    Whose motive in this case s
hould stir me most
    To my revenge. But in my terms of honour
    I stand aloof, and will no rec
oncilement
    Till by some elder masters of known honour
    I have a voice and precedent of peac
e
    To keep my name ungor'd. But till that time
    I do receive your offer'd love like love,
 
   And will not wrong it.
  Ham. I embrace it freely,
    And will this brother's wager frankly pl
ay.
    Give us the foils. Come on.
  Laer. Come, one for me.
  Ham. I'll be your foil, Laertes. 
In mine ignorance
    Your skill shall, like a star i' th' darkest night,
    Stick fiery off inde
ed.
  Laer. You mock me, sir.
  Ham. No, by this hand.
  King. Give them the foils, young Osric. 
Cousin Hamlet,
    You know the wager?
  Ham. Very well, my lord.
    Your Grace has laid the odd
s o' th' weaker side.
  King. I do not fear it, I have seen you both;
    But since he is better'd
, we have therefore odds.
  Laer. This is too heavy; let me see another.
  Ham. This likes me well
. These foils have all a length?
                                                Prepare to play.

  Osr. Ay, my good lord.
  King. Set me the stoups of wine upon that table.
    If Hamlet give the
 first or second hit,
    Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
    Let all the battlements the
ir ordnance fire;
    The King shall drink to Hamlet's better breath,
    And in the cup an union 
shall he throw
    Richer than that which four successive kings
    In Denmark's crown have worn. 
Give me the cups;
    And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
    The trumpet to the cannoneer wi
thout,
    The cannons to the heavens, the heaven to earth,
    'Now the King drinks to Hamlet.' C
ome, begin.
    And you the judges, bear a wary eye.
  Ham. Come on, sir.
  Laer. Come, my lord. 
                               They play.
  Ham. One.
  Laer. No.
  Ham. Judgment!
  Osr. A hit,
 a very palpable hit.
  Laer. Well, again!
  King. Stay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thin
e;
    Here's to thy health.
               [Drum; trumpets sound; a piece goes off [within].
   
 Give him the cup.
  Ham. I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile.
    Come. (They play.) Anot
her hit. What say you?
  Laer. A touch, a touch; I do confess't.
  King. Our son shall win.
  Que
en. He's fat, and scant of breath.
    Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows.
    The Queen 
carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
  Ham. Good madam!
  King. Gertrude, do not drink.
  Queen. I wi
ll, my lord; I pray you pardon me.          Drinks.
  King. [aside] It is the poison'd cup; it is t
oo late.
  Ham. I dare not drink yet, madam; by-and-by.
  Queen. Come, let me wipe thy face.
  La
er. My lord, I'll hit him now.
  King. I do not think't.
  Laer. [aside] And yet it is almost agai
nst my conscience.
  Ham. Come for the third, Laertes! You but dally.
    Pray you pass with your 
best violence;
    I am afeard you make a wanton of me.
  Laer. Say you so? Come on.              
                 Play.
  Osr. Nothing neither way.
  Laer. Have at you now!
                [Laer
tes wounds Hamlet; then] in scuffling, they
                    change rapiers, [and Hamlet wounds 
Laertes].
  King. Part them! They are incens'd.
  Ham. Nay come! again!                         Th
e Queen falls.

  Osr. Look to the Queen there, ho!
  Hor. They bleed on both sides. How is it, m
y lord?
  Osr. How is't, Laertes?
  Laer. Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric.
    I am
 justly kill'd with mine own treachery.
  Ham. How does the Queen?
  King. She sounds to see them 
bleed.
  Queen. No, no! the drink, the drink! O my dear Hamlet!
    The drink, the drink! I am poi
son'd.                 [Dies.]
  Ham. O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd.
    Treachery! Seek i
t out.
                                                [Laertes falls.]
  Laer. It is here, Hamlet
. Hamlet, thou art slain;
    No medicine in the world can do thee good.
    In thee there is not 
half an hour of life.
    The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
    Unbated and envenom'd. Th
e foul practice
    Hath turn'd itself on me. Lo, here I lie,
    Never to rise again. Thy mother'
s poison'd.
    I can no more. The King, the King's to blame.
  Ham. The point envenom'd too?
   
 Then, venom, to thy work.                    Hurts the King.
  All. Treason! treason!
  King. O, 
yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt.
  Ham. Here, thou incestuous, murd'rous, damned Dane,
    D
rink off this potion! Is thy union here?
    Follow my mother.                                 King
 dies.
  Laer. He is justly serv'd.
    It is a poison temper'd by himself.
    Exchange forgiven
ess with me, noble Hamlet.
    Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
    Nor thine on me!
                                       Dies.
  Ham. Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.
  
  I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!
    You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
  
  That are but mutes or audience to this act,
    Had I but time (as this fell sergeant, Death,
  
  Is strict in his arrest) O, I could tell you-
    But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;
    Thou li
v'st; report me and my cause aright
    To the unsatisfied.
  Hor. Never believe it.
    I am mor
e an antique Roman than a Dane.
    Here's yet some liquor left.
  Ham. As th'art a man,
    Give
 me the cup. Let go! By heaven, I'll ha't.
    O good Horatio, what a wounded name
    (Things sta
nding thus unknown) shall live behind me!
    If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,
    Absent 
thee from felicity awhile,
    And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
    To tell my sto
ry.         [March afar off, and shot within.]
    What warlike noise is this?
  Osr. Young Fortin
bras, with conquest come from Poland,
    To the ambassadors of England gives
    This warlike vol
ley.
  Ham. O, I die, Horatio!
    The potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit.
    I cannot live
 to hear the news from England,
    But I do prophesy th' election lights
    On Fortinbras. He ha
s my dying voice.
    So tell him, with th' occurrents, more and less,
    Which have solicited- t
he rest is silence.             Dies.
  Hor. Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince,
 
   And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
                                                 [M
arch within.]
    Why does the drum come hither?

    Enter Fortinbras and English Ambassadors, w
ith Drum,
                  Colours, and Attendants.

  Fort. Where is this sight?
  Hor. What i
s it you will see?
    If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
  Fort. This quarry cries on 
havoc. O proud Death,
    What feast is toward in thine eternal cell
    That thou so many princes
 at a shot
    So bloodily hast struck.
  Ambassador. The sight is dismal;
    And our affairs fr
om England come too late.
    The ears are senseless that should give us hearing
    To tell him h
is commandment is fulfill'd
    That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.
    Where should we ha
ve our thanks?
  Hor. Not from his mouth,
    Had it th' ability of life to thank you.
    He nev
er gave commandment for their death.
    But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
    You fro
m the Polack wars, and you from England,
    Are here arriv'd, give order that these bodies
    Hi
gh on a stage be placed to the view;
    And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
    How these
 things came about. So shall you hear
    Of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts;
    Of accidental 
judgments, casual slaughters;
    Of deaths put on by cunning and forc'd cause;
    And, in this u
pshot, purposes mistook
    Fall'n on th' inventors' heads. All this can I
    Truly deliver.
  F
ort. Let us haste to hear it,
    And call the noblest to the audience.
    For me, with sorrow I 
embrace my fortune.
    I have some rights of memory in this kingdom
    Which now, to claim my va
ntage doth invite me.
  Hor. Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
    And from his mouth whos
e voice will draw on more.
    But let this same be presently perform'd,
    Even while men's mind
s are wild, lest more mischance
    On plots and errors happen.
  Fort. Let four captains
    Bea
r Hamlet like a soldier to the stage;
    For he was likely, had he been put on,
    To have prov'
d most royally; and for his passage
    The soldiers' music and the rites of war
    Speak loudly 
for him.
    Take up the bodies. Such a sight as this
    Becomes the field but here shows much am
iss.
    Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
            Exeunt marching; after the which a peal of ordnan
ce
                                                   are shot off.

ACT I. Scene I.
Elsinore. A platform before the Castle.

Enter two Sent
inels-[first,] Francisco, [who paces up and down
at his post; then] Bernardo, [who approaches him].


  Ber. Who's there?
  Fran. Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.
  Ber. Long live the Ki
ng!
  Fran. Bernardo?
  Ber. He.
  Fran. You come most carefully upon your hour.
  Ber. 'Tis now
 struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.
  Fran. For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold,

    And I am sick at heart.
  Ber. Have you had quiet guard?
  Fran. Not a mouse stirring.
  Ber
. Well, good night.
    If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
    The rivals of my watch, bid them
 make haste.

                    Enter Horatio and Marcellus.

  Fran. I think I hear them. Sta
nd, ho! Who is there?
  Hor. Friends to this ground.
  Mar. And liegemen to the Dane.
  Fran. Giv
e you good night.
  Mar. O, farewell, honest soldier.
    Who hath reliev'd you?
  Fran. Bernardo
 hath my place.
    Give you good night.                                   Exit.
  Mar. Holla, Ber
nardo!
  Ber. Say-
    What, is Horatio there ?
  Hor. A piece of him.
  Ber. Welcome, Horatio. 
Welcome, good Marcellus.
  Mar. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
  Ber. I have seen n
othing.
  Mar. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
    And will not let belief take hold of him
  
  Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.
    Therefore I have entreated him along,
    Wit
h us to watch the minutes of this night,
    That, if again this apparition come,
    He may appro
ve our eyes and speak to it.
  Hor. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
  Ber. Sit down awhile,
    An
d let us once again assail your ears,
    That are so fortified against our story,
    What we two
 nights have seen.
  Hor. Well, sit we down,
    And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
  Ber. L
ast night of all,
    When yond same star that's westward from the pole
    Had made his course t'
 illume that part of heaven
    Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
    The bell then beatin
g one-

                        Enter Ghost.

  Mar. Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes 
again!
  Ber. In the same figure, like the King that's dead.
  Mar. Thou art a scholar; speak to i
t, Horatio.
  Ber. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.
  Hor. Most like. It harrows me w
ith fear and wonder.
  Ber. It would be spoke to.
  Mar. Question it, Horatio.
  Hor. What art th
ou that usurp'st this time of night
    Together with that fair and warlike form
    In which the 
majesty of buried Denmark
    Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!
  Mar. It is off
ended.
  Ber. See, it stalks away!
  Hor. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!
              
                                       Exit Ghost.
  Mar. 'Tis gone and will not answer.
  Ber. Ho
w now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale.
    Is not this something more than fantasy?
    What t
hink you on't?
  Hor. Before my God, I might not this believe
    Without the sensible and true av
ouch
    Of mine own eyes.
  Mar. Is it not like the King?
  Hor. As thou art to thyself.
    Su
ch was the very armour he had on
    When he th' ambitious Norway combated.
    So frown'd he once
 when, in an angry parle,
    He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
    'Tis strange.
  Mar. T
hus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
    With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
  
Hor. In what particular thought to work I know not;
    But, in the gross and scope of my opinion,

    This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
  Mar. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that 
knows,
    Why this same strict and most observant watch
    So nightly toils the subject of the l
and,
    And why such daily cast of brazen cannon
    And foreign mart for implements of war;
   
 Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
    Does not divide the Sunday from the week.
  
  What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
    Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day?

    Who is't that can inform me?
  Hor. That can I.
    At least, the whisper goes so. Our last 
king,
    Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
    Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,

    Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
    Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Haml
et
    (For so this side of our known world esteem'd him)
    Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a 
seal'd compact,
    Well ratified by law and heraldry,
    Did forfeit, with his life, all those h
is lands
    Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror;
    Against the which a moiety competent

    Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
    To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
    Had he be
en vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant
    And carriage of the article design'd,
    His fell to 
Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
    Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
    Hath in the skirts 
of Norway, here and there,
    Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
    For food and diet, to s
ome enterprise
    That hath a stomach in't; which is no other,
    As it doth well appear unto ou
r state,
    But to recover of us, by strong hand
    And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands

    So by his father lost; and this, I take it,
    Is the main motive of our preparations,
    
The source of this our watch, and the chief head
    Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
  
Ber. I think it be no other but e'en so.
    Well may it sort that this portentous figure
    Come
s armed through our watch, so like the King
    That was and is the question of these wars.
  Hor.
 A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
    In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
    A littl
e ere the mightiest Julius fell,
    The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead
    Did squ
eak and gibber in the Roman streets;
    As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood,
    Disa
sters in the sun; and the moist star
    Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
    Was sick
 almost to doomsday with eclipse.
    And even the like precurse of fierce events,
    As harbinge
rs preceding still the fates
    And prologue to the omen coming on,
    Have heaven and earth tog
ether demonstrated
    Unto our climature and countrymen.

                      Enter Ghost agai
n.

    But soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again!
    I'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay 
illusion!
                                               Spreads his arms.
    If thou hast any so
und, or use of voice,
    Speak to me.
    If there be any good thing to be done,
    That may to
 thee do ease, and, race to me,
    Speak to me.
    If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
   
 Which happily foreknowing may avoid,
    O, speak!
    Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
   
 Extorted treasure in the womb of earth
    (For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death),

                                                 The cock crows.
    Speak of it! Stay, and speak!-
 Stop it, Marcellus!
  Mar. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
  Hor. Do, if it will not stand
.
  Ber. 'Tis here!
  Hor. 'Tis here!
  Mar. 'Tis gone!
                                        
             Exit Ghost.
    We do it wrong, being so majestical,
    To offer it the show of viol
ence;
    For it is as the air, invulnerable,
    And our vain blows malicious mockery.
  Ber. It
 was about to speak, when the cock crew.
  Hor. And then it started, like a guilty thing
    Upon 
a fearful summons. I have heard
    The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
    Doth with his l
ofty and shrill-sounding throat
    Awake the god of day; and at his warning,
    Whether in sea o
r fire, in earth or air,
    Th' extravagant and erring spirit hies
    To his confine; and of the
 truth herein
    This present object made probation.
  Mar. It faded on the crowing of the cock.

    Some say that ever, 'gainst that season comes
    Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,

    The bird of dawning singeth all night long;
    And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,

    The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,
    No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to
 charm,
    So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
  Hor. So have I heard and do in part believe
 it.
    But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
    Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hi
ll.
    Break we our watch up; and by my advice
    Let us impart what we have seen to-night
    
Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
    This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
    Do you c
onsent we shall acquaint him with it,
    As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
    Let's do'
t, I pray; and I this morning know
    Where we shall find him most conveniently.           Exeunt.





Scene II.
Elsinore. A room of state in the Castle.

Flourish. [Enter Claudius, King of 
Denmark, Gertrude the Queen,
Hamlet,
Polonius, Laertes and his sister Ophelia, [Voltemand, Corneli
us,]
Lords Attendant.

  King. Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
    The memory be g
reen, and that it us befitted
    To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom
    To be con
tracted in one brow of woe,
    Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
    That we with wis
est sorrow think on him
    Together with remembrance of ourselves.
    Therefore our sometime sis
ter, now our queen,
    Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,
    Have we, as 'twere with 
a defeated joy,
    With an auspicious, and a dropping eye,
    With mirth in funeral, and with di
rge in marriage,
    In equal scale weighing delight and dole,
    Taken to wife; nor have we here
in barr'd
    Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
    With this affair along. For all, our
 thanks.
    Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
    Holding a weak supposal of our wort
h,
    Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
    Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,

    Colleagued with this dream of his advantage,
    He hath not fail'd to pester us with message

    Importing the surrender of those lands
    Lost by his father, with all bands of law,
    To
 our most valiant brother. So much for him.
    Now for ourself and for this time of meeting.
    
Thus much the business is: we have here writ
    To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,
    Who, im
potent and bedrid, scarcely hears
    Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress
    His further ga
it herein, in that the levies,
    The lists, and full proportions are all made
    Out of his sub
ject; and we here dispatch
    You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,
    For bearers of this gr
eeting to old Norway,
    Giving to you no further personal power
    To business with the King, m
ore than the scope
    Of these dilated articles allow.            [Gives a paper.]
    Farewell, 
and let your haste commend your duty.
  Cor., Volt. In that, and all things, will we show our duty.

  King. We doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell.
                                 Exeunt Voltemand
 and Cornelius.
    And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
    You told us of some suit. What
 is't, Laertes?
    You cannot speak of reason to the Dane
    And lose your voice. What wouldst t
hou beg, Laertes,
    That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
    The head is not more native 
to the heart,
    The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
    Than is the throne of Denmark to th
y father.
    What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
  Laer. My dread lord,
    Your leave and favour t
o return to France;
    From whence though willingly I came to Denmark
    To show my duty in your
 coronation,
    Yet now I must confess, that duty done,
    My thoughts and wishes bend again tow
ard France
    And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
  King. Have you your father's leav
e? What says Polonius?
  Pol. He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
    By laboursome peti
tion, and at last
    Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent.
    I do beseech you give him leave 
to go.
  King. Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,
    And thy best graces spend it at thy
 will!
    But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son-
  Ham. [aside] A little more than kin, and less 
than kind!
  King. How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
  Ham. Not so, my lord. I am too m
uch i' th' sun.
  Queen. Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
    And let thine eye look like
 a friend on Denmark.
    Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
    Seek for thy noble father in th
e dust.
    Thou know'st 'tis common. All that lives must die,
    Passing through nature to etern
ity.
  Ham. Ay, madam, it is common.
  Queen. If it be,
    Why seems it so particular with thee?

  Ham. Seems, madam, Nay, it is. I know not 'seems.'
    'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mothe
r,
    Nor customary suits of solemn black,
    Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,
    No, n
or the fruitful river in the eye,
    Nor the dejected havior of the visage,
    Together with all
 forms, moods, shapes of grief,
    'That can denote me truly. These indeed seem,
    For they are
 actions that a man might play;
    But I have that within which passeth show-
    These but the t
rappings and the suits of woe.
  King. 'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
    To g
ive these mourning duties to your father;
    But you must know, your father lost a father;
    Th
at father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
    In filial obligation for some term
    To do 
obsequious sorrow. But to persever
    In obstinate condolement is a course
    Of impious stubbor
nness. 'Tis unmanly grief;
    It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
    A heart unfortified, 
a mind impatient,
    An understanding simple and unschool'd;
    For what we know must be, and is
 as common
    As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
    Why should we in our peevish opposition

    Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
    A fault against the dead, a fault to nature
,
    To reason most absurd, whose common theme
    Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,

    From the first corse till he that died to-day,
    'This must be so.' We pray you throw to ea
rth
    This unprevailing woe, and think of us
    As of a father; for let the world take note
  
  You are the most immediate to our throne,
    And with no less nobility of love
    Than that wh
ich dearest father bears his son
    Do I impart toward you. For your intent
    In going back to 
school in Wittenberg,
    It is most retrograde to our desire;
    And we beseech you, bend you to
 remain
    Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
    Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our s
on.
  Queen. Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.
    I pray thee stay with us, go not to 
Wittenberg.
  Ham. I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
  King. Why, 'tis a loving and a fair r
eply.
    Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come.
    This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet
  
  Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,
    No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day
    
But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
    And the King's rouse the heaven shall bruit agai
n,
    Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.
                                Flourish. Exeunt all
 but Hamlet.
  Ham. O that this too too solid flesh would melt,
    Thaw, and resolve itself into 
a dew!
    Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
    His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!

    How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
    Seem to me all the uses of this world!
    Fie 
on't! ah, fie! 'Tis an unweeded garden
    That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
   
 Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
    But two months dead! Nay, not so much, not two
.
    So excellent a king, that was to this
    Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
    T
hat he might not beteem the winds of heaven
    Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
    
Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him
    As if increase of appetite had grown
    By what i
t fed on; and yet, within a month-
    Let me not think on't! Frailty, thy name is woman!-
    A l
ittle month, or ere those shoes were old
    With which she followed my poor father's body
    Lik
e Niobe, all tears- why she, even she
    (O God! a beast that wants discourse of reason
    Would
 have mourn'd longer) married with my uncle;
    My father's brother, but no more like my father
 
   Than I to Hercules. Within a month,
    Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
    Had left
 the flushing in her galled eyes,
    She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
    With such dex
terity to incestuous sheets!
    It is not, nor it cannot come to good.
    But break my heart, fo
r I must hold my tongue!

          Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo.

  Hor. Hail to your
 lordship!
  Ham. I am glad to see you well.
    Horatio!- or I do forget myself.
  Hor. The same
, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
  Ham. Sir, my good friend- I'll change that name with you.

    And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?
    Marcellus?
  Mar. My good lord!
  Ham. I am 
very glad to see you.- [To Bernardo] Good even, sir.-

    But what, in faith, make you from Witte
nberg?
  Hor. A truant disposition, good my lord.
  Ham. I would not hear your enemy say so,
    
Nor shall you do my ear that violence
    To make it truster of your own report
    Against yourse
lf. I know you are no truant.
    But what is your affair in Elsinore?
    We'll teach you to drin
k deep ere you depart.
  Hor. My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
  Ham. I prithee do no
t mock me, fellow student.
    I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
  Hor. Indeed, my lord, 
it followed hard upon.
  Ham. Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats
    Did coldly furn
ish forth the marriage tables.
    Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
    Or ever I had seen
 that day, Horatio!
    My father- methinks I see my father.
  Hor. O, where, my lord?
  Ham. In 
my mind's eye, Horatio.
  Hor. I saw him once. He was a goodly king.
  Ham. He was a man, take him
 for all in all.
    I shall not look upon his like again.
  Hor. My lord, I think I saw him yeste
rnight.
  Ham. Saw? who?
  Hor. My lord, the King your father.
  Ham. The King my father?
  Hor.
 Season your admiration for a while
    With an attent ear, till I may deliver
    Upon the witnes
s of these gentlemen,
    This marvel to you.
  Ham. For God's love let me hear!
  Hor. Two night
s together had these gentlemen
    (Marcellus and Bernardo) on their watch
    In the dead vast an
d middle of the night
    Been thus encount'red. A figure like your father,
    Armed at point exa
ctly, cap-a-pe,
    Appears before them and with solemn march
    Goes slow and stately by them. T
hrice he walk'd
    By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
    Within his truncheon's length;
 whilst they distill'd
    Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
    Stand dumb and speak not to h
im. This to me
    In dreadful secrecy impart they did,
    And I with them the third night kept t
he watch;
    Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
    Form of the thing, each word made tr
ue and good,
    The apparition comes. I knew your father.
    These hands are not more like.
  H
am. But where was this?
  Mar. My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
  Ham. Did you not spe
ak to it?
  Hor. My lord, I did;
    But answer made it none. Yet once methought
    It lifted up
 it head and did address
    Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
    But even then the morni
ng cock crew loud,
    And at the sound it shrunk in haste away
    And vanish'd from our sight.

  Ham. 'Tis very strange.
  Hor. As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
    And we did think i
t writ down in our duty
    To let you know of it.
  Ham. Indeed, indeed, sirs. But this troubles 
me.
    Hold you the watch to-night?
  Both [Mar. and Ber.] We do, my lord.
  Ham. Arm'd, say you
?
  Both. Arm'd, my lord.
  Ham. From top to toe?
  Both. My lord, from head to foot.
  Ham. The
n saw you not his face?
  Hor. O, yes, my lord! He wore his beaver up.
  Ham. What, look'd he frow
ningly.
  Hor. A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
  Ham. Pale or red?
  Hor. Nay, very p
ale.
  Ham. And fix'd his eyes upon you?
  Hor. Most constantly.
  Ham. I would I had been there.

  Hor. It would have much amaz'd you.
  Ham. Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
  Hor. While 
one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
  Both. Longer, longer.
  Hor. Not when I saw't.
  
Ham. His beard was grizzled- no?
  Hor. It was, as I have seen it in his life,
    A sable silver'
d.
  Ham. I will watch to-night.
    Perchance 'twill walk again.
  Hor. I warr'nt it will.
  Ha
m. If it assume my noble father's person,
    I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
   
 And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
    If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
    Let 
it be tenable in your silence still;
    And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
    Give it an un
derstanding but no tongue.
    I will requite your loves. So, fare you well.
    Upon the platform
, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
    I'll visit you.
  All. Our duty to your honour.
  Ham. Your loves
, as mine to you. Farewell.
                                        Exeunt [all but Hamlet].
    M
y father's spirit- in arms? All is not well.
    I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come!

    Till then sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,
    Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, 
to men's eyes.
Exit.




Scene III.
Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius.

Enter Laert
es and Ophelia.

  Laer. My necessaries are embark'd. Farewell.
    And, sister, as the winds giv
e benefit
    And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
    But let me hear from you.
  Oph. Do you 
doubt that?
  Laer. For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,
    Hold it a fashion, and a toy i
n blood;
    A violet in the youth of primy nature,
    Forward, not permanent- sweet, not lasting
;
    The perfume and suppliance of a minute;
    No more.
  Oph. No more but so?
  Laer. Think 
it no more.
    For nature crescent does not grow alone
    In thews and bulk; but as this temple 
waxes,
    The inward service of the mind and soul
    Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now
,
    And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
    The virtue of his will; but you must fear,
   
 His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
    For he himself is subject to his birth.
    H
e may not, as unvalued persons do,
    Carve for himself, for on his choice depends
    The safety
 and health of this whole state,
    And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd
    Unto the v
oice and yielding of that body
    Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
    It fi
ts your wisdom so far to believe it
    As he in his particular act and place
    May give his say
ing deed; which is no further
    Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
    Then weigh what 
loss your honour may sustain
    If with too credent ear you list his songs,
    Or lose your hear
t, or your chaste treasure open
    To his unmast'red importunity.
    Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, 
my dear sister,
    And keep you in the rear of your affection,
    Out of the shot and danger of 
desire.
    The chariest maid is prodigal enough
    If she unmask her beauty to the moon.
    Vi
rtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes.
    The canker galls the infants of the spring
    Too 
oft before their buttons be disclos'd,
    And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
    Contagious 
blastments are most imminent.
    Be wary then; best safety lies in fear.
    Youth to itself rebe
ls, though none else near.
  Oph. I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep
    As watchman to m
y heart. But, good my brother,
    Do not as some ungracious pastors do,
    Show me the steep and
 thorny way to heaven,
    Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
    Himself the primrose 
path of dalliance treads
    And recks not his own rede.
  Laer. O, fear me not!

              
         Enter Polonius.

    I stay too long. But here my father comes.
    A double blessing is
 a double grace;
    Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
  Pol. Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard
, for shame!
    The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
    And you are stay'd for. There- my
 blessing with thee!
    And these few precepts in thy memory
    Look thou character. Give thy th
oughts no tongue,
    Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.
    Be thou familiar, but by no mean
s vulgar:
    Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
    Grapple them unto thy soul wi
th hoops of steel;
    But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
    Of each new-hatch'd, unfled
g'd comrade. Beware
    Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,
    Bear't that th' opposed may be
ware of thee.
    Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice;
    Take each man's censure, but re
serve thy judgment.
    Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
    But not express'd in fancy; ric
h, not gaudy;
    For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
    And they in France of the best rank a
nd station
    Are most select and generous, chief in that.
    Neither a borrower nor a lender be
;
    For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
    And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
 
   This above all- to thine own self be true,
    And it must follow, as the night the day,
    Th
ou canst not then be false to any man.
    Farewell. My blessing season this in thee!
  Laer. Most
 humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
  Pol. The time invites you. Go, your servants tend.
  Laer. 
Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well
    What I have said to you.
  Oph. 'Tis in my memory lock'd,

    And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
  Laer. Farewell.                                 
         Exit.
  Pol. What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?
  Oph. So please you, something tou
ching the Lord Hamlet.
  Pol. Marry, well bethought!
    'Tis told me he hath very oft of late
  
  Given private time to you, and you yourself
    Have of your audience been most free and bounteou
s.
    If it be so- as so 'tis put on me,
    And that in way of caution- I must tell you
    You
 do not understand yourself so clearly
    As it behooves my daughter and your honour.
    What is
 between you? Give me up the truth.
  Oph. He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
    Of his 
affection to me.
  Pol. Affection? Pooh! You speak like a green girl,
    Unsifted in such perilou
s circumstance.
    Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
  Oph. I do not know, my lord, w
hat I should think,
  Pol. Marry, I will teach you! Think yourself a baby
    That you have ta'en 
these tenders for true pay,
    Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,
    Or (not t
o crack the wind of the poor phrase,
    Running it thus) you'll tender me a fool.
  Oph. My lord,
 he hath importun'd me with love
    In honourable fashion.
  Pol. Ay, fashion you may call it. Go
 to, go to!
  Oph. And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
    With almost all the holy
 vows of heaven.
  Pol. Ay, springes to catch woodcocks! I do know,
    When the blood burns, how 
prodigal the soul
    Lends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter,
    Giving more light than he
at, extinct in both
    Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
    You must not take for fire. 
From this time
    Be something scanter of your maiden presence.
    Set your entreatments at a hi
gher rate
    Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
    Believe so much in him, that he is yo
ung,
    And with a larger tether may he walk
    Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia,
    Do 
not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
    Not of that dye which their investments show,
    
But mere implorators of unholy suits,
    Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
    The bette
r to beguile. This is for all:
    I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth
    Have you 
so slander any moment leisure
    As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
    Look to't, I 
charge you. Come your ways.
  Oph. I shall obey, my lord.
                                        
                 Exeunt.




Scene IV.
Elsinore. The platform before the Castle.

Enter Haml
et, Horatio, and Marcellus.

  Ham. The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
  Hor. It is a nippi
ng and an eager air.
  Ham. What hour now?
  Hor. I think it lacks of twelve.
  Mar. No, it is st
ruck.
  Hor. Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws near the season
    Wherein the spirit held his
 wont to walk.
                   A flourish of trumpets, and two pieces go off.
    What does thi
s mean, my lord?
  Ham. The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
    Keeps wassail, and th
e swagg'ring upspring reels,
    And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
    The kettledru
m and trumpet thus bray out
    The triumph of his pledge.
  Hor. Is it a custom?
  Ham. Ay, marr
y, is't;
    But to my mind, though I am native here
    And to the manner born, it is a custom
 
   More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
    This heavy-headed revel east and west
    
Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations;
    They clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase
 
   Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
    From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
 
   The pith and marrow of our attribute.
    So oft it chances in particular men
    That, for som
e vicious mole of nature in them,
    As in their birth,- wherein they are not guilty,
    Since n
ature cannot choose his origin,-
    By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
    Oft breaking down t
he pales and forts of reason,
    Or by some habit that too much o'erleavens
    The form of plaus
ive manners, that these men
    Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
    Being nature's liver
y, or fortune's star,
    Their virtues else- be they as pure as grace,
    As infinite as man may
 undergo-
    Shall in the general censure take corruption
    From that particular fault. The dra
m of e'il
    Doth all the noble substance often dout To his own scandal.

                      
   Enter Ghost.

  Hor. Look, my lord, it comes!
  Ham. Angels and ministers of grace defend us!

    Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
    Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts fr
om hell,
    Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
    Thou com'st in such a questionable shape
  
  That I will speak to thee. I'll call thee Hamlet,
    King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me?
  
  Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell
    Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,
    Have 
burst their cerements; why the sepulchre
    Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
    Hath op'd hi
s ponderous and marble jaws
    To cast thee up again. What may this mean
    That thou, dead cors
e, again in complete steel,
    Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
    Making night hideous, 
and we fools of nature
    So horridly to shake our disposition
    With thoughts beyond the reach
es of our souls?
    Say, why is this? wherefore? What should we do?
                             
              Ghost beckons Hamlet.
  Hor. It beckons you to go away with it,
    As if it some im
partment did desire
    To you alone.
  Mar. Look with what courteous action
    It waves you to 
a more removed ground.
    But do not go with it!
  Hor. No, by no means!
  Ham. It will not spea
k. Then will I follow it.
  Hor. Do not, my lord!
  Ham. Why, what should be the fear?
    I do n
ot set my life at a pin's fee;
    And for my soul, what can it do to that,
    Being a thing immo
rtal as itself?
    It waves me forth again. I'll follow it.
  Hor. What if it tempt you toward th
e flood, my lord,
    Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
    That beetles o'er his base into t
he sea,
    And there assume some other, horrible form
    Which might deprive your sovereignty of
 reason
    And draw you into madness? Think of it.
    The very place puts toys of desperation,

    Without more motive, into every brain
    That looks so many fadoms to the sea
    And hears i
t roar beneath.
  Ham. It waves me still.
    Go on. I'll follow thee.
  Mar. You shall not go, m
y lord.
  Ham. Hold off your hands!
  Hor. Be rul'd. You shall not go.
  Ham. My fate cries out

    And makes each petty artire in this body
    As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
            
                                    [Ghost beckons.]

    Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.

    By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!-
    I say, away!- Go on. I'll follow thee.

                                        Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet.
  Hor. He waxes desperate with i
magination.
  Mar. Let's follow. 'Tis not fit thus to obey him.
  Hor. Have after. To what issue w
ill this come?
  Mar. Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
  Hor. Heaven will direct it.

  Mar. Nay, let's follow him.
                                                         Exeunt.





Scene V.
Elsinore. The Castle. Another part of the fortifications.

Enter Ghost and Hamlet.


  Ham. Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak! I'll go no further.
  Ghost. Mark me.
  Ham. I will.

  Ghost. My hour is almost come,
    When I to sulph'rous and tormenting flames
    Must render up
 myself.
  Ham. Alas, poor ghost!
  Ghost. Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
    To what 
I shall unfold.
  Ham. Speak. I am bound to hear.
  Ghost. So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt
 hear.
  Ham. What?
  Ghost. I am thy father's spirit,
    Doom'd for a certain term to walk the 
night,
    And for the day confin'd to fast in fires,
    Till the foul crimes done in my days of 
nature
    Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid
    To tell the secrets of my prison ho
use,
    I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
    Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young 
blood,
    Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
    Thy knotted and combined l
ocks to part,
    And each particular hair to stand on end
    Like quills upon the fretful porcup
ine.
    But this eternal blazon must not be
    To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!

    If thou didst ever thy dear father love-
  Ham. O God!
  Ghost. Revenge his foul and most unn
atural murther.
  Ham. Murther?
  Ghost. Murther most foul, as in the best it is;
    But this mo
st foul, strange, and unnatural.
  Ham. Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
    As med
itation or the thoughts of love,
    May sweep to my revenge.
  Ghost. I find thee apt;
    And d
uller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
    That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
    Wouldst 
thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.
    'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
    A s
erpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark
    Is by a forged process of my death
    Rankly abu
s'd. But know, thou noble youth,
    The serpent that did sting thy father's life
    Now wears hi
s crown.
  Ham. O my prophetic soul!
    My uncle?
  Ghost. Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate 
beast,
    With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts-
    O wicked wit and gifts, that hav
e the power
    So to seduce!- won to his shameful lust
    The will of my most seeming-virtuous q
ueen.
    O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there,
    From me, whose love was of that dignity
   
 That it went hand in hand even with the vow
    I made to her in marriage, and to decline
    Upo
n a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
    To those of mine!
    But virtue, as it never will be
 mov'd,
    Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
    So lust, though to a radiant angel 
link'd,
    Will sate itself in a celestial bed
    And prey on garbage.
    But soft! methinks I
 scent the morning air.
    Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
    My custom always of t
he afternoon,
    Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
    With juice of cursed hebona in a vial,

    And in the porches of my ears did pour
    The leperous distilment; whose effect
    Holds su
ch an enmity with blood of man
    That swift as quicksilver it courses through
    The natural ga
tes and alleys of the body,
    And with a sudden vigour it doth posset
    And curd, like eager d
roppings into milk,
    The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine;
    And a most instant tette
r bark'd about,
    Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust
    All my smooth body.
    Th
us was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
    Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd;
    C
ut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
    Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd,
    No reckoning ma
de, but sent to my account
    With all my imperfections on my head.
  Ham. O, horrible! O, horrib
le! most horrible!
  Ghost. If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.
    Let not the royal bed of
 Denmark be
    A couch for luxury and damned incest.
    But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,

    Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
    Against thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven
,
    And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge
    To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at on
ce.
    The glowworm shows the matin to be near
    And gins to pale his uneffectual fire.
    Ad
ieu, adieu, adieu! Remember me.                      Exit.

  Ham. O all you host of heaven! O ear
th! What else?
    And shall I couple hell? Hold, hold, my heart!
    And you, my sinews, grow not
 instant old,
    But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?
    Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory hol
ds a seat
    In this distracted globe. Remember thee?
    Yea, from the table of my memory
    I
'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
    All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past
    T
hat youth and observation copied there,
    And thy commandment all alone shall live
    Within th
e book and volume of my brain,
    Unmix'd with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!
    O most perniciou
s woman!
    O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
    My tables! Meet it is I set it down

    That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
    At least I am sure it may be so in Denmar
k.        [Writes.]
    So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word:
    It is 'Adieu, adieu! Remembe
r me.'
    I have sworn't.
  Hor. (within) My lord, my lord!

                   Enter Horatio a
nd Marcellus.

  Mar. Lord Hamlet!
  Hor. Heaven secure him!
  Ham. So be it!
  Mar. Illo, ho, 
ho, my lord!
  Ham. Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.
  Mar. How is't, my noble lord?
  Hor. 
What news, my lord?
  Mar. O, wonderful!
  Hor. Good my lord, tell it.
  Ham. No, you will reveal
 it.
  Hor. Not I, my lord, by heaven!
  Mar. Nor I, my lord.
  Ham. How say you then? Would hear
t of man once think it?
    But you'll be secret?
  Both. Ay, by heaven, my lord.
  Ham. There's 
neer a villain dwelling in all Denmark
    But he's an arrant knave.
  Hor. There needs no ghost, 
my lord, come from the grave
    To tell us this.
  Ham. Why, right! You are in the right!
    An
d so, without more circumstance at all,
    I hold it fit that we shake hands and part;
    You, a
s your business and desires shall point you,
    For every man hath business and desire,
    Such 
as it is; and for my own poor part,
    Look you, I'll go pray.
  Hor. These are but wild and whir
ling words, my lord.
  Ham. I am sorry they offend you, heartily;
    Yes, faith, heartily.
  Hor
. There's no offence, my lord.
  Ham. Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
    And much o
ffence too. Touching this vision here,
    It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.
    For yo
ur desire to know what is between us,
    O'ermaster't as you may. And now, good friends,
    As y
ou are friends, scholars, and soldiers,
    Give me one poor request.
  Hor. What is't, my lord? W
e will.
  Ham. Never make known what you have seen to-night.
  Both. My lord, we will not.
  Ham.
 Nay, but swear't.
  Hor. In faith,
    My lord, not I.
  Mar. Nor I, my lord- in faith.
  Ham. 
Upon my sword.
  Mar. We have sworn, my lord, already.
  Ham. Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.

  
               Ghost cries under the stage.

  Ghost. Swear.
  Ham. Aha boy, say'st thou so? Art 
thou there, truepenny?
    Come on! You hear this fellow in the cellarage.
    Consent to swear.

  Hor. Propose the oath, my lord.
  Ham. Never to speak of this that you have seen.
    Swear by m
y sword.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
  Ham. Hic et ubique? Then we'll shift our ground.
    Come hi
ther, gentlemen,
    And lay your hands again upon my sword.
    Never to speak of this that you h
ave heard:
    Swear by my sword.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear by his sword.
  Ham. Well said, old mo
le! Canst work i' th' earth so fast?
    A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends."
  Hor. 
O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
  Ham. And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.

    There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
    Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.

    But come!
    Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
    How strange or odd soe'er I bea
r myself
    (As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
    To put an antic disposition on),
    
That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
    With arms encumb'red thus, or this head-shake,

    Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
    As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if w
e would,'
    Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'
    Or such ambiguous giv
ing out, to note
    That you know aught of me- this is not to do,
    So grace and mercy at your 
most need help you,
    Swear.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
                                        
           [They swear.]
  Ham. Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! So, gentlemen,
    With all my love 
I do commend me to you;
    And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
    May do t' express his love and
 friending to you,
    God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;
    And still your fing
ers on your lips, I pray.
    The time is out of joint. O cursed spite
    That ever I was born to
 set it right!
    Nay, come, let's go together.
                                                 
        Exeunt.

Act II. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius.


Enter Polonius and Reynaldo.

  Pol. Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
  Rey. I wil
l, my lord.
  Pol. You shall do marvell's wisely, good Reynaldo,
    Before You visit him, to make
 inquire
    Of his behaviour.
  Rey. My lord, I did intend it.
  Pol. Marry, well said, very wel
l said. Look you, sir,
    Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
    And how, and who, what
 means, and where they keep,
    What company, at what expense; and finding
    By this encompassm
ent and drift of question
    That they do know my son, come you more nearer
    Than your particu
lar demands will touch it.
    Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
    As thus, 'I
 know his father and his friends,
    And in part him.' Do you mark this, Reynaldo?
  Rey. Ay, ver
y well, my lord.
  Pol. 'And in part him, but,' you may say, 'not well.
    But if't be he I mean,
 he's very wild
    Addicted so and so'; and there put on him
    What forgeries you please; marry
, none so rank
    As may dishonour him- take heed of that;
    But, sir, such wanton, wild, and u
sual slips
    As are companions noted and most known
    To youth and liberty.
  Rey. As gaming,
 my lord.
  Pol. Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
    Drabbing. You may go so far.

  Rey. My lord, that would dishonour him.
  Pol. Faith, no, as you may season it in the charge.

    You must not put another scandal on him,
    That he is open to incontinency.
    That's not m
y meaning. But breathe his faults so quaintly
    That they may seem the taints of liberty,
    Th
e flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
    A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
    Of general assaul
t.
  Rey. But, my good lord-
  Pol. Wherefore should you do this?
  Rey. Ay, my lord,
    I woul
d know that.
  Pol. Marry, sir, here's my drift,
    And I believe it is a fetch of warrant.
    
You laying these slight sullies on my son
    As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' th' working,
  
  Mark you,
    Your party in converse, him you would sound,
    Having ever seen in the prenomina
te crimes
    The youth you breathe of guilty, be assur'd
    He closes with you in this consequen
ce:
    'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman'-
    According to the phrase or the additio
n
    Of man and country-
  Rey. Very good, my lord.
  Pol. And then, sir, does 'a this- 'a does-
 What was I about to
say?
    By the mass, I was about to say something! Where did I leave?
  Rey
. At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,' and
    gentleman.'
  Pol. At 'closes in the 
consequence'- Ay, marry!
    He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman.
    I saw him yesterday, or t'
other day,
    Or then, or then, with such or such; and, as you say,
    There was 'a gaming; ther
e o'ertook in's rouse;
    There falling out at tennis'; or perchance,
    'I saw him enter such a
 house of sale,'
    Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
    See you now-
    Your bait of falseho
od takes this carp of truth;
    And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
    With windlasses and wi
th assays of bias,
    By indirections find directions out.
    So, by my former lecture and advic
e,
    Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?
  Rey. My lord, I have.
  Pol. God b' wi' ye,
 fare ye well!
  Rey. Good my lord!                                    [Going.]
  Pol. Observe his
 inclination in yourself.
  Rey. I shall, my lord.
  Pol. And let him ply his music.
  Rey. Well,
 my lord.
  Pol. Farewell!
                                                  Exit Reynaldo.

   
                    Enter Ophelia.

    How now, Ophelia? What's the matter?
  Oph. O my lord, my
 lord, I have been so affrighted!
  Pol. With what, i' th' name of God?
  Oph. My lord, as I was s
ewing in my closet,
    Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac'd,
    No hat upon his head, his 
stockings foul'd,
    Ungart'red, and down-gyved to his ankle;
    Pale as his shirt, his knees kn
ocking each other,
    And with a look so piteous in purport
    As if he had been loosed out of h
ell
    To speak of horrors- he comes before me.
  Pol. Mad for thy love?
  Oph. My lord, I do no
t know,
    But truly I do fear it.
  Pol. What said he?
  Oph. He took me by the wrist and held 
me hard;
    Then goes he to the length of all his arm,
    And, with his other hand thus o'er his
 brow,
    He falls to such perusal of my face
    As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so.
    At
 last, a little shaking of mine arm,
    And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
    He rais'
d a sigh so piteous and profound
    As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
    And end his being.
 That done, he lets me go,
    And with his head over his shoulder turn'd
    He seem'd to find hi
s way without his eyes,
    For out o' doors he went without their help
    And to the last bended
 their light on me.
  Pol. Come, go with me. I will go seek the King.
    This is the very ecstasy
 of love,
    Whose violent property fordoes itself
    And leads the will to desperate undertakin
gs
    As oft as any passion under heaven
    That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
    What
, have you given him any hard words of late?
  Oph. No, my good lord; but, as you did command,
   
 I did repel his letters and denied
    His access to me.
  Pol. That hath made him mad.
    I am
 sorry that with better heed and judgment
    I had not quoted him. I fear'd he did but trifle
   
 And meant to wrack thee; but beshrew my jealousy!
    By heaven, it is as proper to our age
    T
o cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
    As it is common for the younger sort
    To lack discr
etion. Come, go we to the King.
    This must be known; which, being kept close, might move
    Mo
re grief to hide than hate to utter love.
    Come.
                                              
           Exeunt.

Scene II.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Flourish. [Enter King and Queen,
 Rosencrantz and Guildenstern,
cum aliis.

  King. Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
 
   Moreover that we much did long to see you,
    The need we have to use you did provoke
    Our 
hasty sending. Something have you heard
    Of Hamlet's transformation. So I call it,
    Sith nor
 th' exterior nor the inward man
    Resembles that it was. What it should be,
    More than his f
ather's death, that thus hath put him
    So much from th' understanding of himself,
    I cannot 
dream of. I entreat you both
    That, being of so young days brought up with him,
    And since s
o neighbour'd to his youth and haviour,
    That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
    Som
e little time; so by your companies
    To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather
    So much as 
from occasion you may glean,
    Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus
    That, open'd, l
ies within our remedy.
  Queen. Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,
    And sure I am two 
men there are not living
    To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
    To show us so much
 gentry and good will
    As to expend your time with us awhile
    For the supply and profit of o
ur hope,
    Your visitation shall receive such thanks
    As fits a king's remembrance.
  Ros. B
oth your Majesties
    Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
    Put your dread pleasures 
more into command
    Than to entreaty.
  Guil. But we both obey,
    And here give up ourselves,
 in the full bent,
    To lay our service freely at your feet,
    To be commanded.
  King. Thank
s, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
  Queen. Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz.
    
And I beseech you instantly to visit
    My too much changed son.- Go, some of you,
    And bring 
these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
  Guil. Heavens make our presence and our practices
    Pleasant 
and helpful to him!
  Queen. Ay, amen!
                 Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, [with
 some
                                                    Attendants].

                         
Enter Polonius.

  Pol. Th' ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
    Are joyfully return'd.
  
King. Thou still hast been the father of good news.
  Pol. Have I, my lord? Assure you, my good lie
ge,
    I hold my duty as I hold my soul,
    Both to my God and to my gracious king;
    And I d
o think- or else this brain of mine
    Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
    As it hath us'd 
to do- that I have found
    The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
  King. O, speak of that! That do 
I long to hear.
  Pol. Give first admittance to th' ambassadors.
    My news shall be the fruit to
 that great feast.
  King. Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
                          
                      [Exit Polonius.]
    He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found
    The he
ad and source of all your son's distemper.
  Queen. I doubt it is no other but the main,
    His f
ather's death and our o'erhasty marriage.
  King. Well, we shall sift him.

              Enter P
olonius, Voltemand, and Cornelius.

    Welcome, my good friends.
    Say, Voltemand, what from o
ur brother Norway?
  Volt. Most fair return of greetings and desires.
    Upon our first, he sent 
out to suppress
    His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
    To be a preparation 'gainst the
 Polack,
    But better look'd into, he truly found
    It was against your Highness; whereat grie
v'd,
    That so his sickness, age, and impotence
    Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests

    On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys,
    Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,
   
 Makes vow before his uncle never more
    To give th' assay of arms against your Majesty.
    Whe
reon old Norway, overcome with joy,
    Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee
    And his 
commission to employ those soldiers,
    So levied as before, against the Polack;
    With an entr
eaty, herein further shown,
                                                [Gives a paper.]
    T
hat it might please you to give quiet pass
    Through your dominions for this enterprise,
    On 
such regards of safety and allowance
    As therein are set down.
  King. It likes us well;
    A
nd at our more consider'd time we'll read,
    Answer, and think upon this business.
    Meantime 
we thank you for your well-took labour.
    Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together.
    Mo
st welcome home!                       Exeunt Ambassadors.
  Pol. This business is well ended.
   
 My liege, and madam, to expostulate
    What majesty should be, what duty is,
    Why day is day,
 night is night, and time is time.
    Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time.
    Therefo
re, since brevity is the soul of wit,
    And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
    I 
will be brief. Your noble son is mad.
    Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,
    What is'
t but to be nothing else but mad?
    But let that go.
  Queen. More matter, with less art.
  Pol
. Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
    That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
    And 
pity 'tis 'tis true. A foolish figure!
    But farewell it, for I will use no art.
    Mad let us 
grant him then. And now remains
    That we find out the cause of this effect-
    Or rather say, 
the cause of this defect,
    For this effect defective comes by cause.
    Thus it remains, and t
he remainder thus.
    Perpend.
    I have a daughter (have while she is mine),
    Who in her du
ty and obedience, mark,
    Hath given me this. Now gather, and surmise.
                         
                    [Reads] the letter.
    'To the celestial, and my soul's idol, the most beautif
ied
      Ophelia,'-

    That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is a vile
      phra
se.
    But you shall hear. Thus:
                                                        [Reads.]

    'In her excellent white bosom, these, &c.'
  Queen. Came this from Hamlet to her?
  Pol. Goo
d madam, stay awhile. I will be faithful.     [Reads.]


          'Doubt thou the stars are fire
;
            Doubt that the sun doth move;
          Doubt truth to be a liar;
            But n
ever doubt I love.
      'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers; I have not art
to
    reckon
 my groans; but that I love thee best, O most best,
believe
    it. Adieu.
      'Thine evermore,
 most dear lady, whilst this machine is to
him,

HAMLET.'

    This, in obedience, hath my daug
hter shown me;
    And more above, hath his solicitings,
    As they fell out by time, by means, a
nd place,
    All given to mine ear.
  King. But how hath she
    Receiv'd his love?
  Pol. What
 do you think of me?
  King. As of a man faithful and honourable.
  Pol. I would fain prove so. Bu
t what might you think,
    When I had seen this hot love on the wing
    (As I perceiv'd it, I mu
st tell you that,
    Before my daughter told me), what might you,
    Or my dear Majesty your que
en here, think,
    If I had play'd the desk or table book,
    Or given my heart a winking, mute 
and dumb,
    Or look'd upon this love with idle sight?
    What might you think? No, I went round
 to work
    And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
    'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy st
ar.
    This must not be.' And then I prescripts gave her,
    That she should lock herself from h
is resort,
    Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
    Which done, she took the fruits of my a
dvice,
    And he, repulsed, a short tale to make,
    Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
   
 Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
    Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
  
  Into the madness wherein now he raves,
    And all we mourn for.
  King. Do you think 'tis this?

  Queen. it may be, very like.
  Pol. Hath there been such a time- I would fain know that-
    T
hat I have Positively said ''Tis so,'
    When it prov'd otherwise.?
  King. Not that I know.
  P
ol. [points to his head and shoulder] Take this from this, if
this
      be otherwise.
    If cir
cumstances lead me, I will find
    Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
    Within the c
entre.
  King. How may we try it further?
  Pol. You know sometimes he walks for hours together
 
   Here in the lobby.
  Queen. So he does indeed.
  Pol. At such a time I'll loose my daughter to 
him.
    Be you and I behind an arras then.
    Mark the encounter. If he love her not,
    And h
e not from his reason fall'n thereon
    Let me be no assistant for a state,
    But keep a farm a
nd carters.
  King. We will try it.

                 Enter Hamlet, reading on a book.

  Queen
. But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
  Pol. Away, I do beseech you, both away
   
 I'll board him presently. O, give me leave.
                       Exeunt King and Queen, [with At
tendants].
    How does my good Lord Hamlet?
  Ham. Well, God-a-mercy.
  Pol. Do you know me, my 
lord?
  Ham. Excellent well. You are a fishmonger.
  Pol. Not I, my lord.
  Ham. Then I would you
 were so honest a man.
  Pol. Honest, my lord?
  Ham. Ay, sir. To be honest, as this world goes, i
s to be one
man
    pick'd out of ten thousand.
  Pol. That's very true, my lord.
  Ham. For if 
the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god
    kissing carrion- Have you a daughter?
  Pol. 
I have, my lord.
  Ham. Let her not walk i' th' sun. Conception is a blessing, but
not
    as you
r daughter may conceive. Friend, look to't.
  Pol. [aside] How say you by that? Still harping on my
 daughter.
Yet
    he knew me not at first. He said I was a fishmonger. He is
far
    gone, far 
gone! And truly in my youth I suff'red much
extremity
    for love- very near this. I'll speak to 
him again.- What do
you
    read, my lord?
  Ham. Words, words, words.
  Pol. What is the matter
, my lord?
  Ham. Between who?
  Pol. I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
  Ham. Slanders,
 sir; for the satirical rogue says here that old
men
    have grey beards; that their faces are wr
inkled; their eyes
    purging thick amber and plum-tree gum; and that they have a
    plentiful l
ack of wit, together with most weak hams. All
which,
    sir, though I most powerfully and potentl
y believe, yet I
hold it
    not honesty to have it thus set down; for you yourself, sir,
    sho
uld be old as I am if, like a crab, you could go backward.

  Pol. [aside] Though this be madness,
 yet there is a method
in't.-
   Will You walk out of the air, my lord?
  Ham. Into my grave?
  
Pol. Indeed, that is out o' th' air. [Aside] How pregnant
sometimes
    his replies are! a happine
ss that often madness hits on,
which
    reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered 
of.
I
    will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting
between
    him and my daugh
ter.- My honourable lord, I will most humbly
take
    my leave of you.
  Ham. You cannot, sir, ta
ke from me anything that I will more
    willingly part withal- except my life, except my life, exc
ept
my
    life,

                    Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Pol. Fare you wel
l, my lord.
  Ham. These tedious old fools!
  Pol. You go to seek the Lord Hamlet. There he is.
 
 Ros. [to Polonius] God save you, sir!
                                                Exit [Poloni
us].

  Guil. My honour'd lord!
  Ros. My most dear lord!
  Ham. My excellent good friends! How 
dost thou, Guildenstern?
Ah,
    Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
  Ros. As the indifferen
t children of the earth.
  Guil. Happy in that we are not over-happy.
    On Fortune's cap we are 
not the very button.
  Ham. Nor the soles of her shoe?
  Ros. Neither, my lord.
  Ham. Then you l
ive about her waist, or in the middle of her
    favours?
  Guil. Faith, her privates we.
  Ham. 
In the secret parts of Fortune? O! most true! she is a
    strumpet. What news ?
  Ros. None, my l
ord, but that the world's grown honest.
  Ham. Then is doomsday near! But your news is not true. Le
t me
    question more in particular. What have you, my good friends,
    deserved at the hands of
 Fortune that she sends you to prison
    hither?
  Guil. Prison, my lord?
  Ham. Denmark's a pri
son.
  Ros. Then is the world one.
  Ham. A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, a
nd
    dungeons, Denmark being one o' th' worst.
  Ros. We think not so, my lord.
  Ham. Why, the
n 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either
good
    or bad but thinking makes it so. To me it
 is a prison.
  Ros. Why, then your ambition makes it one. 'Tis too narrow for
your
    mind.
  
Ham. O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a
    king of infinite space, were it
 not that I have bad dreams.
  Guil. Which dreams indeed are ambition; for the very substance
of

    the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
  Ham. A dream itself is but a shadow.
  Ros. T
ruly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality
that
    it is but a shadow's shadow.
  
Ham. Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and
outstretch'd
    heroes the beggars' shadow
s. Shall we to th' court? for, by
my
    fay, I cannot reason.
  Both. We'll wait upon you.
  Ha
m. No such matter! I will not sort you with the rest of my
    servants; for, to speak to you like 
an honest man, I am most
    dreadfully attended. But in the beaten way of friendship,
what
    m
ake you at Elsinore?
  Ros. To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
  Ham. Beggar that I am, I a
m even poor in thanks; but I thank
you;
    and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfp
enny.
Were
    you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free
    visitation? Come, dea
l justly with me. Come, come! Nay,
speak.
  Guil. What should we say, my lord?
  Ham. Why, anythi
ng- but to th' purpose. You were sent for; and
    there is a kind of confession in your looks, whi
ch your
modesties
    have not craft enough to colour. I know the good King and
Queen
    have s
ent for you.
  Ros. To what end, my lord?
  Ham. That you must teach me. But let me conjure you by
 the
rights
    of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the
    obligation of our e
ver-preserved love, and by what more dear
a
    better proposer could charge you withal, be even a
nd direct
with
    me, whether you were sent for or no.
  Ros. [aside to Guildenstern] What say y
ou?
  Ham. [aside] Nay then, I have an eye of you.- If you love me,
hold
    not off.
  Guil. My
 lord, we were sent for.
  Ham. I will tell you why. So shall my anticipation prevent your
    dis
covery, and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no
    feather. I have of late- but wherefore 
I know not- lost all
my
    mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes
so
    h
eavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the
earth,
    seems to me a sterile promontory
; this most excellent canopy,
the
    air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this
majes
tical
    roof fretted with golden fire- why, it appeareth no other
thing
    to me than a foul a
nd pestilent congregation of vapours. What
a
    piece of work is a man! how noble in reason! how 
infinite in
    faculties! in form and moving how express and admirable! in
    action how like an
 angel! in apprehension how like a god! the
    beauty of the world, the paragon of animals! And ye
t to me
what
    is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me- no, nor
woman
    neither, t
hough by your smiling you seem to say so.
  Ros. My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.

  Ham. Why did you laugh then, when I said 'Man delights not me'?
  Ros. To think, my lord, if you 
delight not in man, what lenten
    entertainment the players shall receive from you. We coted
the
m
    on the way, and hither are they coming to offer you service.
  Ham. He that plays the king s
hall be welcome- his Majesty shall
    have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foi
l
and
    target; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humorous man
shall
    end his part in pe
ace; the clown shall make those laugh whose
    lungs are tickle o' th' sere; and the lady shall sa
y her mind
    freely, or the blank verse shall halt for't. What players are
    they?
  Ros. Eve
n those you were wont to take such delight in, the
    tragedians of the city.
  Ham. How chances 
it they travel? Their residence, both in
    reputation and profit, was better both ways.
  Ros. I
 think their inhibition comes by the means of the late
    innovation.
  Ham. Do they hold the sam
e estimation they did when I was in
the
    city? Are they so follow'd?
  Ros. No indeed are they
 not.
  Ham. How comes it? Do they grow rusty?
  Ros. Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pac
e; but there
is,
    sir, an eyrie of children, little eyases, that cry out on the
top
    of qu
estion and are most tyrannically clapp'd for't. These
are now
    the fashion, and so berattle the
 common stages (so they call
    them) that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goosequills and
   
 dare scarce come thither.
  Ham. What, are they children? Who maintains 'em? How are they
    esc
oted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can
    sing? Will they not say afterwards, 
if they should grow
    themselves to common players (as it is most like, if their
means
    are 
no better), their writers do them wrong to make them
exclaim
    against their own succession.
  
Ros. Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the
nation
    holds it no sin to tarre t
hem to controversy. There was, for
a
    while, no money bid for argument unless the poet and the

player
    went to cuffs in the question.
  Ham. Is't possible?
  Guil. O, there has been much t
hrowing about of brains.
  Ham. Do the boys carry it away?
  Ros. Ay, that they do, my lord- Hercu
les and his load too.
  Ham. It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark,
and
    tho
se that would make mows at him while my father lived give
    twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducat
s apiece for his picture
in
    little. 'Sblood, there is something in this more than
natural, if

    philosophy could find it out.

                     Flourish for the Players.

  Guil. The
re are the players.
  Ham. Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come!
Th'
    appu
rtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me
comply
    with you in this garb, lest my exte
nt to the players (which I
    tell you must show fairly outwards) should more appear like
    ent
ertainment than yours. You are welcome. But my
uncle-father
    and aunt-mother are deceiv'd.
  G
uil. In what, my dear lord?
  Ham. I am but mad north-north-west. When the wind is southerly
I
  
  know a hawk from a handsaw.

                            Enter Polonius.

  Pol. Well be with 
you, gentlemen!
  Ham. Hark you, Guildenstern- and you too- at each ear a hearer!
    That great b
aby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling
    clouts.
  Ros. Happily he's the second time 
come to them; for they say an
old
    man is twice a child.
  Ham. I will prophesy he comes to te
ll me of the players. Mark
it.-
   You say right, sir; a Monday morning; twas so indeed.
  Pol. M
y lord, I have news to tell you.
  Ham. My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an
acto
r in
    Rome-
  Pol. The actors are come hither, my lord.
  Ham. Buzz, buzz!
  Pol. Upon my hon
our-
  Ham. Then came each actor on his ass-
  Pol. The best actors in the world, either for trage
dy, comedy,
    history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral,
    tragical-historical,
 tragical-comical-historical-pastoral;
scene
    individable, or poem unlimited. Seneca cannot be 
too heavy,
nor
    Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these
are
    the onl
y men.
  Ham. O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
  Pol. What treasure had he
, my lord?
  Ham. Why,

         'One fair daughter, and no more,
           The which he loved 
passing well.'

  Pol. [aside] Still on my daughter.
  Ham. Am I not i' th' right, old Jephthah?

  Pol. If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I
    love passing well.
  Ham. N
ay, that follows not.
  Pol. What follows then, my lord?
  Ham. Why,

           'As by lot, God
 wot,'

 and then, you know,

           'It came to pass, as most like it was.'

    The firs
t row of the pious chanson will show you more; for
look
    where my abridgment comes.

        
             Enter four or five Players.

    You are welcome, masters; welcome, all.- I am glad t
o see
thee
    well.- Welcome, good friends.- O, my old friend? Why, thy
face is
    valanc'd si
nce I saw thee last. Com'st' thou to' beard me in
    Denmark?- What, my young lady and mistress? B
y'r Lady, your
    ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last by the
    altitude of a 
chopine. Pray God your voice, like a piece of
    uncurrent gold, be not crack'd within the ring.- 
Masters, you
are
    all welcome. We'll e'en to't like French falconers, fly at
    anything we s
ee. We'll have a speech straight. Come, give us
a
    taste of your quality. Come, a passionate sp
eech.
  1. Play. What speech, my good lord?
  Ham. I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was
 never
acted;
    or if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember,
pleas'd
    not the mi
llion, 'twas caviary to the general; but it was (as
I
    receiv'd it, and others, whose judgments
 in such matters
cried in
    the top of mine) an excellent play, well digested in the
scenes,
 
   set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember one said
    there were no sallets in the l
ines to make the matter
savoury,
    nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of

    affectation; but call'd it an honest method, as wholesome as
    sweet, and by very much more h
andsome than fine. One speech
in't
    I chiefly lov'd. 'Twas AEneas' tale to Dido, and thereabout

of it
    especially where he speaks of Priam's slaughter. If it live
in
    your memory, begin
 at this line- let me see, let me see:

         'The rugged Pyrrhus, like th' Hyrcanian beast-'


    'Tis not so; it begins with Pyrrhus:

         'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
  
       Black as his purpose, did the night resemble
         When he lay couched in the ominous hor
se,
         Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd
         With heraldry more dismal. 
Head to foot
         Now is be total gules, horridly trick'd
         With blood of fathers, moth
ers, daughters, sons,
         Bak'd and impasted with the parching streets,
         That lend a 
tyrannous and a damned light
         To their lord's murther. Roasted in wrath and fire,
        
 And thus o'ersized with coagulate gore,
         With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
 
        Old grandsire Priam seeks.'

    So, proceed you.
  Pol. Fore God, my lord, well spoken, 
with good accent and good
     discretion.

  1. Play. 'Anon he finds him,
      Striking too sh
ort at Greeks. His antique sword,
      Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
      Repugnan
t to command. Unequal match'd,
      Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide;
      But with
 the whiff and wind of his fell sword
      Th' unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
     
 Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
      Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
  
    Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear. For lo! his sword,
      Which was declining on the milky head
  
    Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' th' air to stick.
      So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
 
     And, like a neutral to his will and matter,
      Did nothing.
      But, as we often see, ag
ainst some storm,
      A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
      The bold winds speec
hless, and the orb below
      As hush as death- anon the dreadful thunder
      Doth rend the reg
ion; so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
      Aroused vengeance sets him new awork;
      And never did the
 Cyclops' hammers fall
      On Mars's armour, forg'd for proof eterne,
      With less remorse th
an Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
      Now falls on Priam.
      Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All yo
u gods,
      In general synod take away her power;
      Break all the spokes and fellies from he
r wheel,
      And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
      As low as to the fiends!


  Pol. This is too long.
  Ham. It shall to the barber's, with your beard.- Prithee say
on.
    H
e's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps. Say on;
come to
    Hecuba.

  1. Play. 'But wh
o, O who, had seen the mobled queen-'

  Ham. 'The mobled queen'?
  Pol. That's good! 'Mobled que
en' is good.

  1. Play. 'Run barefoot up and down, threat'ning the flames
      With bisson rheu
m; a clout upon that head
      Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
      About her lank 
and all o'erteemed loins,
      A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up-
      Who this had seen
, with tongue in venom steep'd
      'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have pronounc'd.
      
But if the gods themselves did see her then,
      When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
     
 In Mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,
      The instant burst of clamour that she made
 
     (Unless things mortal move them not at all)
      Would have made milch the burning eyes of he
aven
      And passion in the gods.'

  Pol. Look, whe'r he has not turn'd his colour, and has te
ars
in's
    eyes. Prithee no more!
  Ham. 'Tis well. I'll have thee speak out the rest of this

soon.-
    Good my lord, will you see the players well bestow'd? Do you
    hear? Let them be well
 us'd; for they are the abstract and
brief
    chronicles of the time. After your death you were b
etter have
a
    bad epitaph than their ill report while you live.
  Pol. My lord, I will use the
m according to their desert.
  Ham. God's bodykins, man, much better! Use every man after his
    
desert, and who should scape whipping? Use them after your
own
    honour and dignity. The less th
ey deserve, the more merit is
in
    your bounty. Take them in.
  Pol. Come, sirs.
  Ham. Follow
 him, friends. We'll hear a play to-morrow.
                 Exeunt Polonius and Players [except th
e First].
    Dost thou hear me, old friend? Can you play 'The Murther of
    Gonzago'?
  1. Play
. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need, study a
    speech of som
e dozen or sixteen lines which I would set down
and
    insert in't, could you not?
  1. Play. Ay
, my lord.
  Ham. Very well. Follow that lord- and look you mock him not.
                        
                    [Exit First Player.]
    My good friends, I'll leave you till night. You are we
lcome
to
    Elsinore.
  Ros. Good my lord!
  Ham. Ay, so, God b' wi' ye!
                     
       [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
    Now I am alone.
    O what a rogue and peasant sla
ve am I!
    Is it not monstrous that this player here,
    But in a fiction, in a dream of passio
n,
    Could force his soul so to his own conceit
    That, from her working, all his visage wann'
d,
    Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
    A broken voice, and his whole function suit
ing
    With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!
    For Hecuba!
    What's Hecuba to him,
 or he to Hecuba,
    That he should weep for her? What would he do,
    Had he the motive and the
 cue for passion
    That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
    And cleave the general e
ar with horrid speech;
    Make mad the guilty and appal the free,
    Confound the ignorant, and 
amaze indeed
    The very faculties of eyes and ears.
    Yet I,
    A dull and muddy-mettled ras
cal, peak
    Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
    And can say nothing! No, not for a k
ing,
    Upon whose property and most dear life
    A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
    
Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
    Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?
    
Tweaks me by th' nose? gives me the lie i' th' throat
    As deep as to the lungs? Who does me this
, ha?
    'Swounds, I should take it! for it cannot be
    But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall

    To make oppression bitter, or ere this
    I should have fatted all the region kites
    With 
this slave's offal. Bloody bawdy villain!
    Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain
!
    O, vengeance!
    Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
    That I, the son of a dear 
father murther'd,
    Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
    Must (like a whore) unpack my
 heart with words
    And fall a-cursing like a very drab,
    A scullion!
    Fie upon't! foh! A
bout, my brain! Hum, I have heard
    That guilty creatures, sitting at a play,
    Have by the ve
ry cunning of the scene
    Been struck so to the soul that presently
    They have proclaim'd the
ir malefactions;
    For murther, though it have no tongue, will speak
    With most miraculous or
gan, I'll have these Players
    Play something like the murther of my father
    Before mine uncl
e. I'll observe his looks;
    I'll tent him to the quick. If he but blench,
    I know my course.
 The spirit that I have seen
    May be a devil; and the devil hath power
    T' assume a pleasing
 shape; yea, and perhaps
    Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
    As he is very potent with s
uch spirits,
    Abuses me to damn me. I'll have grounds
    More relative than this. The play's t
he thing
    Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King.         Exit.

ACT 
III. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz,
 Guildenstern,
and Lords.

  King. And can you by no drift of circumstance
    Get from him why 
he puts on this confusion,
    Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
    With turbulent and dan
gerous lunacy?
  Ros. He does confess he feels himself distracted,
    But from what cause he will
 by no means speak.
  Guil. Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
    But with a crafty madnes
s keeps aloof
    When we would bring him on to some confession
    Of his true state.
  Queen. D
id he receive you well?
  Ros. Most like a gentleman.
  Guil. But with much forcing of his disposi
tion.
  Ros. Niggard of question, but of our demands
    Most free in his reply.
  Queen. Did you
 assay him
    To any pastime?
  Ros. Madam, it so fell out that certain players
    We o'erraugh
t on the way. Of these we told him,
    And there did seem in him a kind of joy
    To hear of it.
 They are here about the court,
    And, as I think, they have already order
    This night to pla
y before him.
  Pol. 'Tis most true;
    And he beseech'd me to entreat your Majesties
    To hea
r and see the matter.
  King. With all my heart, and it doth much content me
    To hear him so in
clin'd.
    Good gentlemen, give him a further edge
    And drive his purpose on to these delights
.
  Ros. We shall, my lord.
                            Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
  Ki
ng. Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
    For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
    That he, as 
'twere by accident, may here
    Affront Ophelia.
    Her father and myself (lawful espials)
    
Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing unseen,
    We may of their encounter frankly judge
    And 
gather by him, as he is behav'd,
    If't be th' affliction of his love, or no,
    That thus he s
uffers for.
  Queen. I shall obey you;
    And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
    That your go
od beauties be the happy cause
    Of Hamlet's wildness. So shall I hope your virtues
    Will bri
ng him to his wonted way again,
    To both your honours.
  Oph. Madam, I wish it may.
          
                                         [Exit Queen.]
  Pol. Ophelia, walk you here.- Gracious, so
 please you,
    We will bestow ourselves.- [To Ophelia] Read on this book,
    That show of such 
an exercise may colour
    Your loneliness.- We are oft to blame in this,
    'Tis too much prov'd
, that with devotion's visage
    And pious action we do sugar o'er
    The Devil himself.
  King
. [aside] O, 'tis too true!
    How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
    The harl
ot's cheek, beautied with plast'ring art,
    Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
    Than
 is my deed to my most painted word.
    O heavy burthen!
  Pol. I hear him coming. Let's withdraw
, my lord.
                                      Exeunt King and Polonius].

                    
       Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. To be, or not to be- that is the question:
    Whether 'tis nobler i
n the mind to suffer
    The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
    Or to take arms against a
 sea of troubles,
    And by opposing end them. To die- to sleep-
    No more; and by a sleep to s
ay we end
    The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks
    That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a con
summation
    Devoutly to be wish'd. To die- to sleep.
    To sleep- perchance to dream: ay, there
's the rub!
    For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
    When we have shuffled off this
 mortal coil,
    Must give us pause. There's the respect
    That makes calamity of so long life.

    For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
    Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's c
ontumely,
    The pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay,
    The insolence of office, and the sp
urns
    That patient merit of th' unworthy takes,
    When he himself might his quietus make
   
 With a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear,
    To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
    
But that the dread of something after death-
    The undiscover'd country, from whose bourn
    No
 traveller returns- puzzles the will,
    And makes us rather bear those ills we have
    Than fly
 to others that we know not of?
    Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
    And thus the 
native hue of resolution
    Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
    And enterprises o
f great pith and moment
    With this regard their currents turn awry
    And lose the name of act
ion.- Soft you now!
    The fair Ophelia!- Nymph, in thy orisons
    Be all my sins rememb'red.
 
 Oph. Good my lord,
    How does your honour for this many a day?
  Ham. I humbly thank you; well,
 well, well.
  Oph. My lord, I have remembrances of yours
    That I have longed long to re-delive
r.
    I pray you, now receive them.
  Ham. No, not I!
    I never gave you aught.
  Oph. My hon
our'd lord, you know right well you did,
    And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd
    A
s made the things more rich. Their perfume lost,
    Take these again; for to the noble mind
    R
ich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
    There, my lord.
  Ham. Ha, ha! Are you honest?
 
 Oph. My lord?
  Ham. Are you fair?
  Oph. What means your lordship?
  Ham. That if you be honest
 and fair, your honesty should admit
no
    discourse to your beauty.
  Oph. Could beauty, my lor
d, have better commerce than with
honesty?
  Ham. Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner t
ransform
    honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty
can
    translate beauty
 into his likeness. This was sometime a
paradox,
    but now the time gives it proof. I did love y
ou once.
  Oph. Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
  Ham. You should not have believ'd me; f
or virtue cannot so
    inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it. I loved
you
    not.

  Oph. I was the more deceived.
  Ham. Get thee to a nunnery! Why wouldst thou be a breeder of
   
 sinners? I am myself indifferent honest, but yet I could
accuse
    me of such things that it wer
e better my mother had not borne
me.
    I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more offence
s at
my
    beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give
    them shape, or time
 to act them in. What should such fellows
as I
    do, crawling between earth and heaven? We are a
rrant knaves
all;
    believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where's your
    father?
  O
ph. At home, my lord.
  Ham. Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool
    nowhere
 but in's own house. Farewell.
  Oph. O, help him, you sweet heavens!
  Ham. If thou dost marry, I
'll give thee this plague for thy
dowry:
    be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt
 not
escape
    calumny. Get thee to a nunnery. Go, farewell. Or if thou wilt
    needs marry, ma
rry a fool; for wise men know well enough what
    monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go; and
 quickly too.
    Farewell.
  Oph. O heavenly powers, restore him!
  Ham. I have heard of your pa
intings too, well enough. God hath
    given you one face, and you make yourselves another. You jig
,
you
    amble, and you lisp; you nickname God's creatures and make
your
    wantonness your ig
norance. Go to, I'll no more on't! it hath
made
    me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages.
 Those that are
    married already- all but one- shall live; the rest shall keep
as
    they are
. To a nunnery, go.                            Exit.
  Oph. O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown
!
    The courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword,
    Th' expectancy and rose of the
 fair state,
    The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
    Th' observ'd of all observers- qu
ite, quite down!
    And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
    That suck'd the honey of his m
usic vows,
    Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
    Like sweet bells jangled, out of 
tune and harsh;
    That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
    Blasted with ecstasy. O, wo
e is me
    T' have seen what I have seen, see what I see!

                   Enter King and Pol
onius.

  King. Love? his affections do not that way tend;
    Nor what he spake, though it lack'
d form a little,
    Was not like madness. There's something in his soul
    O'er which his melanc
holy sits on brood;
    And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
    Will be some danger; which f
or to prevent,
    I have in quick determination
    Thus set it down: he shall with speed to Engl
and
    For the demand of our neglected tribute.
    Haply the seas, and countries different,
   
 With variable objects, shall expel
    This something-settled matter in his heart,
    Whereon hi
s brains still beating puts him thus
    From fashion of himself. What think you on't?
  Pol. It s
hall do well. But yet do I believe
    The origin and commencement of his grief
    Sprung from ne
glected love.- How now, Ophelia?
    You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said.
    We heard it a
ll.- My lord, do as you please;
    But if you hold it fit, after the play
    Let his queen mothe
r all alone entreat him
    To show his grief. Let her be round with him;
    And I'll be plac'd s
o please you, in the ear
    Of all their conference. If she find him not,
    To England send him
; or confine him where
    Your wisdom best shall think.
  King. It shall be so.
    Madness in g
reat ones must not unwatch'd go.         Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. hall in the Castle.


Enter Hamlet and three of the Players.

  Ham. Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounc'd it 
to you,
    trippingly on the tongue. But if you mouth it, as many of our
    players do, I had as
 live the town crier spoke my lines. Nor
do
    not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but
 use all
    gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and (as I may say)
    whirlwind of your pa
ssion, you must acquire and beget a
    temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to

the
    soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion
to
    tatters, to very r
ags, to split the cars of the groundlings,
who
    (for the most part) are capable of nothing but 
inexplicable
dumb
    shows and noise. I would have such a fellow whipp'd for
o'erdoing
    Term
agant. It out-herods Herod. Pray you avoid it.
  Player. I warrant your honour.
  Ham. Be not too 
tame neither; but let your own discretion be
your
    tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word
 to the action;
with
    this special observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of
    nature
: for anything so overdone is from the purpose of
playing,
    whose end, both at the first and no
w, was and is, to hold, as
    'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show Virtue her own
feature,
 
   scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time
his
    form and pressure. Now this 
overdone, or come tardy off,
though
    it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious

    grieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance
    o'erweigh a whole theatre of 
others. O, there be players that
I
    have seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly (n
ot
to
    speak it profanely), that, neither having the accent of
    Christians, nor the gait of
 Christian, pagan, nor man, have
so
    strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of Nature's

    journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they
imitated
    humanity so abominably.

  Player. I hope we have reform'd that indifferently with us,
sir.
  Ham. O, reform it altogether!
 And let those that play your
clowns
    speak no more than is set down for them. For there be of 
them
    that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren
    spectators to laugh too
, though in the mean time some
necessary
    question of the play be then to be considered. That's

villanous
    and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it.
Go
    make you ready
.
                                                 Exeunt Players.

            Enter Polonius, R
osencrantz, and Guildenstern.

    How now, my lord? Will the King hear this piece of work?
  Pol
. And the Queen too, and that presently.
  Ham. Bid the players make haste, [Exit Polonius.] Will y
ou two
    help to hasten them?
  Both. We will, my lord.                       Exeunt they two.

  Ham. What, ho, Horatio!

                      Enter Horatio.

  Hor. Here, sweet lord, at you
r service.
  Ham. Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
    As e'er my conversation cop'd withal.

  Hor. O, my dear lord!
  Ham. Nay, do not think I flatter;
    For what advancement may I hope fr
om thee,
    That no revenue hast but thy good spirits
    To feed and clothe thee? Why should the
 poor be flatter'd?
    No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
    And crook the pregnant hi
nges of the knee
    Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
    Since my dear soul was m
istress of her choice
    And could of men distinguish, her election
    Hath seal'd thee for hers
elf. For thou hast been
    As one, in suff'ring all, that suffers nothing;
    A man that Fortune
's buffets and rewards
    Hast ta'en with equal thanks; and blest are those
    Whose blood and j
udgment are so well commingled
    That they are not a pipe for Fortune's finger
    To sound what
 stop she please. Give me that man
    That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
    In my 
heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
    As I do thee. Something too much of this I
    There i
s a play to-night before the King.
    One scene of it comes near the circumstance,
    Which I ha
ve told thee, of my father's death.
    I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
    Even with t
he very comment of thy soul
    Observe my uncle. If his occulted guilt
    Do not itself unkennel
 in one speech,
    It is a damned ghost that we have seen,
    And my imaginations are as foul
 
   As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
    For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,
    And 
after we will both our judgments join
    In censure of his seeming.
  Hor. Well, my lord.
    If
 he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
    And scape detecting, I will pay the theft.


    Sound a flourish. [Enter Trumpets and Kettledrums. Danish
    march. [Enter King, Queen, Poloni
us, Ophelia, Rosencrantz,
      Guildenstern, and other Lords attendant, with the Guard
          
             carrying torches.

  Ham. They are coming to the play. I must be idle.
    Get you a
 place.
  King. How fares our cousin Hamlet?
  Ham. Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish. 
I eat the
air,
    promise-cramm'd. You cannot feed capons so.
  King. I have nothing with this a
nswer, Hamlet. These words are
not
    mine.
  Ham. No, nor mine now. [To Polonius] My lord, you 
play'd once
    i' th' university, you say?
  Pol. That did I, my lord, and was accounted a good a
ctor.
  Ham. What did you enact?
  Pol. I did enact Julius Caesar; I was kill'd i' th' Capitol;
B
rutus
    kill'd me.
  Ham. It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf
there. Be
    t
he players ready.
  Ros. Ay, my lord. They stay upon your patience.
  Queen. Come hither, my dear 
Hamlet, sit by me.
  Ham. No, good mother. Here's metal more attractive.
  Pol. [to the King] O, h
o! do you mark that?
  Ham. Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
                                  [Sits
 down at Ophelia's feet.]

  Oph. No, my lord.
  Ham. I mean, my head upon your lap?
  Oph. Ay, 
my lord.
  Ham. Do you think I meant country matters?
  Oph. I think nothing, my lord.
  Ham. Tha
t's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
  Oph. What is, my lord?
  Ham. Nothing.
  Oph. Yo
u are merry, my lord.
  Ham. Who, I?
  Oph. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. O God, your only jig-maker! What 
should a man do but be
merry?
    For look you how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father
died

    within 's two hours.
  Oph. Nay 'tis twice two months, my lord.
  Ham. So long? Nay then, le
t the devil wear black, for I'll have
a
    suit of sables. O heavens! die two months ago, and not

forgotten
    yet? Then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his
life
    half a year.
 But, by'r Lady, he must build churches then; or
else
    shall he suffer not thinking on, with th
e hobby-horse, whose

    epitaph is 'For O, for O, the hobby-horse is forgot!'

               
Hautboys play. The dumb show enters.

    Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embrac
ing
    him and he her. She kneels, and makes show of protestation
    unto him. He takes her up, 
and declines his head upon her
    neck. He lays him down upon a bank of flowers. She, seeing
    
him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his
    crown, kisses it, pours poison in
 the sleeper's ears, and
    leaves him. The Queen returns, finds the King dead, and makes
    pas
sionate action. The Poisoner with some three or four
Mutes,
    comes in again, seem to condole wi
th her. The dead body is
    carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with gifts; she
    seems 
harsh and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts
    his love.
                                 
                        Exeunt.

  Oph. What means this, my lord?
  Ham. Marry, this is miching m
alhecho; it means mischief.
  Oph. Belike this show imports the argument of the play.

          
            Enter Prologue.

  Ham. We shall know by this fellow. The players cannot keep
counsel
;
    they'll tell all.
  Oph. Will he tell us what this show meant?
  Ham. Ay, or any show that 
you'll show him. Be not you asham'd
to
    show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means.
  Oph
. You are naught, you are naught! I'll mark the play.

    Pro. For us, and for our tragedy,
    
  Here stooping to your clemency,
      We beg your hearing patiently.                     [Exit.]


  Ham. Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
  Oph. 'Tis brief, my lord.
  Ham. As woman's
 love.

              Enter [two Players as] King and Queen.

    King. Full thirty times hath P
hoebus' cart gone round
      Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
      And thirty dozen
 moons with borrowed sheen
      About the world have times twelve thirties been,
      Since love
 our hearts, and Hymen did our hands,
      Unite comutual in most sacred bands.
    Queen. So man
y journeys may the sun and moon
      Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
      But woe is 
me! you are so sick of late,
      So far from cheer and from your former state.
      That I dist
rust you. Yet, though I distrust,
      Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must;
      For women'
s fear and love holds quantity,
      In neither aught, or in extremity.
      Now what my love is
, proof hath made you know;
      And as my love is siz'd, my fear is so.
      Where love is grea
t, the littlest doubts are fear;
      Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.
    
King. Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;
      My operant powers their functions leav
e to do.
      And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
      Honour'd, belov'd, and haply o
ne as kind
      For husband shalt thou-
    Queen. O, confound the rest!
      Such love must ne
eds be treason in my breast.
      When second husband let me be accurst!
      None wed the secon
d but who killed the first.

  Ham. [aside] Wormwood, wormwood!

    Queen. The instances that s
econd marriage move
      Are base respects of thrift, but none of love.
      A second time I kil
l my husband dead
      When second husband kisses me in bed.
    King. I do believe you think wha
t now you speak;
      But what we do determine oft we break.
      Purpose is but the slave to me
mory,
      Of violent birth, but poor validity;
      Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the
 tree,
      But fall unshaken when they mellow be.
      Most necessary 'tis that we forget
    
  To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt.
      What to ourselves in passion we propose,
     
 The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
      The violence of either grief or joy
      Their 
own enactures with themselves destroy.
      Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
      
Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
      This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange

      That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
      For 'tis a question left us yet 
to prove,
      Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
      The great man down, you mar
k his favourite flies,
      The poor advanc'd makes friends of enemies;
      And hitherto doth l
ove on fortune tend,
      For who not needs shall never lack a friend,
      And who in want a ho
llow friend doth try,
      Directly seasons him his enemy.
      But, orderly to end where I begu
n,
      Our wills and fates do so contrary run
      That our devices still are overthrown;
    
  Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own.
      So think thou wilt no second husband wed
;
      But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
    Queen. Nor earth to me give food, no
r heaven light,
      Sport and repose lock from me day and night,
      To desperation turn my tr
ust and hope,
      An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope,
      Each opposite that blanks the f
ace of joy
      Meet what I would have well, and it destroy,
      Both here and hence pursue me 
lasting strife,
      If, once a widow, ever I be wife!

  Ham. If she should break it now!

  
  King. 'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile.
      My spirits grow dull, and fain I woul
d beguile
      The tedious day with sleep.
    Queen. Sleep rock thy brain,
                    
                                [He] sleeps.
      And never come mischance between us twain!
Exit
.

  Ham. Madam, how like you this play?
  Queen. The lady doth protest too much, methinks.
  Ha
m. O, but she'll keep her word.
  King. Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in't?
  H
am. No, no! They do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i'
th'
    world.
  King. What do you ca
ll the play?
  Ham. 'The Mousetrap.' Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the
    image of a murth
er done in Vienna. Gonzago is the duke's
name;
    his wife, Baptista. You shall see anon. 'Tis a 
knavish piece
of
    work; but what o' that? Your Majesty, and we that have free
    souls, it to
uches us not. Let the gall'd jade winch; our
withers
    are unwrung.

                         
Enter Lucianus.

    This is one Lucianus, nephew to the King.
  Oph. You are as good as a chorus
, my lord.
  Ham. I could interpret between you and your love, if I could
see
    the puppets dal
lying.
  Oph. You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
  Ham. It would cost you a groaning to take off
 my edge.
  Oph. Still better, and worse.
  Ham. So you must take your husbands.- Begin, murtherer
. Pox,
leave
    thy damnable faces, and begin! Come, the croaking raven doth
    bellow for reve
nge.

    Luc. Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
      Confederate season,
 else no creature seeing;
      Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,
      With Hecate'
s ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,
      Thy natural magic and dire property
      On wholesom
e life usurp immediately.
                                   Pours the poison in his ears.

  Ham
. He poisons him i' th' garden for's estate. His name's
Gonzago.
    The story is extant, and writ
ten in very choice Italian. You
    shall see anon how the murtherer gets the love of Gonzago's
wi
fe.
  Oph. The King rises.
  Ham. What, frighted with false fire?
  Queen. How fares my lord?
  
Pol. Give o'er the play.
  King. Give me some light! Away!
  All. Lights, lights, lights!
       
                       Exeunt all but Hamlet and Horatio.
  Ham.   Why, let the strucken deer go we
ep,
          The hart ungalled play;
         For some must watch, while some must sleep:
      
    Thus runs the world away.
    Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers- if the rest of
my

    fortunes turn Turk with me-with two Provincial roses on my
raz'd
    shoes, get me a fellows
hip in a cry of players, sir?
  Hor. Half a share.
  Ham.   A whole one I!
         For thou dost
 know, O Damon dear,
           This realm dismantled was
         Of Jove himself; and now reigns
 here
           A very, very- pajock.
  Hor. You might have rhym'd.
  Ham. O good Horatio, I'll 
take the ghost's word for a thousand
    pound! Didst perceive?
  Hor. Very well, my lord.
  Ham.
 Upon the talk of the poisoning?
  Hor. I did very well note him.
  Ham.   Aha! Come, some music! 
Come, the recorders!
         For if the King like not the comedy,
         Why then, belike he li
kes it not, perdy.
    Come, some music!

                Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.


  Guil. Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.
  Ham. Sir, a whole history.
  Guil. The King,
 sir-
  Ham. Ay, sir, what of him?
  Guil. Is in his retirement, marvellous distemper'd.
  Ham. W
ith drink, sir?
  Guil. No, my lord; rather with choler.
  Ham. Your wisdom should show itself mor
e richer to signify this
to
    the doctor; for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps
    
plunge him into far more choler.
  Guil. Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame, and
sta
rt
    not so wildly from my affair.
  Ham. I am tame, sir; pronounce.
  Guil. The Queen, your mo
ther, in most great affliction of
spirit
    hath sent me to you.
  Ham. You are welcome.
  Guil
. Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right
breed.
    If it shall please you to make m
e a wholesome answer, I will
do
    your mother's commandment; if not, your pardon and my return

    shall be the end of my business.
  Ham. Sir, I cannot.
  Guil. What, my lord?
  Ham. Make you
 a wholesome answer; my wit's diseas'd. But, sir,
such
    answer as I can make, you shall command
; or rather, as you
say,
    my mother. Therefore no more, but to the matter! My mother,
you
   
 say-
  Ros. Then thus she says: your behaviour hath struck her into
    amazement and admiration.

  Ham. O wonderful son, that can so stonish a mother! But is
there no
    sequel at the heels of
 this mother's admiration? Impart.
  Ros. She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to

bed.
  Ham. We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any
    further trade with us
?
  Ros. My lord, you once did love me.
  Ham. And do still, by these pickers and stealers!
  Ros
. Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? You do
surely
    bar the door upon your own libe
rty, if you deny your griefs
to
    your friend.
  Ham. Sir, I lack advancement.
  Ros. How can 
that be, when you have the voice of the King
himself
    for your succession in Denmark?
  Ham. A
y, sir, but 'while the grass grows'- the proverb is
something
    musty.

                     E
nter the Players with recorders.

    O, the recorders! Let me see one. To withdraw with you- why

do
    you go about to recover the wind of me, as if you would drive
me
    into a toil?
  Guil
. O my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too
unmannerly.
  Ham. I do not well understand th
at. Will you play upon this
pipe?
  Guil. My lord, I cannot.
  Ham. I pray you.
  Guil. Believe 
me, I cannot.
  Ham. I do beseech you.
  Guil. I know, no touch of it, my lord.
  Ham. It is as e
asy as lying. Govern these ventages with your
    fingers and thumbs, give it breath with your mout
h, and it
will
    discourse most eloquent music. Look you, these are the stops.
  Guil. But thes
e cannot I command to any utt'rance of harmony. I
    have not the skill.
  Ham. Why, look you now
, how unworthy a thing you make of me!
You
    would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops
; you
would
    pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound me from my
    lowest note to 
the top of my compass; and there is much
music,
    excellent voice, in this little organ, yet can
not you make it
    speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am easier to be play'd on than
a
    pipe? Cal
l me what instrument you will, though you can fret
me,
    you cannot play upon me.

           
             Enter Polonius.

    God bless you, sir!
  Pol. My lord, the Queen would speak with 
you, and presently.
  Ham. Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
  Pol. By th
' mass, and 'tis like a camel indeed.
  Ham. Methinks it is like a weasel.
  Pol. It is back'd lik
e a weasel.
  Ham. Or like a whale.
  Pol. Very like a whale.
  Ham. Then will I come to my mothe
r by-and-by.- They fool me to
the
    top of my bent.- I will come by-and-by.
  Pol. I will say s
o.                                      Exit.
  Ham. 'By-and-by' is easily said.- Leave me, friends
.
                                        [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]

    'Tis now the very witchin
g time of night,
    When churchyards yawn, and hell itself breathes out
    Contagion to this wor
ld. Now could I drink hot blood
    And do such bitter business as the day
    Would quake to look
 on. Soft! now to my mother!
    O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever
    The soul of Nero e
nter this firm bosom.
    Let me be cruel, not unnatural;
    I will speak daggers to her, but use
 none.
    My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites-
    How in my words somever she be shent,
  
  To give them seals never, my soul, consent!             Exit.




Scene III.
A room in the C
astle.

Enter King, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.

  King. I like him not, nor stands it safe w
ith us
    To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;
    I your commission will forthwith d
ispatch,
    And he to England shall along with you.
    The terms of our estate may not endure
 
   Hazard so near us as doth hourly grow
    Out of his lunacies.
  Guil. We will ourselves provid
e.
    Most holy and religious fear it is
    To keep those many many bodies safe
    That live a
nd feed upon your Majesty.
  Ros. The single and peculiar life is bound
    With all the strength 
and armour of the mind
    To keep itself from noyance; but much more
    That spirit upon whose w
eal depends and rests
    The lives of many. The cesse of majesty
    Dies not alone, but like a g
ulf doth draw
    What's near it with it. It is a massy wheel,
    Fix'd on the summit of the high
est mount,
    To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
    Are mortis'd and adjoin'd; whic
h when it falls,
    Each small annexment, petty consequence,
    Attends the boist'rous ruin. Nev
er alone
    Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.
  King. Arm you, I pray you, to this spe
edy voyage;
    For we will fetters put upon this fear,
    Which now goes too free-footed.
  Bot
h. We will haste us.
                                               Exeunt Gentlemen.

          
         Enter Polonius.

  Pol. My lord, he's going to his mother's closet.
    Behind the arras
 I'll convey myself
    To hear the process. I'll warrant she'll tax him home;
    And, as you sai
d, and wisely was it said,
    'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,
    Since nature m
akes them partial, should o'erhear
    The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege.
    I'll c
all upon you ere you go to bed
    And tell you what I know.
  King. Thanks, dear my lord.
      
                                          Exit [Polonius].
    O, my offence is rank, it smells to 
heaven;
    It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,
    A brother's murther! Pray can I not,
    
Though inclination be as sharp as will.
    My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent,
    And, l
ike a man to double business bound,
    I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
    And both n
eglect. What if this cursed hand
    Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,
    Is there n
ot rain enough in the sweet heavens
    To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
    But to 
confront the visage of offence?
    And what's in prayer but this twofold force,
    To be foresta
lled ere we come to fall,
    Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;
    My fault is past. But
, O, what form of prayer
    Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murther'?
    That cannot be; 
since I am still possess'd
    Of those effects for which I did the murther-
    My crown, mine ow
n ambition, and my queen.
    May one be pardon'd and retain th' offence?
    In the corrupted cur
rents of this world
    Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,
    And oft 'tis seen the wick
ed prize itself
    Buys out the law; but 'tis not so above.
    There is no shuffling; there the 
action lies
    In his true nature, and we ourselves compell'd,
    Even to the teeth and forehead
 of our faults,
    To give in evidence. What then? What rests?
    Try what repentance can. What 
can it not?
    Yet what can it when one cannot repent?
    O wretched state! O bosom black as dea
th!
    O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
    Art more engag'd! Help, angels! Make assay.

    Bow, stubborn knees; and heart with strings of steel,
    Be soft as sinews of the new-born b
abe!
    All may be well.                                  He kneels.

                         E
nter Hamlet.

  Ham. Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
    And now I'll do't. And so he g
oes to heaven,
    And so am I reveng'd. That would be scann'd.
    A villain kills my father; and
 for that,
    I, his sole son, do this same villain send
    To heaven.
    Why, this is hire an
d salary, not revenge!
    He took my father grossly, full of bread,
    With all his crimes broad
 blown, as flush as May;
    And how his audit stands, who knows save heaven?
    But in our circu
mstance and course of thought,
    'Tis heavy with him; and am I then reveng'd,
    To take him in
 the purging of his soul,
    When he is fit and seasoned for his passage?
    No.
    Up, sword,
 and know thou a more horrid hent.
    When he is drunk asleep; or in his rage;
    Or in th' ince
stuous pleasure of his bed;
    At gaming, swearing, or about some act
    That has no relish of s
alvation in't-
    Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,
    And that his soul may be 
as damn'd and black
    As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays.
    This physic but prolongs th

Scene IV.
The Queen's closet.


Enter Queen and Polonius.

  Pol. He will come straight. Look you lay home to him.
    Tell hi
m his pranks have been too broad to bear with,
    And that your Grace hath screen'd and stood betw
een
    Much heat and him. I'll silence me even here.
    Pray you be round with him.
  Ham. (wit
hin) Mother, mother, mother!
  Queen. I'll warrant you; fear me not. Withdraw; I hear him
coming.

                              [Polonius hides behind the arras.]

                          Enter
 Hamlet.

  Ham. Now, mother, what's the matter?
  Queen. Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offen
ded.
  Ham. Mother, you have my father much offended.
  Queen. Come, come, you answer with an idle
 tongue.
  Ham. Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
  Queen. Why, how now, Hamlet?
  Ham. 
What's the matter now?
  Queen. Have you forgot me?
  Ham. No, by the rood, not so!
    You are t
he Queen, your husband's brother's wife,
    And (would it were not so!) you are my mother.
  Quee
n. Nay, then I'll set those to you that can speak.
  Ham. Come, come, and sit you down. You shall n
ot budge;
    You go not till I set you up a glass
    Where you may see the inmost part of you.

  Queen. What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murther me?
    Help, help, ho!
  Pol. [behind] What, ho
! help, help, help!
  Ham. [draws] How now? a rat? Dead for a ducat, dead!
            [Makes a pa
ss through the arras and] kills Polonius.
  Pol. [behind] O, I am slain!
  Queen. O me, what hast 
thou done?
  Ham. Nay, I know not. Is it the King?
  Queen. O, what a rash and bloody deed is this
!
  Ham. A bloody deed- almost as bad, good mother,
    As kill a king, and marry with his brother
.
  Queen. As kill a king?
  Ham. Ay, lady, it was my word.
                         [Lifts up th
e arras and sees Polonius.]
    Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
    I took thee for
 thy better. Take thy fortune.
    Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.
    Leave wringing 
of your hands. Peace! sit you down
    And let me wring your heart; for so I shall
    If it be ma
de of penetrable stuff;
    If damned custom have not braz'd it so
    That it is proof and bulwar
k against sense.
  Queen. What have I done that thou dar'st wag thy tongue
    In noise so rude ag
ainst me?
  Ham. Such an act
    That blurs the grace and blush of modesty;
    Calls virtue hypo
crite; takes off the rose
    From the fair forehead of an innocent love,
    And sets a blister t
here; makes marriage vows
    As false as dicers' oaths. O, such a deed
    As from the body of co
ntraction plucks
    The very soul, and sweet religion makes
    A rhapsody of words! Heaven's fac
e doth glow;
    Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
    With tristful visage, as against the do
om,
    Is thought-sick at the act.
  Queen. Ah me, what act,
    That roars so loud and thunders
 in the index?
  Ham. Look here upon th's picture, and on this,
    The counterfeit presentment of
 two brothers.
    See what a grace was seated on this brow;
    Hyperion's curls; the front of Jo
ve himself;
    An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
    A station like the herald Mercury

    New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill:
    A combination and a form indeed
    Where every god 
did seem to set his seal
    To give the world assurance of a man.
    This was your husband. Look
 you now what follows.
    Here is your husband, like a mildew'd ear
    Blasting his wholesome br
other. Have you eyes?
    Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
    And batten on this mo
or? Ha! have you eyes
    You cannot call it love; for at your age
    The heyday in the blood is 
tame, it's humble,
    And waits upon the judgment; and what judgment
    Would step from this to 
this? Sense sure you have,
    Else could you not have motion; but sure that sense
    Is apoplex'
d; for madness would not err,
    Nor sense to ecstacy was ne'er so thrall'd
    But it reserv'd s
ome quantity of choice
    To serve in such a difference. What devil was't
    That thus hath coze
n'd you at hoodman-blind?
    Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
    Ears without hands 
or eyes, smelling sans all,
    Or but a sickly part of one true sense
    Could not so mope.
   
 O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
    If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
    T
o flaming youth let virtue be as wax
    And melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame
    When the 
compulsive ardour gives the charge,
    Since frost itself as actively doth burn,
    And reason p
anders will.
  Queen. O Hamlet, speak no more!
    Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul,
    
And there I see such black and grained spots
    As will not leave their tinct.
  Ham. Nay, but to
 live
    In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
    Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love

    Over the nasty sty!
  Queen. O, speak to me no more!
    These words like daggers enter in m
ine ears.
    No more, sweet Hamlet!
  Ham. A murtherer and a villain!
    A slave that is not tw
entieth part the tithe
    Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
    A cutpurse of the empire a
nd the rule,
    That from a shelf the precious diadem stole
    And put it in his pocket!
  Quee
n. No more!

                Enter the Ghost in his nightgown.

  Ham. A king of shreds and patc
hes!-
    Save me and hover o'er me with your wings,
    You heavenly guards! What would your grac
ious figure?
  Queen. Alas, he's mad!
  Ham. Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
    That, l
aps'd in time and passion, lets go by
    Th' important acting of your dread command?
    O, say!

  Ghost. Do not forget. This visitation
    Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
    But lo
ok, amazement on thy mother sits.
    O, step between her and her fighting soul
    Conceit in wea
kest bodies strongest works.
    Speak to her, Hamlet.
  Ham. How is it with you, lady?
  Queen. 
Alas, how is't with you,
    That you do bend your eye on vacancy,
    And with th' encorporal air
 do hold discourse?
    Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
    And, as the sleeping sold
iers in th' alarm,
    Your bedded hairs, like life in excrements,
    Start up and stand an end. 
O gentle son,
    Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
    Sprinkle cool patience! Whereon do 
you look?
  Ham. On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!
    His form and cause conjoin'd, pr
eaching to stones,
    Would make them capable.- Do not look upon me,
    Lest with this piteous a
ction you convert
    My stern effects. Then what I have to do
    Will want true colour- tears pe
rchance for blood.
  Queen. To whom do you speak this?
  Ham. Do you see nothing there?
  Queen. 
Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
  Ham. Nor did you nothing hear?
  Queen. No, nothing but o
urselves.
  Ham. Why, look you there! Look how it steals away!
    My father, in his habit as he l
iv'd!
    Look where he goes even now out at the portal!
                                         
            Exit Ghost.
  Queen. This is the very coinage of your brain.
    This bodiless creatio
n ecstasy
    Is very cunning in.
  Ham. Ecstasy?
    My pulse as yours doth temperately keep tim
e
    And makes as healthful music. It is not madness
    That I have utt'red. Bring me to the tes
t,
    And I the matter will reword; which madness
    Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grac
e,
    Lay not that flattering unction to your soul
    That not your trespass but my madness spea
ks.
    It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
    Whiles rank corruption, mining all withi
n,
    Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
    Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;

    And do not spread the compost on the weeds
    To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;

    For in the fatness of these pursy times
    Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg-
    Yea, 
curb and woo for leave to do him good.
  Queen. O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
  Ham
. O, throw away the worser part of it,
    And live the purer with the other half,
    Good night-
 but go not to my uncle's bed.
    Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
    That monster, custom, 
who all sense doth eat
    Of habits evil, is angel yet in this,
    That to the use of actions fa
ir and good
    He likewise gives a frock or livery,
    That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,

    And that shall lend a kind of easiness
    To the next abstinence; the next more easy;
    For
 use almost can change the stamp of nature,
    And either [master] the devil, or throw him out
  
  With wondrous potency. Once more, good night;
    And when you are desirous to be blest,
    I'l
l blessing beg of you.- For this same lord,
    I do repent; but heaven hath pleas'd it so,
    To
 punish me with this, and this with me,
    That I must be their scourge and minister.
    I will 
bestow him, and will answer well
    The death I gave him. So again, good night.
    I must be cru
el, only to be kind;
    Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.
    One word more, good lady.

  Queen. What shall I do?
  Ham. Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
    Let the bloat King
 tempt you again to bed;
    Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
    And let him, for 
a pair of reechy kisses,
    Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,
    Make you to rav
el all this matter out,
    That I essentially am not in madness,
    But mad in craft. 'Twere goo
d you let him know;
    For who that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
    Would from a paddock, f
rom a bat, a gib
    Such dear concernings hide? Who would do so?
    No, in despite of sense and 
secrecy,
    Unpeg the basket on the house's top,
    Let the birds fly, and like the famous ape,

    To try conclusions, in the basket creep
    And break your own neck down.
  Queen. Be thou as
sur'd, if words be made of breath,
    And breath of life, I have no life to breathe
    What thou
 hast said to me.
  Ham. I must to England; you know that?
  Queen. Alack,
    I had forgot! 'Tis
 so concluded on.
  Ham. There's letters seal'd; and my two schoolfellows,
    Whom I will trust a
s I will adders fang'd,
    They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way
    And marshal me to kn
avery. Let it work;
    For 'tis the sport to have the enginer
    Hoist with his own petar; and '
t shall go hard
    But I will delve one yard below their mines
    And blow them at the moon. O, 
'tis most sweet
    When in one line two crafts directly meet.
    This man shall set me packing.

    I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.-
    Mother, good night.- Indeed, this counsellor

    Is now most still, most secret, and most grave,
    Who was in life a foolish peating knave.
 
   Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.
    Good night, mother.
                  [Exit the 
Queen. Then] Exit Hamlet, tugging in
                                                       Poloniu

ACT IV. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King and Queen, w
ith Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  King. There's matter in these sighs. These profound heaves
 
   You must translate; 'tis fit we understand them.
    Where is your son?
  Queen. Bestow this pl
ace on us a little while.
                          [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
    Ah,
 mine own lord, what have I seen to-night!
  King. What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
  Queen. Mad a
s the sea and wind when both contend
    Which is the mightier. In his lawless fit
    Behind the 
arras hearing something stir,
    Whips out his rapier, cries 'A rat, a rat!'
    And in this brai
nish apprehension kills
    The unseen good old man.
  King. O heavy deed!
    It had been so wit
h us, had we been there.
    His liberty is full of threats to all-
    To you yourself, to us, to
 every one.
    Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
    It will be laid to us, whose pro
vidence
    Should have kept short, restrain'd, and out of haunt
    This mad young man. But so mu
ch was our love
    We would not understand what was most fit,
    But, like the owner of a foul d
isease,
    To keep it from divulging, let it feed
    Even on the pith of life. Where is he gone?

  Queen. To draw apart the body he hath kill'd;
    O'er whom his very madness, like some ore
  
  Among a mineral of metals base,
    Shows itself pure. He weeps for what is done.
  King. O Gert
rude, come away!
    The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch
    But we will ship him hence; a
nd this vile deed
    We must with all our majesty and skill
    Both countenance and excuse. Ho, 
Guildenstern!

             Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

    Friends both, go join you w
ith some further aid.
    Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
    And from his mother's closet 
hath he dragg'd him.
    Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body
    Into the chapel. I pr
ay you haste in this.
                          Exeunt [Rosencrantz and Guildenstern].
    Come, G
ertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends
    And let them know both what we mean to do
    And wh
at's untimely done. [So haply slander-]
    Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter,
    As level 
as the cannon to his blank,
    Transports his poisoned shot- may miss our name
    And hit the wo
undless air.- O, come away!
    My soul is full of discord and dismay.
                           
                              Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A passage in the Castle.

Ente
r Hamlet.

  Ham. Safely stow'd.
  Gentlemen. (within) Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!
  Ham. But soft! Wha
t noise? Who calls on Hamlet? O, here they
come.

               Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenste
rn.

  Ros. What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
  Ham. Compounded it with dust, wher
eto 'tis kin.
  Ros. Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
    And bear it to the chapel.

  Ham. Do not believe it.
  Ros. Believe what?
  Ham. That I can keep your counsel, and not mine
 own. Besides,
to be
    demanded of a sponge, what replication should be made by the
son
    of
 a king?
  Ros. Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
  Ham. Ay, sir; that soaks up the King's counte
nance, his
rewards,
    his authorities. But such officers do the King best service
in
    the e
nd. He keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his
jaw;
    first mouth'd, to be last swallowed.
 When he needs what you
have
    glean'd, it is but squeezing you and, sponge, you shall be
dry

    again.
  Ros. I understand you not, my lord.
  Ham. I am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps i
n a foolish ear.
  Ros. My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us
to
    the Kin
g.
  Ham. The body is with the King, but the King is not with the
body.
    The King is a thing-

  Guil. A thing, my lord?
  Ham. Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.
          
                                               Exeunt.




Scene III.
Elsinore. A room in the 
Castle.

Enter King.

  King. I have sent to seek him and to find the body.
    How dangerous i
s it that this man goes loose!
    Yet must not we put the strong law on him.
    He's lov'd of th
e distracted multitude,
    Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;
    And where 'tis so,
 th' offender's scourge is weigh'd,
    But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,
    Th
is sudden sending him away must seem
    Deliberate pause. Diseases desperate grown
    By despera
te appliance are reliev'd,
    Or not at all.

                    Enter Rosencrantz.

    How 
now O What hath befall'n?
  Ros. Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
    We cannot get from 
him.
  King. But where is he?
  Ros. Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
  King. Br
ing him before us.
  Ros. Ho, Guildenstern! Bring in my lord.

        Enter Hamlet and Guildenst
ern [with Attendants].

  King. Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
  Ham. At supper.
  King. At supp
er? Where?
  Ham. Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A certain
    convocation of politic w
orms are e'en at him. Your worm is
your
    only emperor for diet. We fat all creatures else to fa
t us,
and
    we fat ourselves for maggots. Your fat king and your lean
beggar
    is but variab
le service- two dishes, but to one table. That's
the
    end.
  King. Alas, alas!
  Ham. A man m
ay fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and
eat
    of the fish that hath fed of that worm.

  King. What dost thou mean by this?
  Ham. Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress

through
    the guts of a beggar.
  King. Where is Polonius?
  Ham. In heaven. Send thither to s
ee. If your messenger find him
not
    there, seek him i' th' other place yourself. But indeed, if

you
    find him not within this month, you shall nose him as you go
up
    the stair, into the
 lobby.
  King. Go seek him there. [To Attendants.]
  Ham. He will stay till you come.
          
                                  [Exeunt Attendants.]
  King. Hamlet, this deed, for thine especia
l safety,-
    Which we do tender as we dearly grieve
    For that which thou hast done,- must sen
d thee hence
    With fiery quickness. Therefore prepare thyself.
    The bark is ready and the wi
nd at help,
    Th' associates tend, and everything is bent
    For England.
  Ham. For England?

  King. Ay, Hamlet.
  Ham. Good.
  King. So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
  Ham. I see a 
cherub that sees them. But come, for England!
    Farewell, dear mother.
  King. Thy loving father
, Hamlet.
  Ham. My mother! Father and mother is man and wife; man and wife
is
    one flesh; and
 so, my mother. Come, for England!
Exit.
  King. Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard.

    Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night.
    Away! for everything is seal'd and done
    T
hat else leans on th' affair. Pray you make haste.
                            Exeunt Rosencrantz a
nd Guildenstern]
    And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught,-
    As my great power thereo
f may give thee sense,
    Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
    After the Danish sword, a
nd thy free awe
    Pays homage to us,- thou mayst not coldly set
    Our sovereign process, which
 imports at full,
    By letters congruing to that effect,
    The present death of Hamlet. Do it,
 England;
    For like the hectic in my blood he rages,
    And thou must cure me. Till I know 'ti
s done,
    Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.             Exit.

Scene
 IV.
Near Elsinore.

Enter Fortinbras with his Army over the stage.

  For. Go, Captain, from m
e greet the Danish king.
    Tell him that by his license Fortinbras
    Craves the conveyance of 
a promis'd march
    Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.
    If that his Majesty would augh
t with us,
    We shall express our duty in his eye;
    And let him know so.
  Capt. I will do't
, my lord.
  For. Go softly on.
                                   Exeunt [all but the Captain].


       Enter Hamlet, Rosencrantz, [Guildenstern,] and others.

  Ham. Good sir, whose powers are
 these?
  Capt. They are of Norway, sir.
  Ham. How purpos'd, sir, I pray you?
  Capt. Against so
me part of Poland.
  Ham. Who commands them, sir?
  Capt. The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.
 
 Ham. Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
    Or for some frontier?
  Capt. Truly to speak, a
nd with no addition,
    We go to gain a little patch of ground
    That hath in it no profit but 
the name.
    To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
    Nor will it yield to Norway or th
e Pole
    A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
  Ham. Why, then the Polack never will defend 
it.
  Capt. Yes, it is already garrison'd.
  Ham. Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
 
   Will not debate the question of this straw.
    This is th' imposthume of much wealth and peace,

    That inward breaks, and shows no cause without
    Why the man dies.- I humbly thank you, sir
.
  Capt. God b' wi' you, sir.                             [Exit.]
  Ros. Will't please you go, my
 lord?
  Ham. I'll be with you straight. Go a little before.
                                     
   [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]
    How all occasions do inform against me
    And spur my dull reveng
e! What is a man,
    If his chief good and market of his time
    Be but to sleep and feed? A bea
st, no more.
    Sure he that made us with such large discourse,
    Looking before and after, gav
e us not
    That capability and godlike reason
    To fust in us unus'd. Now, whether it be
    
Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple
    Of thinking too precisely on th' event,-
    A though
t which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
    And ever three parts coward,- I do not know
    W
hy yet I live to say 'This thing's to do,'
    Sith I have cause, and will, and strength, and means

    To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me.
    Witness this army of such mass and charge,
 
   Led by a delicate and tender prince,
    Whose spirit, with divine ambition puff'd,
    Makes m
ouths at the invisible event,
    Exposing what is mortal and unsure
    To all that fortune, deat
h, and danger dare,
    Even for an eggshell. Rightly to be great
    Is not to stir without great
 argument,
    But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
    When honour's at the stake. How stand I 
then,
    That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,
    Excitements of my reason and my blood,

    And let all sleep, while to my shame I see
    The imminent death of twenty thousand men
    
That for a fantasy and trick of fame
    Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot
    Whereo
n the numbers cannot try the cause,
    Which is not tomb enough and continent
    To hide the sla
in? O, from this time forth,
    My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!            Exit.

Scene V.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter Horatio, Queen, and a Gentleman.


  Queen. I will not speak with her.
  Gent. She is importunate, indeed distract.
    Her mood w
ill needs be pitied.
  Queen. What would she have?
  Gent. She speaks much of her father; says she
 hears
    There's tricks i' th' world, and hems, and beats her heart;
    Spurns enviously at str
aws; speaks things in doubt,
    That carry but half sense. Her speech is nothing,
    Yet the uns
haped use of it doth move
    The hearers to collection; they aim at it,
    And botch the words u
p fit to their own thoughts;
    Which, as her winks and nods and gestures yield them,
    Indeed 
would make one think there might be thought,
    Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
  Hor. '
Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew
    Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.

  Queen. Let her come in.
                                               [Exit Gentleman.]
    [
Aside] To my sick soul (as sin's true nature is)
    Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.

    So full of artless jealousy is guilt
    It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.

          
       Enter Ophelia distracted.

  Oph. Where is the beauteous Majesty of Denmark?
  Queen. How 
now, Ophelia?
  Oph. (sings)
         How should I your true-love know
           From another on
e?
         By his cockle bat and' staff
           And his sandal shoon.

  Queen. Alas, sweet 
lady, what imports this song?
  Oph. Say you? Nay, pray You mark.

    (Sings) He is dead and gon
e, lady,
              He is dead and gone;
            At his head a grass-green turf,
         
     At his heels a stone.

    O, ho!
  Queen. Nay, but Ophelia-
  Oph. Pray you mark.

    (
Sings) White his shroud as the mountain snow-

                    Enter King.

  Queen. Alas, l
ook here, my lord!
  Oph. (Sings)
           Larded all with sweet flowers;
         Which bewept
 to the grave did not go
           With true-love showers.

  King. How do you, pretty lady?
  
Oph. Well, God dild you! They say the owl was a baker's
daughter.
    Lord, we know what we are, b
ut know not what we may be. God
be at
    your table!
  King. Conceit upon her father.
  Oph. Pr
ay let's have no words of this; but when they ask, you
what
    it means, say you this:

    (Si
ngs) To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,
              All in the morning bedtime,
            And
 I a maid at your window,
              To be your Valentine.

            Then up he rose and do
nn'd his clo'es
              And dupp'd the chamber door,
            Let in the maid, that out a
 maid
              Never departed more.

  King. Pretty Ophelia!
  Oph. Indeed, la, without an 
oath, I'll make an end on't!

    [Sings] By Gis and by Saint Charity,
              Alack, and f
ie for shame!
            Young men will do't if they come to't
              By Cock, they are to
 blame.

            Quoth she, 'Before you tumbled me,
              You promis'd me to wed.'


    He answers:

            'So would I 'a' done, by yonder sun,
              An thou hadst no
t come to my bed.'

  King. How long hath she been thus?
  Oph. I hope all will be well. We must 
be patient; but I cannot
    choose but weep to think they would lay him i' th' cold
ground.
    
My brother shall know of it; and so I thank you for your good
    counsel. Come, my coach! Good nig
ht, ladies. Good night,
sweet
    ladies. Good night, good night.                         Exit
  
King. Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.
                                          
       [Exit Horatio.]

    O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs
    All from her fath
er's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
    When sorrows come, they come not single spies.
    But in ba
ttalions! First, her father slain;
    Next, your son gone, and he most violent author
    Of his 
own just remove; the people muddied,
    Thick and and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers

    For good Polonius' death, and we have done but greenly
    In hugger-mugger to inter him; poor 
Ophelia
    Divided from herself and her fair judgment,
    Without the which we are pictures or m
ere beasts;
    Last, and as much containing as all these,
    Her brother is in secret come from 
France;
    And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
    Feeds on his wonder, keep, himself in clou
ds,
    With pestilent speeches of his father's death,
    Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,

    Will nothing stick our person to arraign
    In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
    Li
ke to a murd'ring piece, in many places
    Give me superfluous death.                  A noise wit
hin.
  Queen. Alack, what noise is this?
  King. Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.


                     Enter a Messenger.

    What is the matter?
  Mess. Save Yourself, my lord
:
    The ocean, overpeering of his list,
    Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
    Th
an Young Laertes, in a riotous head,
    O'erbears Your offices. The rabble call him lord;
    And
, as the world were now but to begin,
    Antiquity forgot, custom not known,
    The ratifiers an
d props of every word,
    They cry 'Choose we! Laertes shall be king!'
    Caps, hands, and tongu
es applaud it to the clouds,
    'Laertes shall be king! Laertes king!'
                          
                       A noise within.
  Queen. How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!
    O,
 this is counter, you false Danish dogs!
  King. The doors are broke.

                    Enter 
Laertes with others.

  Laer. Where is this king?- Sirs, staid you all without.
  All. No, let's 
come in!
  Laer. I pray you give me leave.
  All. We will, we will!
  Laer. I thank you. Keep the
 door.      [Exeunt his Followers.]
    O thou vile king,
    Give me my father!
  Queen. Calmly,
 good Laertes.
  Laer. That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard;
    Cries cuckold to m
y father; brands the harlot
    Even here between the chaste unsmirched brows
    Of my true mothe
r.
  King. What is the cause, Laertes,
    That thy rebellion looks so giantlike?
    Let him go,
 Gertrude. Do not fear our person.
    There's such divinity doth hedge a king
    That treason ca
n but peep to what it would,
    Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,
    Why thou art thus 
incens'd. Let him go, Gertrude.
    Speak, man.
  Laer. Where is my father?
  King. Dead.
  Quee
n. But not by him!
  King. Let him demand his fill.
  Laer. How came he dead? I'll not be juggled 
with:
    To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil
    Conscience and grace, to the profou
ndest pit!
    I dare damnation. To this point I stand,
    That both the world, I give to neglige
nce,
    Let come what comes; only I'll be reveng'd
    Most throughly for my father.
  King. Who
 shall stay you?
  Laer. My will, not all the world!
    And for my means, I'll husband them so we
ll
    They shall go far with little.
  King. Good Laertes,
    If you desire to know the certain
ty
    Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge
    That sweepstake you will draw bo
th friend and foe,
    Winner and loser?
  Laer. None but his enemies.
  King. Will you know them
 then?
  Laer. To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms
    And, like the kind life-rend'rin
g pelican,
    Repast them with my blood.
  King. Why, now You speak
    Like a good child and a 
true gentleman.
    That I am guiltless of your father's death,
    And am most sensibly in grief 
for it,
    It shall as level to your judgment pierce
    As day does to your eye.
              
                A noise within: 'Let her come in.'
  Laer. How now? What noise is that?

        
              Enter Ophelia.

    O heat, dry up my brains! Tears seven times salt
    Burn out t
he sense and virtue of mine eye!
    By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight
    Till our s
cale turn the beam. O rose of May!
    Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
    O heavens! is't 
possible a young maid's wits
    Should be as mortal as an old man's life?
    Nature is fine in l
ove, and where 'tis fine,
    It sends some precious instance of itself
    After the thing it lov
es.

  Oph. (sings)
         They bore him barefac'd on the bier
           (Hey non nony, nony,
 hey nony)
         And in his grave rain'd many a tear.

    Fare you well, my dove!
  Laer. Ha
dst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
    It could not move thus.
  Oph. You must sing 'A
-down a-down, and you call him a-down-a.'
O,
    how the wheel becomes it! It is the false steward
, that stole
his
    master's daughter.
  Laer. This nothing's more than matter.
  Oph. There's 
rosemary, that's for remembrance. Pray you, love,
    remember. And there is pansies, that's for th
oughts.
  Laer. A document in madness! Thoughts and remembrance fitted.
  Oph. There's fennel for 
you, and columbines. There's rue for
you,
    and here's some for me. We may call it herb of grace
 o'
Sundays.
    O, you must wear your rue with a difference! There's a daisy.
I
    would give 
you some violets, but they wither'd all when my
father
    died. They say he made a good end.

 
   [Sings] For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.

  Laer. Thought and affliction, passion, hell its
elf,
    She turns to favour and to prettiness.
  Oph. (sings)
         And will he not come agai
n?
         And will he not come again?
           No, no, he is dead;
           Go to thy death
bed;
         He never will come again.

         His beard was as white as snow,
         All f
laxen was his poll.
           He is gone, he is gone,
           And we cast away moan.
        
 God 'a'mercy on his soul!

    And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God b' wi' you.
Exit.
  
Laer. Do you see this, O God?
  King. Laertes, I must commune with your grief,
    Or you deny me 
right. Go but apart,
    Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will,
    And they shall hear
 and judge 'twixt you and me.
    If by direct or by collateral hand
    They find us touch'd, we 
will our kingdom give,
    Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours,
    To you in satisfact
ion; but if not,
    Be you content to lend your patience to us,
    And we shall jointly labour w
ith your soul
    To give it due content.
  Laer. Let this be so.
    His means of death, his obs
cure funeral-
    No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,
    No noble rite nor formal ost
entation,-
    Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
    That I must call't in question
.
  King. So you shall;
    And where th' offence is let the great axe fall.
    I pray you go wi
th me.
                                                          Exeunt

Scene 
VI.
Elsinore. Another room in the Castle.

Enter Horatio with an Attendant.

  Hor. What are th
ey that would speak with me?
  Servant. Seafaring men, sir. They say they have letters for
you.
 
 Hor. Let them come in.
                                               [Exit Attendant.]
    I do 
not know from what part of the world
    I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.

         
                 Enter Sailors.

  Sailor. God bless you, sir.
  Hor. Let him bless thee too.
  
Sailor. 'A shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter for
you,
    sir,- it comes from th' amba
ssador that was bound for
England- if
    your name be Horatio, as I am let to know it is.
  Hor.
 (reads the letter) 'Horatio, when thou shalt have
overlook'd
    this, give these fellows some me
ans to the King. They have
    letters for him. Ere we were two days old at sea, a pirate of

   
 very warlike appointment gave us chase. Finding ourselves too
    slow of sail, we put on a compel
led valour, and in the
grapple I
    boarded them. On the instant they got clear of our ship; so I

    alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with me like
thieves
    of mercy; but they kne
w what they did: I am to do a good turn
for
    them. Let the King have the letters I have sent, a

thou
    to me with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death. I have
words
    to speak

                            'He that th

Scene VII.
Elsinore. Another room in the Castle.

Enter King and Laertes.


  King. Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
    And You must put me in your heart for fr
iend,
    Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
    That he which hath your noble father sl
ain
    Pursued my life.
  Laer. It well appears. But tell me
    Why you proceeded not against t
hese feats
    So crimeful and so capital in nature,
    As by your safety, wisdom, all things els
e,
    You mainly were stirr'd up.
  King. O, for two special reasons,
    Which may to you, perh
aps, seem much unsinew'd,
    But yet to me they are strong. The Queen his mother
    Lives almost
 by his looks; and for myself,-
    My virtue or my plague, be it either which,-
    She's so conj
unctive to my life and soul
    That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
    I could not but
 by her. The other motive
    Why to a public count I might not go
    Is the great love the gener
al gender bear him,
    Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
    Would, like the spring
 that turneth wood to stone,
    Convert his gives to graces; so that my arrows,
    Too slightly 
timber'd for so loud a wind,
    Would have reverted to my bow again,
    And not where I had aim'
d them.
  Laer. And so have I a noble father lost;
    A sister driven into desp'rate terms,
    
Whose worth, if praises may go back again,
    Stood challenger on mount of all the age
    For he
r perfections. But my revenge will come.
  King. Break not your sleeps for that. You must not think

    That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
    That we can let our beard be shook with danger
,
    And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more.
    I lov'd your father, and we love ours
elf,
    And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine-

                 Enter a Messenger with le
tters.

    How now? What news?
  Mess. Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:
    This to your Majesty;
 this to the Queen.
  King. From Hamlet? Who brought them?
  Mess. Sailors, my lord, they say; I s
aw them not.
    They were given me by Claudio; he receiv'd them
    Of him that brought them.
  
King. Laertes, you shall hear them.
    Leave us.
                                                
 Exit Messenger.
    [Reads]'High and Mighty,-You shall know I am set naked on
your
    kingdom. 
To-morrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes;
    when I shall (first asking your pardon the
reunto) recount the
    occasion of my sudden and more strange return.
                           
                          'HAMLET.'
    What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?
    Or 
is it some abuse, and no such thing?
  Laer. Know you the hand?
  King. 'Tis Hamlet's character. '
Naked!'
    And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'
    Can you advise me?
  Laer. I am lost i
n it, my lord. But let him come!
    It warms the very sickness in my heart
    That I shall live 
and tell him to his teeth,
    'Thus didest thou.'
  King. If it be so, Laertes
    (As how shoul
d it be so? how otherwise?),
    Will you be rul'd by me?
  Laer. Ay my lord,
    So you will not
 o'errule me to a peace.
  King. To thine own peace. If he be now return'd
    As checking at his 
voyage, and that he means
    No more to undertake it, I will work him
    To exploit now ripe in 
my device,
    Under the which he shall not choose but fall;
    And for his death no wind shall b
reathe
    But even his mother shall uncharge the practice
    And call it accident.
  Laer. My l
ord, I will be rul'd;
    The rather, if you could devise it so
    That I might be the organ.
  
King. It falls right.
    You have been talk'd of since your travel much,
    And that in Hamlet's
 hearing, for a quality
    Wherein they say you shine, Your sum of parts
    Did not together plu
ck such envy from him
    As did that one; and that, in my regard,
    Of the unworthiest siege.

  Laer. What part is that, my lord?
  King. A very riband in the cap of youth-
    Yet needfull to
o; for youth no less becomes
    The light and careless livery that it wears
    Than settled age 
his sables and his weeds,
    Importing health and graveness. Two months since
    Here was a gent
leman of Normandy.
    I have seen myself, and serv'd against, the French,
    And they can well o
n horseback; but this gallant
    Had witchcraft in't. He grew unto his seat,
    And to such wond
rous doing brought his horse
    As had he been incorps'd and demi-natur'd
    With the brave beas
t. So far he topp'd my thought
    That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
    Come short of what
 he did.
  Laer. A Norman was't?
  King. A Norman.
  Laer. Upon my life, Lamound.
  King. The ve
ry same.
  Laer. I know him well. He is the broach indeed
    And gem of all the nation.
  King. 
He made confession of you;
    And gave you such a masterly report
    For art and exercise in you
r defence,
    And for your rapier most especially,
    That he cried out 'twould be a sight indee
d
    If one could match you. The scrimers of their nation
    He swore had neither motion, guard,
 nor eye,
    If you oppos'd them. Sir, this report of his
    Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy

    That he could nothing do but wish and beg
    Your sudden coming o'er to play with you.
    
Now, out of this-
  Laer. What out of this, my lord?
  King. Laertes, was your father dear to you?

    Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
    A face without a heart,'
  Laer. Why ask you t
his?
  King. Not that I think you did not love your father;
    But that I know love is begun by t
ime,
    And that I see, in passages of proof,
    Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
    T
here lives within the very flame of love
    A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
    And n
othing is at a like goodness still;
    For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
    Dies in his own to
o-much. That we would do,
    We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes,
    And hath a
batements and delays as many
    As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
    And then this
 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
    That hurts by easing. But to the quick o' th' ulcer!
   
 Hamlet comes back. What would you undertake
    To show yourself your father's son in deed
    Mo
re than in words?
  Laer. To cut his throat i' th' church!
  King. No place indeed should murther 
sanctuarize;
    Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,
    Will you do this? Keep clos
e within your chamber.
    Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home.
    We'll put on those sh
all praise your excellence
    And set a double varnish on the fame
    The Frenchman gave you; br
ing you in fine together
    And wager on your heads. He, being remiss,
    Most generous, and fre
e from all contriving,
    Will not peruse the foils; so that with ease,
    Or with a little shuf
fling, you may choose
    A sword unbated, and, in a pass of practice,
    Requite him for your fa
ther.
  Laer. I will do't!
    And for that purpose I'll anoint my sword.
    I bought an unction
 of a mountebank,
    So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
    Where it draws blood no cataplasm
 so rare,
    Collected from all simples that have virtue
    Under the moon, can save the thing f
rom death
    This is but scratch'd withal. I'll touch my point
    With this contagion, that, if 
I gall him slightly,
    It may be death.
  King. Let's further think of this,
    Weigh what con
venience both of time and means
    May fit us to our shape. If this should fall,
    And that our
 drift look through our bad performance.
    'Twere better not assay'd. Therefore this project
   
 Should have a back or second, that might hold
    If this did blast in proof. Soft! let me see.
 
   We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings-
    I ha't!
    When in your motion you are hot and
 dry-
    As make your bouts more violent to that end-
    And that he calls for drink, I'll have 
prepar'd him
    A chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,
    If he by chance escape your ven
om'd stuck,
    Our purpose may hold there.- But stay, what noise,

                           En
ter Queen.

    How now, sweet queen?
  Queen. One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
    So fa
st they follow. Your sister's drown'd, Laertes.
  Laer. Drown'd! O, where?
  Queen. There is a wil
low grows aslant a brook,
    That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream.
    There with fant
astic garlands did she come
    Of crowflowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,
    That liber
al shepherds give a grosser name,
    But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them.
    Ther
e on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds
    Clamb'ring to hang, an envious sliver broke,
    Whe
n down her weedy trophies and herself
    Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide
    A
nd, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up;
    Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes,
    
As one incapable of her own distress,
    Or like a creature native and indued
    Unto that eleme
nt; but long it could not be
    Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
    Pull'd the po
or wretch from her melodious lay
    To muddy death.
  Laer. Alas, then she is drown'd?
  Queen. 
Drown'd, drown'd.
  Laer. Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
    And therefore I forbid my
 tears; but yet
    It is our trick; nature her custom holds,
    Let shame say what it will. When
 these are gone,
    The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord.
    I have a speech of fire, that fain
 would blaze
    But that this folly douts it.                          Exit.
  King. Let's follow
, Gertrude.
    How much I had to do to calm his rage I
    Now fear I this will give it start aga
in;
    Therefore let's follow.
                                                         Exeunt.

ACT V. Scene I.
Elsinore. A churchyard.

Enter two Clowns, [with spades and p
ickaxes].

  Clown. Is she to be buried in Christian burial when she
wilfully
    seeks her own 
salvation?
  Other. I tell thee she is; therefore make her grave straight.
    The crowner hath sa
te on her, and finds it Christian burial.
  Clown. How can that be, unless she drown'd herself in h
er own
    defence?
  Other. Why, 'tis found so.
  Clown. It must be se offendendo; it cannot be 
else. For here
lies
    the point: if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act; and
an
    act
 hath three branches-it is to act, to do, and to perform;
    argal, she drown'd herself wittingly.

  Other. Nay, but hear you, Goodman Delver!
  Clown. Give me leave. Here lies the water; good. He
re stands
the
    man; good. If the man go to this water and drown himself, it
is,
    will he n
ill he, he goes- mark you that. But if the water
come to
    him and drown him, he drowns not hims
elf. Argal, he that is
not
    guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.
  Other. But is
 this law?
  Clown. Ay, marry, is't- crowner's quest law.
  Other. Will you ha' the truth an't? If
 this had not been a
    gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o' Christian
burial.
  Clow
n. Why, there thou say'st! And the more pity that great
folk
    should have count'nance in this w
orld to drown or hang
themselves
    more than their even-Christian. Come, my spade! There is no

    ancient gentlemen but gard'ners, ditchers, and grave-makers.
They
    hold up Adam's professio
n.
  Other. Was he a gentleman?
  Clown. 'A was the first that ever bore arms.
  Other. Why, he h
ad none.
  Clown. What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the
Scripture?
    The Scripture 
says Adam digg'd. Could he dig without arms?
I'll
    put another question to thee. If thou answer
est me not to the
    purpose, confess thyself-
  Other. Go to!
  Clown. What is he that builds s
tronger than either the mason,
the
    shipwright, or the carpenter?
  Other. The gallows-maker; 
for that frame outlives a thousand
    tenants.
  Clown. I like thy wit well, in good faith. The g
allows does
well.
    But how does it well? It does well to those that do ill. Now,
    thou dost
 ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the
    church. Argal, the gallows may do well to th
ee. To't again,
come!
  Other. Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a
    carpenter
?
  Clown. Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
  Other. Marry, now I can tell!
  Clown. To't.
  Other.
 Mass, I cannot tell.

                 Enter Hamlet and Horatio afar off.

  Clown. Cudgel thy 
brains no more about it, for your dull ass
will
    not mend his pace with beating; and when you a
re ask'd this
    question next, say 'a grave-maker.' The houses he makes lasts
    till doomsday.
 Go, get thee to Yaughan; fetch me a stoup of
    liquor.
                                        
    [Exit Second Clown.]


                       [Clown digs and] sings.

       In youth when
 I did love, did love,
         Methought it was very sweet;
       To contract- O- the time for- 
a- my behove,
         O, methought there- a- was nothing- a- meet.

  Ham. Has this fellow no fe
eling of his business, that he sings
at
    grave-making?
  Hor. Custom hath made it in him a pro
perty of easiness.
  Ham. 'Tis e'en so. The hand of little employment hath the
daintier
    sense
.
  Clown. (sings)
         But age with his stealing steps
           Hath clawed me in his clut
ch,
         And hath shipped me intil the land,
           As if I had never been such.
        
                                    [Throws up a skull.]

  Ham. That skull had a tongue in it, an
d could sing once. How
the
    knave jowls it to the ground,as if 'twere Cain's jawbone,
that
  
  did the first murther! This might be the pate of a
Politician,
    which this ass now o'erreache
s; one that would circumvent
God,
    might it not?
  Hor. It might, my lord.
  Ham. Or of a cou
rtier, which could say 'Good morrow, sweet
lord!
    How dost thou, good lord?' This might be my L
ord Such-a-one,
that
    prais'd my Lord Such-a-one's horse when he meant to beg it-
might
    i
t not?
  Hor. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Why, e'en so! and now my Lady Worm's, chapless, and
knock'd
  
  about the mazzard with a sexton's spade. Here's fine
revolution,
    and we had the trick to see
't. Did these bones cost no more
the
    breeding but to play at loggets with 'em? Mine ache to th
ink
    on't.
  Clown. (Sings)
         A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,
           For and a shr
ouding sheet;
         O, a Pit of clay for to be made
           For such a guest is meet.
     
                                 Throws up [another skull].

  Ham. There's another. Why may not t
hat be the skull of a
lawyer?
    Where be his quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, his
tenures
,
    and his tricks? Why does he suffer this rude knave now to
knock
    him about the sconce wi
th a dirty shovel, and will not tell
him
    of his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be i
n's time
a
    great buyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizances,
his
    fines, his dou
ble vouchers, his recoveries. Is this the fine
of
    his fines, and the recovery of his recoverie
s, to have his
fine
    pate full of fine dirt? Will his vouchers vouch him no more
of
    his p
urchases, and double ones too, than the length and
breadth
    of a pair of indentures? The very c
onveyances of his lands
will
    scarcely lie in this box; and must th' inheritor himself have
no

    more, ha?
  Hor. Not a jot more, my lord.
  Ham. Is not parchment made of sheepskins?
  Hor
. Ay, my lord, And of calveskins too.
  Ham. They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in

that. I
    will speak to this fellow. Whose grave's this, sirrah?
  Clown. Mine, sir.

    [Si
ngs] O, a pit of clay for to be made
              For such a guest is meet.

  Ham. I think it b
e thine indeed, for thou liest in't.
  Clown. You lie out on't, sir, and therefore 'tis not yours.

    For my part, I do not lie in't, yet it is mine.
  Ham. Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say 
it is thine. 'Tis
for
    the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.
  Clown. 'Tis a quic
k lie, sir; 'twill away again from me to you.
  Ham. What man dost thou dig it for?
  Clown. For n
o man, sir.
  Ham. What woman then?
  Clown. For none neither.
  Ham. Who is to be buried in't?

  Clown. One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's
dead.
  Ham. How absolute the knave 
is! We must speak by the card, or
    equivocation will undo us. By the Lord, Horatio, this three

years
    I have taken note of it, the age is grown so picked that the
toe
    of the peasant com
es so near the heel of the courtier he
galls
    his kibe.- How long hast thou been a grave-maker?

  Clown. Of all the days i' th' year, I came to't that day that
our
    last king Hamlet overcam
e Fortinbras.
  Ham. How long is that since?
  Clown. Cannot you tell that? Every fool can tell th
at. It was
the
    very day that young Hamlet was born- he that is mad, and sent
    into England
.
  Ham. Ay, marry, why was be sent into England?
  Clown. Why, because 'a was mad. 'A shall recov
er his wits
there;
    or, if 'a do not, 'tis no great matter there.
  Ham. Why?
  Clown. 'Twill
 not he seen in him there. There the men are as
mad as
    he.
  Ham. How came he mad?
  Clown. 
Very strangely, they say.
  Ham. How strangely?
  Clown. Faith, e'en with losing his wits.
  Ham.
 Upon what ground?
  Clown. Why, here in Denmark. I have been sexton here, man and
boy
    thirty
 years.
  Ham. How long will a man lie i' th' earth ere he rot?
  Clown. Faith, if 'a be not rotte
n before 'a die (as we have
many
    pocky corses now-a-days that will scarce hold the laying in,

I
    will last you some eight year or nine year. A tanner will
last
    you nine year.
  Ham. 
Why he more than another?
  Clown. Why, sir, his hide is so tann'd with his trade that 'a
will
  
  keep out water a great while; and your water is a sore
decayer of
    your whoreson dead body. H
ere's a skull now. This skull hath
lien
    you i' th' earth three-and-twenty years.
  Ham. Whose
 was it?
  Clown. A whoreson, mad fellow's it was. Whose do you think it
was?
  Ham. Nay, I know 
not.
  Clown. A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! 'A pour'd a flagon
of
    Rhenish on my head o
nce. This same skull, sir, was Yorick's
    skull, the King's jester.
  Ham. This?
  Clown. E'en 
that.
  Ham. Let me see. [Takes the skull.] Alas, poor Yorick! I knew
him,
    Horatio. A fellow 
of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy.
He
    hath borne me on his back a thousand times. And 
now how
abhorred
    in my imagination it is! My gorge rises at it. Here hung
those
    lips tha
t I have kiss'd I know not how oft. Where be your
gibes
    now? your gambols? your songs? your fl
ashes of merriment that
    were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock
your
    o
wn grinning? Quite chap- fall'n? Now get you to my lady's
    chamber, and tell her, let her paint 
an inch thick, to this
    favour she must come. Make her laugh at that. Prithee,
Horatio,
    te
ll me one thing.
  Hor. What's that, my lord?
  Ham. Dost thou think Alexander look'd o' this fash
ion i' th'
earth?
  Hor. E'en so.
  Ham. And smelt so? Pah!
                                    
      [Puts down the skull.]
  Hor. E'en so, my lord.
  Ham. To what base uses we may return, Hora
tio! Why may not
    imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it
    stopping a 
bunghole?
  Hor. 'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.
  Ham. No, faith, not a jot; bu
t to follow him thither with
modesty
    enough, and likelihood to lead it; as thus: Alexander die
d,
    Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust
is
    earth; of earth we ma
ke loam; and why of that loam (whereto
he
    was converted) might they not stop a beer barrel?
 
   Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
    Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.
    O, 
that that earth which kept the world in awe
    Should patch a wall t' expel the winter's flaw!
  
  But soft! but soft! aside! Here comes the King-

    Enter [priests with] a coffin [in funeral p
rocession], King,
             Queen, Laertes, with Lords attendant.]

    The Queen, the courtie
rs. Who is this they follow?
    And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken
    The corse they 
follow did with desp'rate hand
    Fordo it own life. 'Twas of some estate.
    Couch we awhile, a
nd mark.
                                         [Retires with Horatio.]

  Laer. What ceremony 
else?
  Ham. That is Laertes,
    A very noble youth. Mark.
  Laer. What ceremony else?
  Priest
. Her obsequies have been as far enlarg'd
    As we have warranty. Her death was doubtful;
    And
, but that great command o'ersways the order,
    She should in ground unsanctified have lodg'd
  
  Till the last trumpet. For charitable prayers,
    Shards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown o
n her.
    Yet here she is allow'd her virgin rites,
    Her maiden strewments, and the bringing h
ome
    Of bell and burial.
  Laer. Must there no more be done?
  Priest. No more be done.
    W
e should profane the service of the dead
    To sing a requiem and such rest to her
    As to peac
e-parted souls.
  Laer. Lay her i' th' earth;
    And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
    May 
violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,
    A minist'ring angel shall my sister be
    When 
thou liest howling.
  Ham. What, the fair Ophelia?
  Queen. Sweets to the sweet! Farewell.
      
                                       [Scatters flowers.]
    I hop'd thou shouldst have been my H
amlet's wife;
    I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
    And not have strew'd thy
 grave.
  Laer. O, treble woe
    Fall ten times treble on that cursed head
    Whose wicked deed
 thy most ingenious sense
    Depriv'd thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,
    Till I have caught 
her once more in mine arms.
                                             Leaps in the grave.
    N
ow pile your dust upon the quick and dead
    Till of this flat a mountain you have made
    T' o'
ertop old Pelion or the skyish head
    Of blue Olympus.
  Ham. [comes forward] What is he whose g
rief
    Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow
    Conjures the wand'ring stars, and make
s them stand
    Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,
    Hamlet the Dane.                    [
Leaps in after Laertes.
  Laer. The devil take thy soul!
                                         
   [Grapples with him].
  Ham. Thou pray'st not well.
    I prithee take thy fingers from my throa
t;
    For, though I am not splenitive and rash,
    Yet have I in me something dangerous,
    Wh
ich let thy wisdom fear. Hold off thy hand!
  King. Pluck them asunder.
  Queen. Hamlet, Hamlet!

  All. Gentlemen!
  Hor. Good my lord, be quiet.
             [The Attendants part them, and they 
come out of the
                                                         grave.]
  Ham. Why, I wil
l fight with him upon this theme
    Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
  Queen. O my son, what 
theme?
  Ham. I lov'd Ophelia. Forty thousand brothers
    Could not (with all their quantity of l
ove)
    Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?
  King. O, he is mad, Laertes.
  Queen. For l
ove of God, forbear him!
  Ham. 'Swounds, show me what thou't do.
    Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo
't fast? woo't tear thyself?
    Woo't drink up esill? eat a crocodile?
    I'll do't. Dost thou c
ome here to whine?
    To outface me with leaping in her grave?
    Be buried quick with her, and 
so will I.
    And if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
    Millions of acres on us, till ou
r ground,
    Singeing his pate against the burning zone,
    Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'
lt mouth,
    I'll rant as well as thou.
  Queen. This is mere madness;
    And thus a while the 
fit will work on him.
    Anon, as patient as the female dove
    When that her golden couplets ar
e disclos'd,
    His silence will sit drooping.
  Ham. Hear you, sir!
    What is the reason that
 you use me thus?
    I lov'd you ever. But it is no matter.
    Let Hercules himself do what he m
ay,
    The cat will mew, and dog will have his day.
Exit.
  King. I pray thee, good Horatio, wai
t upon him.
                                                   Exit Horatio.
    [To Laertes] Stre
ngthen your patience in our last night's
speech.
    We'll put the matter to the present push.-
 
   Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.-
    This grave shall have a living monument.
    
An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
    Till then in patience our proceeding be.
              
                                           Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A hall in the Castl
e.

Enter Hamlet and Horatio.

  Ham. So much for this, sir; now shall you see the other.
    Y
ou do remember all the circumstance?
  Hor. Remember it, my lord!
  Ham. Sir, in my heart there wa
s a kind of fighting
    That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay
    Worse than the mutinies 
in the bilboes. Rashly-
    And prais'd be rashness for it; let us know,
    Our indiscretion some
time serves us well
    When our deep plots do pall; and that should learn us
    There's a divini
ty that shapes our ends,
    Rough-hew them how we will-
  Hor. That is most certain.
  Ham. Up f
rom my cabin,
    My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
    Grop'd I to find out them; had my 
desire,
    Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew
    To mine own room again; making so bold

    (My fears forgetting manners) to unseal
    Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio
 
   (O royal knavery!), an exact command,
    Larded with many several sorts of reasons,
    Import
ing Denmark's health, and England's too,
    With, hoo! such bugs and goblins in my life-
    That
, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
    No, not to stay the finding of the axe,
    My head shou
ld be struck off.
  Hor. Is't possible?
  Ham. Here's the commission; read it at more leisure.
  
  But wilt thou bear me how I did proceed?
  Hor. I beseech you.
  Ham. Being thus benetted round 
with villanies,
    Or I could make a prologue to my brains,
    They had begun the play. I sat me
 down;
    Devis'd a new commission; wrote it fair.
    I once did hold it, as our statists do,
 
   A baseness to write fair, and labour'd much
    How to forget that learning; but, sir, now
    
It did me yeoman's service. Wilt thou know
    Th' effect of what I wrote?
  Hor. Ay, good my lord
.
  Ham. An earnest conjuration from the King,
    As England was his faithful tributary,
    As 
love between them like the palm might flourish,
    As peace should still her wheaten garland wear

    And stand a comma 'tween their amities,
    And many such-like as's of great charge,
    That
, on the view and knowing of these contents,
    Without debatement further, more or less,
    He 
should the bearers put to sudden death,
    Not shriving time allow'd.
  Hor. How was this seal'd?

  Ham. Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
    I had my father's signet in my purse,
    Whic
h was the model of that Danish seal;
    Folded the writ up in the form of th' other,
    Subscrib
'd it, gave't th' impression, plac'd it safely,
    The changeling never known. Now, the next day

    Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent
    Thou know'st already.
  Hor. So Guildenste
rn and Rosencrantz go to't.
  Ham. Why, man, they did make love to this employment!
    They are n
ot near my conscience; their defeat
    Does by their own insinuation grow.
    'Tis dangerous whe
n the baser nature comes
    Between the pass and fell incensed points
    Of mighty opposites.
 
 Hor. Why, what a king is this!
  Ham. Does it not, thinks't thee, stand me now upon-
    He that 
hath kill'd my king, and whor'd my mother;
    Popp'd in between th' election and my hopes;
    Th
rown out his angle for my proper life,
    And with such coz'nage- is't not perfect conscience
   
 To quit him with this arm? And is't not to be damn'd
    To let this canker of our nature come
  
  In further evil?
  Hor. It must be shortly known to him from England
    What is the issue of th
e business there.
  Ham. It will be short; the interim is mine,
    And a man's life is no more th
an to say 'one.'
    But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
    That to Laertes I forgot myself,
    
For by the image of my cause I see
    The portraiture of his. I'll court his favours.
    But sur
e the bravery of his grief did put me
    Into a tow'ring passion.
  Hor. Peace! Who comes here?


                 Enter young Osric, a courtier.

  Osr. Your lordship is right welcome back to D
enmark.
  Ham. I humbly thank you, sir. [Aside to Horatio] Dost know this
    waterfly?
  Hor. [a
side to Hamlet] No, my good lord.
  Ham. [aside to Horatio] Thy state is the more gracious; for
't
is a
    vice to know him. He hath much land, and fertile. Let a beast
be
    lord of beasts, and
 his crib shall stand at the king's mess.
'Tis
    a chough; but, as I say, spacious in the posses
sion of dirt.

  Osr. Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should
impart
    a thing 
to you from his Majesty.
  Ham. I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit. Put
your
  
  bonnet to his right use. 'Tis for the head.
  Osr. I thank your lordship, it is very hot.
  Ham.
 No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly.
  Osr. It is indifferent cold, my lord, ind
eed.
  Ham. But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my
complexion.
  Osr. Exceedingly, my 
lord; it is very sultry, as 'twere- I
cannot
    tell how. But, my lord, his Majesty bade me signi
fy to you
that
    he has laid a great wager on your head. Sir, this is the
matter-
  Ham. I bes
eech you remember.
                           [Hamlet moves him to put on his hat.]
  Osr. Nay, go
od my lord; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here
is
    newly come to court Laertes; believe me
, an absolute
gentleman,
    full of most excellent differences, of very soft society and
    gre
at showing. Indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the
card
    or calendar of gentry; for you s
hall find in him the
continent of
    what part a gentleman would see.
  Ham. Sir, his definement
 suffers no perdition in you; though, I

    know, to divide him inventorially would dozy th' arit
hmetic
of
    memory, and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail.
    But, in the verit
y of extolment, I take him to be a soul of
great
    article, and his infusion of such dearth and 
rareness as, to
make
    true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror, and who
else
    woul
d trace him, his umbrage, nothing more.
  Osr. Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
  Ham.
 The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our
more
    rawer breath?
  Osr. Sir?
  
Hor [aside to Hamlet] Is't not possible to understand in
another
    tongue? You will do't, sir, r
eally.
  Ham. What imports the nomination of this gentleman?
  Osr. Of Laertes?
  Hor. [aside] Hi
s purse is empty already. All's golden words are
    spent.
  Ham. Of him, sir.
  Osr. I know you
 are not ignorant-
  Ham. I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would
not
    much 
approve me. Well, sir?
  Osr. You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is-
  Ham. I dare no
t confess that, lest I should compare with him in
    excellence; but to know a man well were to kn
ow himself.
  Osr. I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on
him
    by them, in
 his meed he's unfellowed.
  Ham. What's his weapon?
  Osr. Rapier and dagger.
  Ham. That's two 
of his weapons- but well.
  Osr. The King, sir, hath wager'd with him six Barbary horses;
    agai
nst the which he has impon'd, as I take it, six French
    rapiers and poniards, with their assigns
, as girdle, hangers,
and
    so. Three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy,
    v
ery responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of
    very liberal conceit.
  Ham. What
 call you the carriages?
  Hor. [aside to Hamlet] I knew you must be edified by the
margent
    e
re you had done.
  Osr. The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
  Ham. The phrase would be more germa
ne to the matter if we could
    carry cannon by our sides. I would it might be hangers till
then.

    But on! Six Barbary horses against six French swords, their
    assigns, and three liberal-co
nceited carriages: that's the
French
    bet against the Danish. Why is this all impon'd, as you c
all
it?
  Osr. The King, sir, hath laid that, in a dozen passes between
    yourself and him, he 
shall not exceed you three hits; he hath
    laid on twelve for nine, and it would come to immediat
e trial
    if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.
  Ham. How if I answer no?
  Osr. I mean
, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
  Ham. Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it 
please his
Majesty,
    it is the breathing time of day with me. Let the foils be
    brought, th
e gentleman willing, and the King hold his
purpose,
    I will win for him if I can; if not, I wil
l gain nothing but
my
    shame and the odd hits.
  Osr. Shall I redeliver you e'en so?
  Ham. T
o this effect, sir, after what flourish your nature will.
  Osr. I commend my duty to your lordship
.
  Ham. Yours, yours. [Exit Osric.] He does well to commend it
    himself; there are no tongues 
else for's turn.
  Hor. This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.
  Ham. He did comply wi
th his dug before he suck'd it. Thus has
he,
    and many more of the same bevy that I know the dr
ossy age
dotes
    on, only got the tune of the time and outward habit of
encounter-
    a kind 
of yesty collection, which carries them through and
    through the most fann'd and winnowed opinio
ns; and do but
blow
    them to their trial-the bubbles are out,

                            En
ter a Lord.

  Lord. My lord, his Majesty commended him to you by young Osric,
who
    brings ba
ck to him, that you attend him in the hall. He sends
to
    know if your pleasure hold to play wit
h Laertes, or that you
will
    take longer time.
  Ham. I am constant to my purposes; they follo
w the King's
pleasure.
    If his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or whensoever,
provided
   
 I be so able as now.
  Lord. The King and Queen and all are coming down.
  Ham. In happy time.
 
 Lord. The Queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to
    Laertes before you fall to pla
y.
  Ham. She well instructs me.
                                                    [Exit Lord.]

  Hor. You will lose this wager, my lord.
  Ham. I do not think so. Since he went into France I ha
ve been
in
    continual practice. I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst
not
    think how i
ll all's here about my heart. But it is no matter.
  Hor. Nay, good my lord -
  Ham. It is but foo
lery; but it is such a kind of gaingiving as
    would perhaps trouble a woman.
  Hor. If your min
d dislike anything, obey it. I will forestall
their
    repair hither and say you are not fit.
  
Ham. Not a whit, we defy augury; there's a special providence
in
    the fall of a sparrow. If it 
be now, 'tis not to come; if it
be
    not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will

come:
    the readiness is all. Since no man knows aught of what he
leaves,
    what is't to lea
ve betimes? Let be.

    Enter King, Queen, Laertes, Osric, and Lords, with other
              A
ttendants with foils and gauntlets.
               A table and flagons of wine on it.

  King. Co
me, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
                    [The King puts Laertes' hand into
 Hamlet's.]
  Ham. Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong;
    But pardon't, as you are a
 gentleman.
    This presence knows,
    And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd
    Wit
h sore distraction. What I have done
    That might your nature, honour, and exception
    Roughly
 awake, I here proclaim was madness.
    Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet.
    If Hamlet
 from himself be taken away,
    And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
    Then Hamlet doe
s it not, Hamlet denies it.
    Who does it, then? His madness. If't be so,
    Hamlet is of the f
action that is wrong'd;
    His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
    Sir, in this audience,
    Le
t my disclaiming from a purpos'd evil
    Free me so far in your most generous thoughts
    That I
 have shot my arrow o'er the house
    And hurt my brother.
  Laer. I am satisfied in nature,
   
 Whose motive in this case should stir me most
    To my revenge. But in my terms of honour
    I 
stand aloof, and will no reconcilement
    Till by some elder masters of known honour
    I have a
 voice and precedent of peace
    To keep my name ungor'd. But till that time
    I do receive you
r offer'd love like love,
    And will not wrong it.
  Ham. I embrace it freely,
    And will thi
s brother's wager frankly play.
    Give us the foils. Come on.
  Laer. Come, one for me.
  Ham. 
I'll be your foil, Laertes. In mine ignorance
    Your skill shall, like a star i' th' darkest nigh
t,
    Stick fiery off indeed.
  Laer. You mock me, sir.
  Ham. No, by this hand.
  King. Give t
hem the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
    You know the wager?
  Ham. Very well, my lord.
   
 Your Grace has laid the odds o' th' weaker side.
  King. I do not fear it, I have seen you both;

    But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.
  Laer. This is too heavy; let me see another
.
  Ham. This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
                                      
          Prepare to play.
  Osr. Ay, my good lord.
  King. Set me the stoups of wine upon that ta
ble.
    If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
    Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
   
 Let all the battlements their ordnance fire;
    The King shall drink to Hamlet's better breath,

    And in the cup an union shall he throw
    Richer than that which four successive kings
    In
 Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;
    And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
    The
 trumpet to the cannoneer without,
    The cannons to the heavens, the heaven to earth,
    'Now t
he King drinks to Hamlet.' Come, begin.
    And you the judges, bear a wary eye.
  Ham. Come on, s
ir.
  Laer. Come, my lord.                                They play.
  Ham. One.
  Laer. No.
  H
am. Judgment!
  Osr. A hit, a very palpable hit.
  Laer. Well, again!
  King. Stay, give me drink
. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
    Here's to thy health.
               [Drum; trumpets sound; a p
iece goes off [within].
    Give him the cup.
  Ham. I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile.

    Come. (They play.) Another hit. What say you?
  Laer. A touch, a touch; I do confess't.
  Kin
g. Our son shall win.
  Queen. He's fat, and scant of breath.
    Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, ru
b thy brows.
    The Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
  Ham. Good madam!
  King. Gertrude, 
do not drink.
  Queen. I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.          Drinks.
  King. [aside] It 
is the poison'd cup; it is too late.
  Ham. I dare not drink yet, madam; by-and-by.
  Queen. Come,
 let me wipe thy face.
  Laer. My lord, I'll hit him now.
  King. I do not think't.
  Laer. [asid
e] And yet it is almost against my conscience.
  Ham. Come for the third, Laertes! You but dally.

    Pray you pass with your best violence;
    I am afeard you make a wanton of me.
  Laer. Say yo
u so? Come on.                               Play.
  Osr. Nothing neither way.
  Laer. Have at you
 now!
                [Laertes wounds Hamlet; then] in scuffling, they
                    change 
rapiers, [and Hamlet wounds Laertes].
  King. Part them! They are incens'd.
  Ham. Nay come! again
!                         The Queen falls.

  Osr. Look to the Queen there, ho!
  Hor. They bleed
 on both sides. How is it, my lord?
  Osr. How is't, Laertes?
  Laer. Why, as a woodcock to mine o
wn springe, Osric.
    I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.
  Ham. How does the Queen?
  K
ing. She sounds to see them bleed.
  Queen. No, no! the drink, the drink! O my dear Hamlet!
    Th
e drink, the drink! I am poison'd.                 [Dies.]
  Ham. O villany! Ho! let the door be lo
ck'd.
    Treachery! Seek it out.
                                                [Laertes falls.]

  Laer. It is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain;
    No medicine in the world can do thee good
.
    In thee there is not half an hour of life.
    The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
 
   Unbated and envenom'd. The foul practice
    Hath turn'd itself on me. Lo, here I lie,
    Neve
r to rise again. Thy mother's poison'd.
    I can no more. The King, the King's to blame.
  Ham. T
he point envenom'd too?
    Then, venom, to thy work.                    Hurts the King.
  All. Tr
eason! treason!
  King. O, yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt.
  Ham. Here, thou incestuous, mu
rd'rous, damned Dane,
    Drink off this potion! Is thy union here?
    Follow my mother.         
                        King dies.
  Laer. He is justly serv'd.
    It is a poison temper'd by him
self.
    Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet.
    Mine and my father's death come not upon
 thee,
    Nor thine on me!                                       Dies.
  Ham. Heaven make thee fr
ee of it! I follow thee.
    I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!
    You that look pale and
 tremble at this chance,
    That are but mutes or audience to this act,
    Had I but time (as th
is fell sergeant, Death,
    Is strict in his arrest) O, I could tell you-
    But let it be. Hora
tio, I am dead;
    Thou liv'st; report me and my cause aright
    To the unsatisfied.
  Hor. Nev
er believe it.
    I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.
    Here's yet some liquor left.
  Ham
. As th'art a man,
    Give me the cup. Let go! By heaven, I'll ha't.
    O good Horatio, what a w
ounded name
    (Things standing thus unknown) shall live behind me!
    If thou didst ever hold m
e in thy heart,
    Absent thee from felicity awhile,
    And in this harsh world draw thy breath 
in pain,
    To tell my story.         [March afar off, and shot within.]
    What warlike noise i
s this?
  Osr. Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
    To the ambassadors of England
 gives
    This warlike volley.
  Ham. O, I die, Horatio!
    The potent poison quite o'ercrows m
y spirit.
    I cannot live to hear the news from England,
    But I do prophesy th' election ligh
ts
    On Fortinbras. He has my dying voice.
    So tell him, with th' occurrents, more and less,

    Which have solicited- the rest is silence.             Dies.
  Hor. Now cracks a noble heart. 
Good night, sweet prince,
    And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
                       
                          [March within.]
    Why does the drum come hither?

    Enter Fortinbra
s and English Ambassadors, with Drum,
                  Colours, and Attendants.

  Fort. Where i
s this sight?
  Hor. What is it you will see?
    If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
 
 Fort. This quarry cries on havoc. O proud Death,
    What feast is toward in thine eternal cell
 
   That thou so many princes at a shot
    So bloodily hast struck.
  Ambassador. The sight is dis
mal;
    And our affairs from England come too late.
    The ears are senseless that should give u
s hearing
    To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd
    That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are d
ead.
    Where should we have our thanks?
  Hor. Not from his mouth,
    Had it th' ability of li
fe to thank you.
    He never gave commandment for their death.
    But since, so jump upon this b
loody question,
    You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
    Are here arriv'd, give ord
er that these bodies
    High on a stage be placed to the view;
    And let me speak to the yet un
knowing world
    How these things came about. So shall you hear
    Of carnal, bloody and unnatur
al acts;
    Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters;
    Of deaths put on by cunning and forc'
d cause;
    And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
    Fall'n on th' inventors' heads. All this ca
n I
    Truly deliver.
  Fort. Let us haste to hear it,
    And call the noblest to the audience.

    For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.
    I have some rights of memory in this kingdom
 
   Which now, to claim my vantage doth invite me.
  Hor. Of that I shall have also cause to speak,

    And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more.
    But let this same be presently perform'd
,
    Even while men's minds are wild, lest more mischance
    On plots and errors happen.
  Fort
. Let four captains
    Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage;
    For he was likely, had he bee
n put on,
    To have prov'd most royally; and for his passage
    The soldiers' music and the rit
es of war
    Speak loudly for him.
    Take up the bodies. Such a sight as this
    Becomes the 
field but here shows much amiss.
    Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
            Exeunt marching; afte
r the which a peal of ordnance
                                                   are shot off.

Hamlet, Prince of Denmark




ACT I. Scene I.
Elsinore. A platform before t
he Castle.

Enter two Sentinels-[first,] Francisco, [who paces up and down
at his post; then] Ber
nardo, [who approaches him].

  Ber. Who's there?
  Fran. Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourse
lf.
  Ber. Long live the King!
  Fran. Bernardo?
  Ber. He.
  Fran. You come most carefully upon
 your hour.
  Ber. 'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.
  Fran. For this relief muc
h thanks. 'Tis bitter cold,
    And I am sick at heart.
  Ber. Have you had quiet guard?
  Fran. 
Not a mouse stirring.
  Ber. Well, good night.
    If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
    The 
rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.

                    Enter Horatio and Marcellus.

  Fr
an. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?
  Hor. Friends to this ground.
  Mar. And liegem
en to the Dane.
  Fran. Give you good night.
  Mar. O, farewell, honest soldier.
    Who hath rel
iev'd you?
  Fran. Bernardo hath my place.
    Give you good night.                               
    Exit.
  Mar. Holla, Bernardo!
  Ber. Say-
    What, is Horatio there ?
  Hor. A piece of him
.
  Ber. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.
  Mar. What, has this thing appear'd again to-
night?
  Ber. I have seen nothing.
  Mar. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
    And will not let
 belief take hold of him
    Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.
    Therefore I have e
ntreated him along,
    With us to watch the minutes of this night,
    That, if again this appari
tion come,
    He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
  Hor. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
  B
er. Sit down awhile,
    And let us once again assail your ears,
    That are so fortified against
 our story,
    What we two nights have seen.
  Hor. Well, sit we down,
    And let us hear Berna
rdo speak of this.
  Ber. Last night of all,
    When yond same star that's westward from the pole

    Had made his course t' illume that part of heaven
    Where now it burns, Marcellus and mysel
f,
    The bell then beating one-

                        Enter Ghost.

  Mar. Peace! break th
ee off! Look where it comes again!
  Ber. In the same figure, like the King that's dead.
  Mar. Th
ou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
  Ber. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.
  Hor
. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.
  Ber. It would be spoke to.
  Mar. Question it, 
Horatio.
  Hor. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night
    Together with that fair and war
like form
    In which the majesty of buried Denmark
    Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge t
hee speak!
  Mar. It is offended.
  Ber. See, it stalks away!
  Hor. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge
 thee speak!
                                                     Exit Ghost.
  Mar. 'Tis gone and
 will not answer.
  Ber. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale.
    Is not this something mo
re than fantasy?
    What think you on't?
  Hor. Before my God, I might not this believe
    With
out the sensible and true avouch
    Of mine own eyes.
  Mar. Is it not like the King?
  Hor. As 
thou art to thyself.
    Such was the very armour he had on
    When he th' ambitious Norway comba
ted.
    So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,
    He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.

    'Tis strange.
  Mar. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
    With martial stalk ha
th he gone by our watch.
  Hor. In what particular thought to work I know not;
    But, in the gro
ss and scope of my opinion,
    This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
  Mar. Good now, si
t down, and tell me he that knows,
    Why this same strict and most observant watch
    So nightl
y toils the subject of the land,
    And why such daily cast of brazen cannon
    And foreign mart
 for implements of war;
    Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
    Does not divide t
he Sunday from the week.
    What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
    Doth make the night 
joint-labourer with the day?
    Who is't that can inform me?
  Hor. That can I.
    At least, th
e whisper goes so. Our last king,
    Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
    Was, as you kno
w, by Fortinbras of Norway,
    Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
    Dar'd to the comba
t; in which our valiant Hamlet
    (For so this side of our known world esteem'd him)
    Did slay
 this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,
    Well ratified by law and heraldry,
    Did forfeit
, with his life, all those his lands
    Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror;
    Against t
he which a moiety competent
    Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
    To the inheritance o
f Fortinbras,
    Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant
    And carriage of the article
 design'd,
    His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
    Of unimproved mettle hot and fu
ll,
    Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,
    Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,

    For food and diet, to some enterprise
    That hath a stomach in't; which is no other,
    As
 it doth well appear unto our state,
    But to recover of us, by strong hand
    And terms compul
satory, those foresaid lands
    So by his father lost; and this, I take it,
    Is the main motiv
e of our preparations,
    The source of this our watch, and the chief head
    Of this post-haste
 and romage in the land.
  Ber. I think it be no other but e'en so.
    Well may it sort that this
 portentous figure
    Comes armed through our watch, so like the King
    That was and is the que
stion of these wars.
  Hor. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
    In the most high and palmy
 state of Rome,
    A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
    The graves stood tenantless, and t
he sheeted dead
    Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;
    As stars with trains of fire, 
and dews of blood,
    Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
    Upon whose influence Neptune's
 empire stands
    Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.
    And even the like precurse of fie
rce events,
    As harbingers preceding still the fates
    And prologue to the omen coming on,
 
   Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
    Unto our climature and countrymen.

          
            Enter Ghost again.

    But soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again!
    I'll cross it
, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!
                                               Spreads his ar
ms.
    If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
    Speak to me.
    If there be any good thing 
to be done,
    That may to thee do ease, and, race to me,
    Speak to me.
    If thou art privy
 to thy country's fate,
    Which happily foreknowing may avoid,
    O, speak!
    Or if thou has
t uphoarded in thy life
    Extorted treasure in the womb of earth
    (For which, they say, you s
pirits oft walk in death),
                                                 The cock crows.
    Sp
eak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!
  Mar. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
  H
or. Do, if it will not stand.
  Ber. 'Tis here!
  Hor. 'Tis here!
  Mar. 'Tis gone!
            
                                         Exit Ghost.
    We do it wrong, being so majestical,
    
To offer it the show of violence;
    For it is as the air, invulnerable,
    And our vain blows m
alicious mockery.
  Ber. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
  Hor. And then it started, li
ke a guilty thing
    Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
    The cock, that is the trumpet to th
e morn,
    Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
    Awake the god of day; and at his wa
rning,
    Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
    Th' extravagant and erring spirit hies
  
  To his confine; and of the truth herein
    This present object made probation.
  Mar. It faded 
on the crowing of the cock.
    Some say that ever, 'gainst that season comes
    Wherein our Savi
our's birth is celebrated,
    The bird of dawning singeth all night long;
    And then, they say,
 no spirit dare stir abroad,
    The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,
    No fairy ta
kes, nor witch hath power to charm,
    So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
  Hor. So have I 
heard and do in part believe it.
    But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
    Walks o'er the
 dew of yon high eastward hill.
    Break we our watch up; and by my advice
    Let us impart what
 we have seen to-night
    Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
    This spirit, dumb to us, will
 speak to him.
    Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
    As needful in our loves, fitt
ing our duty?
    Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
    Where we shall find him most con
veniently.           Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A room of state in the Castle.

Flouris
h. [Enter Claudius, King of Denmark, Gertrude the Queen,
Hamlet,
Polonius, Laertes and his sister 
Ophelia, [Voltemand, Cornelius,]
Lords Attendant.

  King. Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother'
s death
    The memory be green, and that it us befitted
    To bear our hearts in grief, and our 
whole kingdom
    To be contracted in one brow of woe,
    Yet so far hath discretion fought with 
nature
    That we with wisest sorrow think on him
    Together with remembrance of ourselves.
  
  Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
    Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,

    Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,
    With an auspicious, and a dropping eye,
    With m
irth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,
    In equal scale weighing delight and dole,
    Tak
en to wife; nor have we herein barr'd
    Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
    With thi
s affair along. For all, our thanks.
    Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
    Holding
 a weak supposal of our worth,
    Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
    Our state to b
e disjoint and out of frame,
    Colleagued with this dream of his advantage,
    He hath not fail
'd to pester us with message
    Importing the surrender of those lands
    Lost by his father, wi
th all bands of law,
    To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
    Now for ourself and for
 this time of meeting.
    Thus much the business is: we have here writ
    To Norway, uncle of yo
ung Fortinbras,
    Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears
    Of this his nephew's purpose, to 
suppress
    His further gait herein, in that the levies,
    The lists, and full proportions are 
all made
    Out of his subject; and we here dispatch
    You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,

    For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,
    Giving to you no further personal power
    
To business with the King, more than the scope
    Of these dilated articles allow.            [Giv
es a paper.]
    Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
  Cor., Volt. In that, and all th
ings, will we show our duty.
  King. We doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell.
                     
            Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius.
    And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
    Yo
u told us of some suit. What is't, Laertes?
    You cannot speak of reason to the Dane
    And los
e your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
    That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
    
The head is not more native to the heart,
    The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
    Than is
 the throne of Denmark to thy father.
    What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
  Laer. My dread lord,

    Your leave and favour to return to France;
    From whence though willingly I came to Denmark

    To show my duty in your coronation,
    Yet now I must confess, that duty done,
    My though
ts and wishes bend again toward France
    And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
  King.
 Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
  Pol. He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow l
eave
    By laboursome petition, and at last
    Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent.
    I do
 beseech you give him leave to go.
  King. Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,
    And thy
 best graces spend it at thy will!
    But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son-
  Ham. [aside] A lit
tle more than kin, and less than kind!
  King. How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
  Ham.
 Not so, my lord. I am too much i' th' sun.
  Queen. Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
   
 And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
    Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
    See
k for thy noble father in the dust.
    Thou know'st 'tis common. All that lives must die,
    Pas
sing through nature to eternity.
  Ham. Ay, madam, it is common.
  Queen. If it be,
    Why seems
 it so particular with thee?
  Ham. Seems, madam, Nay, it is. I know not 'seems.'
    'Tis not alo
ne my inky cloak, good mother,
    Nor customary suits of solemn black,
    Nor windy suspiration 
of forc'd breath,
    No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
    Nor the dejected havior of the vi
sage,
    Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
    'That can denote me truly. These in
deed seem,
    For they are actions that a man might play;
    But I have that within which passet
h show-
    These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
  King. 'Tis sweet and commendable in yo
ur nature, Hamlet,
    To give these mourning duties to your father;
    But you must know, your f
ather lost a father;
    That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
    In filial obligati
on for some term
    To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever
    In obstinate condolement is a co
urse
    Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief;
    It shows a will most incorrect to heaven
,
    A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
    An understanding simple and unschool'd;
    For 
what we know must be, and is as common
    As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
    Why should w
e in our peevish opposition
    Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
    A fault against
 the dead, a fault to nature,
    To reason most absurd, whose common theme
    Is death of father
s, and who still hath cried,
    From the first corse till he that died to-day,
    'This must be 
so.' We pray you throw to earth
    This unprevailing woe, and think of us
    As of a father; for
 let the world take note
    You are the most immediate to our throne,
    And with no less nobili
ty of love
    Than that which dearest father bears his son
    Do I impart toward you. For your i
ntent
    In going back to school in Wittenberg,
    It is most retrograde to our desire;
    And
 we beseech you, bend you to remain
    Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
    Our chiefest
 courtier, cousin, and our son.
  Queen. Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.
    I pray t
hee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.
  Ham. I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
  King. Why
, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.
    Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come.
    This gentle and u
nforc'd accord of Hamlet
    Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,
    No jocund health that
 Denmark drinks to-day
    But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
    And the King's rouse
 the heaven shall bruit again,
    Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.
                        
        Flourish. Exeunt all but Hamlet.
  Ham. O that this too too solid flesh would melt,
    Th
aw, and resolve itself into a dew!
    Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
    His canon 'gainst
 self-slaughter! O God! God!
    How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
    Seem to me all the u
ses of this world!
    Fie on't! ah, fie! 'Tis an unweeded garden
    That grows to seed; things r
ank and gross in nature
    Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
    But two months dea
d! Nay, not so much, not two.
    So excellent a king, that was to this
    Hyperion to a satyr; s
o loving to my mother
    That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
    Visit her face too roug
hly. Heaven and earth!
    Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him
    As if increase of appet
ite had grown
    By what it fed on; and yet, within a month-
    Let me not think on't! Frailty, 
thy name is woman!-
    A little month, or ere those shoes were old
    With which she followed my
 poor father's body
    Like Niobe, all tears- why she, even she
    (O God! a beast that wants di
scourse of reason
    Would have mourn'd longer) married with my uncle;
    My father's brother, b
ut no more like my father
    Than I to Hercules. Within a month,
    Ere yet the salt of most unr
ighteous tears
    Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
    She married. O, most wicked speed
, to post
    With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
    It is not, nor it cannot come to good.

    But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue!

          Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and Bern
ardo.

  Hor. Hail to your lordship!
  Ham. I am glad to see you well.
    Horatio!- or I do for
get myself.
  Hor. The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
  Ham. Sir, my good friend- I'll
 change that name with you.
    And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?
    Marcellus?
  Mar.
 My good lord!
  Ham. I am very glad to see you.- [To Bernardo] Good even, sir.-

    But what, i
n faith, make you from Wittenberg?
  Hor. A truant disposition, good my lord.
  Ham. I would not h
ear your enemy say so,
    Nor shall you do my ear that violence
    To make it truster of your ow
n report
    Against yourself. I know you are no truant.
    But what is your affair in Elsinore?

    We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
  Hor. My lord, I came to see your father's fune
ral.
  Ham. I prithee do not mock me, fellow student.
    I think it was to see my mother's weddin
g.
  Hor. Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.
  Ham. Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'
d meats
    Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
    Would I had met my dearest foe in he
aven
    Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
    My father- methinks I see my father.
  Hor. O,
 where, my lord?
  Ham. In my mind's eye, Horatio.
  Hor. I saw him once. He was a goodly king.
 
 Ham. He was a man, take him for all in all.
    I shall not look upon his like again.
  Hor. My l
ord, I think I saw him yesternight.
  Ham. Saw? who?
  Hor. My lord, the King your father.
  Ham.
 The King my father?
  Hor. Season your admiration for a while
    With an attent ear, till I may 
deliver
    Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
    This marvel to you.
  Ham. For God's love le
t me hear!
  Hor. Two nights together had these gentlemen
    (Marcellus and Bernardo) on their wa
tch
    In the dead vast and middle of the night
    Been thus encount'red. A figure like your fat
her,
    Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
    Appears before them and with solemn march
    Goes
 slow and stately by them. Thrice he walk'd
    By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
    Wi
thin his truncheon's length; whilst they distill'd
    Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
    S
tand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
    In dreadful secrecy impart they did,
    And I with
 them the third night kept the watch;
    Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
    Form of 
the thing, each word made true and good,
    The apparition comes. I knew your father.
    These h
ands are not more like.
  Ham. But where was this?
  Mar. My lord, upon the platform where we watc
h'd.
  Ham. Did you not speak to it?
  Hor. My lord, I did;
    But answer made it none. Yet once
 methought
    It lifted up it head and did address
    Itself to motion, like as it would speak;

    But even then the morning cock crew loud,
    And at the sound it shrunk in haste away
    An
d vanish'd from our sight.
  Ham. 'Tis very strange.
  Hor. As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis t
rue;
    And we did think it writ down in our duty
    To let you know of it.
  Ham. Indeed, inde
ed, sirs. But this troubles me.
    Hold you the watch to-night?
  Both [Mar. and Ber.] We do, my 
lord.
  Ham. Arm'd, say you?
  Both. Arm'd, my lord.
  Ham. From top to toe?
  Both. My lord, fr
om head to foot.
  Ham. Then saw you not his face?
  Hor. O, yes, my lord! He wore his beaver up.

  Ham. What, look'd he frowningly.
  Hor. A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
  Ham. Pale
 or red?
  Hor. Nay, very pale.
  Ham. And fix'd his eyes upon you?
  Hor. Most constantly.
  Ha
m. I would I had been there.
  Hor. It would have much amaz'd you.
  Ham. Very like, very like. St
ay'd it long?
  Hor. While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
  Both. Longer, longer.

  Hor. Not when I saw't.
  Ham. His beard was grizzled- no?
  Hor. It was, as I have seen it in hi
s life,
    A sable silver'd.
  Ham. I will watch to-night.
    Perchance 'twill walk again.
  H
or. I warr'nt it will.
  Ham. If it assume my noble father's person,
    I'll speak to it, though 
hell itself should gape
    And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
    If you have hitherto con
ceal'd this sight,
    Let it be tenable in your silence still;
    And whatsoever else shall hap 
to-night,
    Give it an understanding but no tongue.
    I will requite your loves. So, fare you 
well.
    Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
    I'll visit you.
  All. Our duty to you
r honour.
  Ham. Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell.
                                        Exe
unt [all but Hamlet].
    My father's spirit- in arms? All is not well.
    I doubt some foul play
. Would the night were come!
    Till then sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,
    Though al
l the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
Exit.




Scene III.
Elsinore. A room in the house
 of Polonius.

Enter Laertes and Ophelia.

  Laer. My necessaries are embark'd. Farewell.
    A
nd, sister, as the winds give benefit
    And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
    But let me he
ar from you.
  Oph. Do you doubt that?
  Laer. For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,
    Ho
ld it a fashion, and a toy in blood;
    A violet in the youth of primy nature,
    Forward, not p
ermanent- sweet, not lasting;
    The perfume and suppliance of a minute;
    No more.
  Oph. No 
more but so?
  Laer. Think it no more.
    For nature crescent does not grow alone
    In thews a
nd bulk; but as this temple waxes,
    The inward service of the mind and soul
    Grows wide with
al. Perhaps he loves you now,
    And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
    The virtue of his w
ill; but you must fear,
    His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
    For he himself is 
subject to his birth.
    He may not, as unvalued persons do,
    Carve for himself, for on his ch
oice depends
    The safety and health of this whole state,
    And therefore must his choice be c
ircumscrib'd
    Unto the voice and yielding of that body
    Whereof he is the head. Then if he s
ays he loves you,
    It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
    As he in his particular act and
 place
    May give his saying deed; which is no further
    Than the main voice of Denmark goes w
ithal.
    Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain
    If with too credent ear you list his s
ongs,
    Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
    To his unmast'red importunity.
   
 Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
    And keep you in the rear of your affection,
    Ou
t of the shot and danger of desire.
    The chariest maid is prodigal enough
    If she unmask her
 beauty to the moon.
    Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes.
    The canker galls the inf
ants of the spring
    Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd,
    And in the morn and liquid d
ew of youth
    Contagious blastments are most imminent.
    Be wary then; best safety lies in fea
r.
    Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
  Oph. I shall th' effect of this good lesso
n keep
    As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
    Do not as some ungracious pastors do
,
    Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven,
    Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine
,
    Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads
    And recks not his own rede.
  Laer. O, fe
ar me not!

                       Enter Polonius.

    I stay too long. But here my father come
s.
    A double blessing is a double grace;
    Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
  Pol. Yet h
ere, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame!
    The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
    And y
ou are stay'd for. There- my blessing with thee!
    And these few precepts in thy memory
    Look
 thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
    Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.
    Be t
hou familiar, but by no means vulgar:
    Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
    G
rapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel;
    But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
   
 Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware
    Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,
    Be
ar't that th' opposed may beware of thee.
    Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice;
    Tak
e each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
    Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
    But
 not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
    For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
    And they 
in France of the best rank and station
    Are most select and generous, chief in that.
    Neithe
r a borrower nor a lender be;
    For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
    And borrowing dul
ls the edge of husbandry.
    This above all- to thine own self be true,
    And it must follow, a
s the night the day,
    Thou canst not then be false to any man.
    Farewell. My blessing season
 this in thee!
  Laer. Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
  Pol. The time invites you. Go, y
our servants tend.
  Laer. Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well
    What I have said to you.
  Op
h. 'Tis in my memory lock'd,
    And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
  Laer. Farewell.     
                                     Exit.
  Pol. What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?
  Oph. 
So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
  Pol. Marry, well bethought!
    'Tis told me 
he hath very oft of late
    Given private time to you, and you yourself
    Have of your audience
 been most free and bounteous.
    If it be so- as so 'tis put on me,
    And that in way of cauti
on- I must tell you
    You do not understand yourself so clearly
    As it behooves my daughter a
nd your honour.
    What is between you? Give me up the truth.
  Oph. He hath, my lord, of late ma
de many tenders
    Of his affection to me.
  Pol. Affection? Pooh! You speak like a green girl,

    Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
    Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
  Op
h. I do not know, my lord, what I should think,
  Pol. Marry, I will teach you! Think yourself a ba
by
    That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
    Which are not sterling. Tender yourself
 more dearly,
    Or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
    Running it thus) you'll tender
 me a fool.
  Oph. My lord, he hath importun'd me with love
    In honourable fashion.
  Pol. Ay,
 fashion you may call it. Go to, go to!
  Oph. And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,

    With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
  Pol. Ay, springes to catch woodcocks! I do know,
  
  When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
    Lends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter,
 
   Giving more light than heat, extinct in both
    Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
    
You must not take for fire. From this time
    Be something scanter of your maiden presence.
    S
et your entreatments at a higher rate
    Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
    Believe s
o much in him, that he is young,
    And with a larger tether may he walk
    Than may be given yo
u. In few, Ophelia,
    Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
    Not of that dye which t
heir investments show,
    But mere implorators of unholy suits,
    Breathing like sanctified and
 pious bawds,
    The better to beguile. This is for all:
    I would not, in plain terms, from th
is time forth
    Have you so slander any moment leisure
    As to give words or talk with the Lor
d Hamlet.
    Look to't, I charge you. Come your ways.
  Oph. I shall obey, my lord.
            
                                             Exeunt.




Scene IV.
Elsinore. The platform befo
re the Castle.

Enter Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus.

  Ham. The air bites shrewdly; it is very
 cold.
  Hor. It is a nipping and an eager air.
  Ham. What hour now?
  Hor. I think it lacks of 
twelve.
  Mar. No, it is struck.
  Hor. Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws near the season
   
 Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
                   A flourish of trumpets, and two piece
s go off.
    What does this mean, my lord?
  Ham. The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse
,
    Keeps wassail, and the swagg'ring upspring reels,
    And, as he drains his draughts of Rhen
ish down,
    The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out
    The triumph of his pledge.
  Hor. Is i
t a custom?
  Ham. Ay, marry, is't;
    But to my mind, though I am native here
    And to the ma
nner born, it is a custom
    More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
    This heavy-head
ed revel east and west
    Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations;
    They clip us drunkard
s and with swinish phrase
    Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
    From our achievements, th
ough perform'd at height,
    The pith and marrow of our attribute.
    So oft it chances in parti
cular men
    That, for some vicious mole of nature in them,
    As in their birth,- wherein they 
are not guilty,
    Since nature cannot choose his origin,-
    By the o'ergrowth of some complexi
on,
    Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
    Or by some habit that too much o'erle
avens
    The form of plausive manners, that these men
    Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defec
t,
    Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,
    Their virtues else- be they as pure as grace,

    As infinite as man may undergo-
    Shall in the general censure take corruption
    From th
at particular fault. The dram of e'il
    Doth all the noble substance often dout To his own scanda
l.

                         Enter Ghost.

  Hor. Look, my lord, it comes!
  Ham. Angels and mi
nisters of grace defend us!
    Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
    Bring with thee a
irs from heaven or blasts from hell,
    Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
    Thou com'st in s
uch a questionable shape
    That I will speak to thee. I'll call thee Hamlet,
    King, father, r
oyal Dane. O, answer me?
    Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell
    Why thy canoniz'd bones, 
hearsed in death,
    Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre
    Wherein we saw thee quietl
y inurn'd,
    Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws
    To cast thee up again. What may this me
an
    That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,
    Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,

    Making night hideous, and we fools of nature
    So horridly to shake our disposition
    Wi
th thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
    Say, why is this? wherefore? What should we do?
 
                                          Ghost beckons Hamlet.
  Hor. It beckons you to go away wi
th it,
    As if it some impartment did desire
    To you alone.
  Mar. Look with what courteous 
action
    It waves you to a more removed ground.
    But do not go with it!
  Hor. No, by no mea
ns!
  Ham. It will not speak. Then will I follow it.
  Hor. Do not, my lord!
  Ham. Why, what sho
uld be the fear?
    I do not set my life at a pin's fee;
    And for my soul, what can it do to t
hat,
    Being a thing immortal as itself?
    It waves me forth again. I'll follow it.
  Hor. Wh
at if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
    Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
    That 
beetles o'er his base into the sea,
    And there assume some other, horrible form
    Which might
 deprive your sovereignty of reason
    And draw you into madness? Think of it.
    The very place
 puts toys of desperation,
    Without more motive, into every brain
    That looks so many fadoms
 to the sea
    And hears it roar beneath.
  Ham. It waves me still.
    Go on. I'll follow thee.

  Mar. You shall not go, my lord.
  Ham. Hold off your hands!
  Hor. Be rul'd. You shall not go.

  Ham. My fate cries out
    And makes each petty artire in this body
    As hardy as the Nemean
 lion's nerve.
                                                [Ghost beckons.]

    Still am I c
all'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
    By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!-
    I say, awa
y!- Go on. I'll follow thee.
                                        Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet.
  Ho
r. He waxes desperate with imagination.
  Mar. Let's follow. 'Tis not fit thus to obey him.
  Hor.
 Have after. To what issue will this come?
  Mar. Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
  H
or. Heaven will direct it.
  Mar. Nay, let's follow him.
                                         
                Exeunt.




Scene V.
Elsinore. The Castle. Another part of the fortifications.


Enter Ghost and Hamlet.

  Ham. Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak! I'll go no further.
  Ghost
. Mark me.
  Ham. I will.
  Ghost. My hour is almost come,
    When I to sulph'rous and tormentin
g flames
    Must render up myself.
  Ham. Alas, poor ghost!
  Ghost. Pity me not, but lend thy s
erious hearing
    To what I shall unfold.
  Ham. Speak. I am bound to hear.
  Ghost. So art thou
 to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
  Ham. What?
  Ghost. I am thy father's spirit,
    Doom'd for
 a certain term to walk the night,
    And for the day confin'd to fast in fires,
    Till the fou
l crimes done in my days of nature
    Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid
    To tell
 the secrets of my prison house,
    I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
    Would harrow up
 thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
    Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
  
  Thy knotted and combined locks to part,
    And each particular hair to stand on end
    Like qu
ills upon the fretful porcupine.
    But this eternal blazon must not be
    To ears of flesh and 
blood. List, list, O, list!
    If thou didst ever thy dear father love-
  Ham. O God!
  Ghost. R
evenge his foul and most unnatural murther.
  Ham. Murther?
  Ghost. Murther most foul, as in the 
best it is;
    But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.
  Ham. Haste me to know't, that I, wit
h wings as swift
    As meditation or the thoughts of love,
    May sweep to my revenge.
  Ghost.
 I find thee apt;
    And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
    That rots itself in ease o
n Lethe wharf,
    Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.
    'Tis given out that, slee
ping in my orchard,
    A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark
    Is by a forged process
 of my death
    Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth,
    The serpent that did sting thy fat
her's life
    Now wears his crown.
  Ham. O my prophetic soul!
    My uncle?
  Ghost. Ay, that 
incestuous, that adulterate beast,
    With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts-
    O wi
cked wit and gifts, that have the power
    So to seduce!- won to his shameful lust
    The will o
f my most seeming-virtuous queen.
    O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there,
    From me, whose l
ove was of that dignity
    That it went hand in hand even with the vow
    I made to her in marri
age, and to decline
    Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
    To those of mine!
    But
 virtue, as it never will be mov'd,
    Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
    So lust
, though to a radiant angel link'd,
    Will sate itself in a celestial bed
    And prey on garbag
e.
    But soft! methinks I scent the morning air.
    Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard
,
    My custom always of the afternoon,
    Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
    With juice 
of cursed hebona in a vial,
    And in the porches of my ears did pour
    The leperous distilment
; whose effect
    Holds such an enmity with blood of man
    That swift as quicksilver it courses
 through
    The natural gates and alleys of the body,
    And with a sudden vigour it doth posset

    And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
    The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine;

    And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
    Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust
   
 All my smooth body.
    Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
    Of life, of crown, of queen
, at once dispatch'd;
    Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
    Unhous'led, disappointed, un
anel'd,
    No reckoning made, but sent to my account
    With all my imperfections on my head.
 
 Ham. O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
  Ghost. If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.

    Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
    A couch for luxury and damned incest.
    But, howsoev
er thou pursuest this act,
    Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
    Against thy mothe
r aught. Leave her to heaven,
    And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge
    To prick and sti
ng her. Fare thee well at once.
    The glowworm shows the matin to be near
    And gins to pale h
is uneffectual fire.
    Adieu, adieu, adieu! Remember me.                      Exit.

  Ham. O a
ll you host of heaven! O earth! What else?
    And shall I couple hell? Hold, hold, my heart!
    
And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
    But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?
    Ay, thou 
poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
    In this distracted globe. Remember thee?
    Yea, from t
he table of my memory
    I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
    All saws of books, all form
s, all pressures past
    That youth and observation copied there,
    And thy commandment all alo
ne shall live
    Within the book and volume of my brain,
    Unmix'd with baser matter. Yes, by h
eaven!
    O most pernicious woman!
    O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
    My table
s! Meet it is I set it down
    That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
    At least I am
 sure it may be so in Denmark.        [Writes.]
    So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word:
    
It is 'Adieu, adieu! Remember me.'
    I have sworn't.
  Hor. (within) My lord, my lord!

      
             Enter Horatio and Marcellus.

  Mar. Lord Hamlet!
  Hor. Heaven secure him!
  Ham. 
So be it!
  Mar. Illo, ho, ho, my lord!
  Ham. Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.
  Mar. How i
s't, my noble lord?
  Hor. What news, my lord?
  Mar. O, wonderful!
  Hor. Good my lord, tell it.

  Ham. No, you will reveal it.
  Hor. Not I, my lord, by heaven!
  Mar. Nor I, my lord.
  Ham. 
How say you then? Would heart of man once think it?
    But you'll be secret?
  Both. Ay, by heave
n, my lord.
  Ham. There's neer a villain dwelling in all Denmark
    But he's an arrant knave.
 
 Hor. There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
    To tell us this.
  Ham. Why, right! Y
ou are in the right!
    And so, without more circumstance at all,
    I hold it fit that we shake
 hands and part;
    You, as your business and desires shall point you,
    For every man hath bus
iness and desire,
    Such as it is; and for my own poor part,
    Look you, I'll go pray.
  Hor.
 These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
  Ham. I am sorry they offend you, heartily;
    
Yes, faith, heartily.
  Hor. There's no offence, my lord.
  Ham. Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there 
is, Horatio,
    And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
    It is an honest ghost, that 
let me tell you.
    For your desire to know what is between us,
    O'ermaster't as you may. And 
now, good friends,
    As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,
    Give me one poor request.

  Hor. What is't, my lord? We will.
  Ham. Never make known what you have seen to-night.
  Both. M
y lord, we will not.
  Ham. Nay, but swear't.
  Hor. In faith,
    My lord, not I.
  Mar. Nor I,
 my lord- in faith.
  Ham. Upon my sword.
  Mar. We have sworn, my lord, already.
  Ham. Indeed, 
upon my sword, indeed.

                 Ghost cries under the stage.

  Ghost. Swear.
  Ham. A
ha boy, say'st thou so? Art thou there, truepenny?
    Come on! You hear this fellow in the cellara
ge.
    Consent to swear.
  Hor. Propose the oath, my lord.
  Ham. Never to speak of this that yo
u have seen.
    Swear by my sword.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
  Ham. Hic et ubique? Then we'll sh
ift our ground.
    Come hither, gentlemen,
    And lay your hands again upon my sword.
    Never
 to speak of this that you have heard:
    Swear by my sword.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear by his swor
d.
  Ham. Well said, old mole! Canst work i' th' earth so fast?
    A worthy pioner! Once more rem
ove, good friends."
  Hor. O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
  Ham. And therefore as 
a stranger give it welcome.
    There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
    Than are d
reamt of in your philosophy.
    But come!
    Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
    How
 strange or odd soe'er I bear myself
    (As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
    To put an 
antic disposition on),
    That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
    With arms encumb're
d thus, or this head-shake,
    Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
    As 'Well, well, we 
know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'
    Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,
'
    Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
    That you know aught of me- this is not to do,
   
 So grace and mercy at your most need help you,
    Swear.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
            
                                       [They swear.]
  Ham. Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! So, gentl
emen,
    With all my love I do commend me to you;
    And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
    Ma
y do t' express his love and friending to you,
    God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in togeth
er;
    And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
    The time is out of joint. O cursed spite

    That ever I was born to set it right!
    Nay, come, let's go together.
                     
                                    Exeunt.

Act II. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room 
in the house of Polonius.

Enter Polonius and Reynaldo.

  Pol. Give him this money and these no
tes, Reynaldo.
  Rey. I will, my lord.
  Pol. You shall do marvell's wisely, good Reynaldo,
    B
efore You visit him, to make inquire
    Of his behaviour.
  Rey. My lord, I did intend it.
  Pol
. Marry, well said, very well said. Look you, sir,
    Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;

    And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
    What company, at what expense; and fin
ding
    By this encompassment and drift of question
    That they do know my son, come you more n
earer
    Than your particular demands will touch it.
    Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowle
dge of him;
    As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
    And in part him.' Do you mark thi
s, Reynaldo?
  Rey. Ay, very well, my lord.
  Pol. 'And in part him, but,' you may say, 'not well.

    But if't be he I mean, he's very wild
    Addicted so and so'; and there put on him
    What
 forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
    As may dishonour him- take heed of that;
    But, s
ir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips
    As are companions noted and most known
    To youth and
 liberty.
  Rey. As gaming, my lord.
  Pol. Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
    
Drabbing. You may go so far.
  Rey. My lord, that would dishonour him.
  Pol. Faith, no, as you ma
y season it in the charge.
    You must not put another scandal on him,
    That he is open to inc
ontinency.
    That's not my meaning. But breathe his faults so quaintly
    That they may seem th
e taints of liberty,
    The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
    A savageness in unreclaimed b
lood,
    Of general assault.
  Rey. But, my good lord-
  Pol. Wherefore should you do this?
  R
ey. Ay, my lord,
    I would know that.
  Pol. Marry, sir, here's my drift,
    And I believe it 
is a fetch of warrant.
    You laying these slight sullies on my son
    As 'twere a thing a littl
e soil'd i' th' working,
    Mark you,
    Your party in converse, him you would sound,
    Havin
g ever seen in the prenominate crimes
    The youth you breathe of guilty, be assur'd
    He close
s with you in this consequence:
    'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman'-
    According 
to the phrase or the addition
    Of man and country-
  Rey. Very good, my lord.
  Pol. And then,
 sir, does 'a this- 'a does- What was I about to
say?
    By the mass, I was about to say somethin
g! Where did I leave?
  Rey. At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,' and
    gentleman.
'
  Pol. At 'closes in the consequence'- Ay, marry!
    He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman.
  
  I saw him yesterday, or t'other day,
    Or then, or then, with such or such; and, as you say,
 
   There was 'a gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
    There falling out at tennis'; or perchance,

    'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'
    Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
    See you no
w-
    Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth;
    And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,

    With windlasses and with assays of bias,
    By indirections find directions out.
    So, by
 my former lecture and advice,
    Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?
  Rey. My lord, I 
have.
  Pol. God b' wi' ye, fare ye well!
  Rey. Good my lord!                                    
[Going.]
  Pol. Observe his inclination in yourself.
  Rey. I shall, my lord.
  Pol. And let him 
ply his music.
  Rey. Well, my lord.
  Pol. Farewell!
                                           
       Exit Reynaldo.

                       Enter Ophelia.

    How now, Ophelia? What's the m
atter?
  Oph. O my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
  Pol. With what, i' th' name of God?

  Oph. My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
    Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac'd,
  
  No hat upon his head, his stockings foul'd,
    Ungart'red, and down-gyved to his ankle;
    Pal
e as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,
    And with a look so piteous in purport
    As if
 he had been loosed out of hell
    To speak of horrors- he comes before me.
  Pol. Mad for thy lo
ve?
  Oph. My lord, I do not know,
    But truly I do fear it.
  Pol. What said he?
  Oph. He to
ok me by the wrist and held me hard;
    Then goes he to the length of all his arm,
    And, with 
his other hand thus o'er his brow,
    He falls to such perusal of my face
    As he would draw it
. Long stay'd he so.
    At last, a little shaking of mine arm,
    And thrice his head thus wavin
g up and down,
    He rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound
    As it did seem to shatter all his 
bulk
    And end his being. That done, he lets me go,
    And with his head over his shoulder turn
'd
    He seem'd to find his way without his eyes,
    For out o' doors he went without their help

    And to the last bended their light on me.
  Pol. Come, go with me. I will go seek the King.

    This is the very ecstasy of love,
    Whose violent property fordoes itself
    And leads the 
will to desperate undertakings
    As oft as any passion under heaven
    That does afflict our na
tures. I am sorry.
    What, have you given him any hard words of late?
  Oph. No, my good lord; b
ut, as you did command,
    I did repel his letters and denied
    His access to me.
  Pol. That 
hath made him mad.
    I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
    I had not quoted him. I f
ear'd he did but trifle
    And meant to wrack thee; but beshrew my jealousy!
    By heaven, it is
 as proper to our age
    To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
    As it is common for the you
nger sort
    To lack discretion. Come, go we to the King.
    This must be known; which, being ke
pt close, might move
    More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
    Come.
                  
                                       Exeunt.

Scene II.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Flou
rish. [Enter King and Queen, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern,
cum aliis.

  King. Welcome, dear Rose
ncrantz and Guildenstern.
    Moreover that we much did long to see you,
    The need we have to u
se you did provoke
    Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
    Of Hamlet's transformation.
 So I call it,
    Sith nor th' exterior nor the inward man
    Resembles that it was. What it sho
uld be,
    More than his father's death, that thus hath put him
    So much from th' understandin
g of himself,
    I cannot dream of. I entreat you both
    That, being of so young days brought u
p with him,
    And since so neighbour'd to his youth and haviour,
    That you vouchsafe your res
t here in our court
    Some little time; so by your companies
    To draw him on to pleasures, an
d to gather
    So much as from occasion you may glean,
    Whether aught to us unknown afflicts h
im thus
    That, open'd, lies within our remedy.
  Queen. Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of 
you,
    And sure I am two men there are not living
    To whom he more adheres. If it will please
 you
    To show us so much gentry and good will
    As to expend your time with us awhile
    Fo
r the supply and profit of our hope,
    Your visitation shall receive such thanks
    As fits a k
ing's remembrance.
  Ros. Both your Majesties
    Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
 
   Put your dread pleasures more into command
    Than to entreaty.
  Guil. But we both obey,
   
 And here give up ourselves, in the full bent,
    To lay our service freely at your feet,
    To 
be commanded.
  King. Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
  Queen. Thanks, Guildenstern a
nd gentle Rosencrantz.
    And I beseech you instantly to visit
    My too much changed son.- Go, 
some of you,
    And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
  Guil. Heavens make our presence and 
our practices
    Pleasant and helpful to him!
  Queen. Ay, amen!
                 Exeunt Rosencr
antz and Guildenstern, [with some
                                                    Attendants].


                         Enter Polonius.

  Pol. Th' ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
  
  Are joyfully return'd.
  King. Thou still hast been the father of good news.
  Pol. Have I, my l
ord? Assure you, my good liege,
    I hold my duty as I hold my soul,
    Both to my God and to my
 gracious king;
    And I do think- or else this brain of mine
    Hunts not the trail of policy s
o sure
    As it hath us'd to do- that I have found
    The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
  King
. O, speak of that! That do I long to hear.
  Pol. Give first admittance to th' ambassadors.
    M
y news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
  King. Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.

                                                [Exit Polonius.]
    He tells me, my dear Gertrud
e, he hath found
    The head and source of all your son's distemper.
  Queen. I doubt it is no ot
her but the main,
    His father's death and our o'erhasty marriage.
  King. Well, we shall sift h
im.

              Enter Polonius, Voltemand, and Cornelius.

    Welcome, my good friends.
   
 Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?
  Volt. Most fair return of greetings and desires.

    Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
    His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
    To 
be a preparation 'gainst the Polack,
    But better look'd into, he truly found
    It was against
 your Highness; whereat griev'd,
    That so his sickness, age, and impotence
    Was falsely born
e in hand, sends out arrests
    On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys,
    Receives rebuke fro
m Norway, and, in fine,
    Makes vow before his uncle never more
    To give th' assay of arms ag
ainst your Majesty.
    Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
    Gives him three thousand crowns
 in annual fee
    And his commission to employ those soldiers,
    So levied as before, against t
he Polack;
    With an entreaty, herein further shown,
                                           
     [Gives a paper.]
    That it might please you to give quiet pass
    Through your dominions f
or this enterprise,
    On such regards of safety and allowance
    As therein are set down.
  Ki
ng. It likes us well;
    And at our more consider'd time we'll read,
    Answer, and think upon t
his business.
    Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour.
    Go to your rest; at night w
e'll feast together.
    Most welcome home!                       Exeunt Ambassadors.
  Pol. This 
business is well ended.
    My liege, and madam, to expostulate
    What majesty should be, what d
uty is,
    Why day is day, night is night, and time is time.
    Were nothing but to waste night,
 day, and time.
    Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
    And tediousness the limbs and
 outward flourishes,
    I will be brief. Your noble son is mad.
    Mad call I it; for, to define
 true madness,
    What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
    But let that go.
  Queen. More m
atter, with less art.
  Pol. Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
    That he is mad, 'tis true: 't
is true 'tis pity;
    And pity 'tis 'tis true. A foolish figure!
    But farewell it, for I will 
use no art.
    Mad let us grant him then. And now remains
    That we find out the cause of this 
effect-
    Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
    For this effect defective comes by cause.

    Thus it remains, and the remainder thus.
    Perpend.
    I have a daughter (have while she 
is mine),
    Who in her duty and obedience, mark,
    Hath given me this. Now gather, and surmise
.
                                             [Reads] the letter.
    'To the celestial, and my s
oul's idol, the most beautified
      Ophelia,'-

    That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beaut
ified' is a vile
      phrase.
    But you shall hear. Thus:
                                    
                    [Reads.]
    'In her excellent white bosom, these, &c.'
  Queen. Came this fro
m Hamlet to her?
  Pol. Good madam, stay awhile. I will be faithful.     [Reads.]


          'D
oubt thou the stars are fire;
            Doubt that the sun doth move;
          Doubt truth to b
e a liar;
            But never doubt I love.
      'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers; I 
have not art
to
    reckon my groans; but that I love thee best, O most best,
believe
    it. Ad
ieu.
      'Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to
him,

HAMLET.'

    This
, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me;
    And more above, hath his solicitings,
    As they f
ell out by time, by means, and place,
    All given to mine ear.
  King. But how hath she
    Rec
eiv'd his love?
  Pol. What do you think of me?
  King. As of a man faithful and honourable.
  Po
l. I would fain prove so. But what might you think,
    When I had seen this hot love on the wing

    (As I perceiv'd it, I must tell you that,
    Before my daughter told me), what might you,
   
 Or my dear Majesty your queen here, think,
    If I had play'd the desk or table book,
    Or giv
en my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
    Or look'd upon this love with idle sight?
    What might
 you think? No, I went round to work
    And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
    'Lord Hamle
t is a prince, out of thy star.
    This must not be.' And then I prescripts gave her,
    That sh
e should lock herself from his resort,
    Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
    Which done,
 she took the fruits of my advice,
    And he, repulsed, a short tale to make,
    Fell into a sad
ness, then into a fast,
    Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
    Thence to a lightness, 
and, by this declension,
    Into the madness wherein now he raves,
    And all we mourn for.
  K
ing. Do you think 'tis this?
  Queen. it may be, very like.
  Pol. Hath there been such a time- I 
would fain know that-
    That I have Positively said ''Tis so,'
    When it prov'd otherwise.?
 
 King. Not that I know.
  Pol. [points to his head and shoulder] Take this from this, if
this
   
   be otherwise.
    If circumstances lead me, I will find
    Where truth is hid, though it were 
hid indeed
    Within the centre.
  King. How may we try it further?
  Pol. You know sometimes he
 walks for hours together
    Here in the lobby.
  Queen. So he does indeed.
  Pol. At such a tim
e I'll loose my daughter to him.
    Be you and I behind an arras then.
    Mark the encounter. If
 he love her not,
    And he not from his reason fall'n thereon
    Let me be no assistant for a s
tate,
    But keep a farm and carters.
  King. We will try it.

                 Enter Hamlet, r
eading on a book.

  Queen. But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
  Pol. Away, I do
 beseech you, both away
    I'll board him presently. O, give me leave.
                       Exe
unt King and Queen, [with Attendants].
    How does my good Lord Hamlet?
  Ham. Well, God-a-mercy.

  Pol. Do you know me, my lord?
  Ham. Excellent well. You are a fishmonger.
  Pol. Not I, my lo
rd.
  Ham. Then I would you were so honest a man.
  Pol. Honest, my lord?
  Ham. Ay, sir. To be h
onest, as this world goes, is to be one
man
    pick'd out of ten thousand.
  Pol. That's very tr
ue, my lord.
  Ham. For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god
    kissing carrion- H
ave you a daughter?
  Pol. I have, my lord.
  Ham. Let her not walk i' th' sun. Conception is a bl
essing, but
not
    as your daughter may conceive. Friend, look to't.
  Pol. [aside] How say you 
by that? Still harping on my daughter.
Yet
    he knew me not at first. He said I was a fishmonger
. He is
far
    gone, far gone! And truly in my youth I suff'red much
extremity
    for love- ve
ry near this. I'll speak to him again.- What do
you
    read, my lord?
  Ham. Words, words, words
.
  Pol. What is the matter, my lord?
  Ham. Between who?
  Pol. I mean, the matter that you read
, my lord.
  Ham. Slanders, sir; for the satirical rogue says here that old
men
    have grey bea
rds; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes
    purging thick amber and plum-tree gum; and that 
they have a
    plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams. All
which,
    sir, though I
 most powerfully and potently believe, yet I
hold it
    not honesty to have it thus set down; for
 you yourself, sir,
    should be old as I am if, like a crab, you could go backward.

  Pol. [as
ide] Though this be madness, yet there is a method
in't.-
   Will You walk out of the air, my lord
?
  Ham. Into my grave?
  Pol. Indeed, that is out o' th' air. [Aside] How pregnant
sometimes
  
  his replies are! a happiness that often madness hits on,
which
    reason and sanity could not s
o prosperously be delivered of.
I
    will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting
b
etween
    him and my daughter.- My honourable lord, I will most humbly
take
    my leave of you.

  Ham. You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more
    willingly part withal- except 
my life, except my life, except
my
    life,

                    Enter Rosencrantz and Guildens
tern.

  Pol. Fare you well, my lord.
  Ham. These tedious old fools!
  Pol. You go to seek the 
Lord Hamlet. There he is.
  Ros. [to Polonius] God save you, sir!
                                
                Exit [Polonius].

  Guil. My honour'd lord!
  Ros. My most dear lord!
  Ham. My 
excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern?
Ah,
    Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye bot
h?
  Ros. As the indifferent children of the earth.
  Guil. Happy in that we are not over-happy.

    On Fortune's cap we are not the very button.
  Ham. Nor the soles of her shoe?
  Ros. Neither,
 my lord.
  Ham. Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her
    favours?
  Guil. Fait
h, her privates we.
  Ham. In the secret parts of Fortune? O! most true! she is a
    strumpet. Wh
at news ?
  Ros. None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
  Ham. Then is doomsday near! B
ut your news is not true. Let me
    question more in particular. What have you, my good friends,

    deserved at the hands of Fortune that she sends you to prison
    hither?
  Guil. Prison, my l
ord?
  Ham. Denmark's a prison.
  Ros. Then is the world one.
  Ham. A goodly one; in which there
 are many confines, wards, and
    dungeons, Denmark being one o' th' worst.
  Ros. We think not s
o, my lord.
  Ham. Why, then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either
good
    or bad but th
inking makes it so. To me it is a prison.
  Ros. Why, then your ambition makes it one. 'Tis too nar
row for
your
    mind.
  Ham. O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a
    kin
g of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.
  Guil. Which dreams indeed are ambition; 
for the very substance
of
    the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
  Ham. A dream itsel
f is but a shadow.
  Ros. Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality
that
    it i
s but a shadow's shadow.
  Ham. Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and
outstretch'd
  
  heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we to th' court? for, by
my
    fay, I cannot reason.
  Both
. We'll wait upon you.
  Ham. No such matter! I will not sort you with the rest of my
    servants
; for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most
    dreadfully attended. But in the beaten way
 of friendship,
what
    make you at Elsinore?
  Ros. To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.

  Ham. Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank
you;
    and sure, dear friends, my
 thanks are too dear a halfpenny.
Were
    you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a fre
e
    visitation? Come, deal justly with me. Come, come! Nay,
speak.
  Guil. What should we say, 
my lord?
  Ham. Why, anything- but to th' purpose. You were sent for; and
    there is a kind of c
onfession in your looks, which your
modesties
    have not craft enough to colour. I know the good
 King and
Queen
    have sent for you.
  Ros. To what end, my lord?
  Ham. That you must teach m
e. But let me conjure you by the
rights
    of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by 
the
    obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear
a
    better proposer could 
charge you withal, be even and direct
with
    me, whether you were sent for or no.
  Ros. [aside
 to Guildenstern] What say you?
  Ham. [aside] Nay then, I have an eye of you.- If you love me,
ho
ld
    not off.
  Guil. My lord, we were sent for.
  Ham. I will tell you why. So shall my antici
pation prevent your
    discovery, and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no
    feather. I 
have of late- but wherefore I know not- lost all
my
    mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; an
d indeed, it goes
so
    heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the
earth,
    seem
s to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy,
the
    air, look you, this brave o'erha
nging firmament, this
majestical
    roof fretted with golden fire- why, it appeareth no other
th
ing
    to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What
a
    piece of work is a ma
n! how noble in reason! how infinite in
    faculties! in form and moving how express and admirable
! in
    action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the
    beauty of the world, th
e paragon of animals! And yet to me
what
    is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me- no
, nor
woman
    neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.
  Ros. My lord, there was no 
such stuff in my thoughts.
  Ham. Why did you laugh then, when I said 'Man delights not me'?
  Ros
. To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten
    entertainment the players shall rec
eive from you. We coted
them
    on the way, and hither are they coming to offer you service.
  H
am. He that plays the king shall be welcome- his Majesty shall
    have tribute of me; the adventur
ous knight shall use his foil
and
    target; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humorous man
s
hall
    end his part in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose
    lungs are tickle o' th'
 sere; and the lady shall say her mind
    freely, or the blank verse shall halt for't. What player
s are
    they?
  Ros. Even those you were wont to take such delight in, the
    tragedians of th
e city.
  Ham. How chances it they travel? Their residence, both in
    reputation and profit, was
 better both ways.
  Ros. I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late
    innovation.

  Ham. Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in
the
    city? Are they so follow'd
?
  Ros. No indeed are they not.
  Ham. How comes it? Do they grow rusty?
  Ros. Nay, their endea
vour keeps in the wonted pace; but there
is,
    sir, an eyrie of children, little eyases, that cr
y out on the
top
    of question and are most tyrannically clapp'd for't. These
are now
    the 
fashion, and so berattle the common stages (so they call
    them) that many wearing rapiers are af
raid of goosequills and
    dare scarce come thither.
  Ham. What, are they children? Who maintain
s 'em? How are they
    escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can
    sing? Wi
ll they not say afterwards, if they should grow
    themselves to common players (as it is most lik
e, if their
means
    are no better), their writers do them wrong to make them
exclaim
    again
st their own succession.
  Ros. Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the
nation
  
  holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy. There was, for
a
    while, no money bid for argum
ent unless the poet and the
player
    went to cuffs in the question.
  Ham. Is't possible?
  Gu
il. O, there has been much throwing about of brains.
  Ham. Do the boys carry it away?
  Ros. Ay, 
that they do, my lord- Hercules and his load too.
  Ham. It is not very strange; for my uncle is Ki
ng of Denmark,
and
    those that would make mows at him while my father lived give
    twenty, f
orty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his picture
in
    little. 'Sblood, there is something in
 this more than
natural, if
    philosophy could find it out.

                     Flourish for
 the Players.

  Guil. There are the players.
  Ham. Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your
 hands, come!
Th'
    appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me
comply
    with yo
u in this garb, lest my extent to the players (which I
    tell you must show fairly outwards) shou
ld more appear like
    entertainment than yours. You are welcome. But my
uncle-father
    and au
nt-mother are deceiv'd.
  Guil. In what, my dear lord?
  Ham. I am but mad north-north-west. When 
the wind is southerly
I
    know a hawk from a handsaw.

                            Enter Polon
ius.

  Pol. Well be with you, gentlemen!
  Ham. Hark you, Guildenstern- and you too- at each ear
 a hearer!
    That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling
    clouts.
  Ros. H
appily he's the second time come to them; for they say an
old
    man is twice a child.
  Ham. I 
will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players. Mark
it.-
   You say right, sir; a Monday mornin
g; twas so indeed.
  Pol. My lord, I have news to tell you.
  Ham. My lord, I have news to tell yo
u. When Roscius was an
actor in
    Rome-
  Pol. The actors are come hither, my lord.
  Ham. Buz
z, buzz!
  Pol. Upon my honour-
  Ham. Then came each actor on his ass-
  Pol. The best actors in
 the world, either for tragedy, comedy,
    history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastora
l,
    tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral;
scene
    individable, or poem 
unlimited. Seneca cannot be too heavy,
nor
    Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the libe
rty, these
are
    the only men.
  Ham. O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!

  Pol. What treasure had he, my lord?
  Ham. Why,

         'One fair daughter, and no more,
  
         The which he loved passing well.'

  Pol. [aside] Still on my daughter.
  Ham. Am I not 
i' th' right, old Jephthah?
  Pol. If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I
    
love passing well.
  Ham. Nay, that follows not.
  Pol. What follows then, my lord?
  Ham. Why,


           'As by lot, God wot,'

 and then, you know,

           'It came to pass, as most l
ike it was.'

    The first row of the pious chanson will show you more; for
look
    where my a
bridgment comes.

                     Enter four or five Players.

    You are welcome, masters
; welcome, all.- I am glad to see
thee
    well.- Welcome, good friends.- O, my old friend? Why, t
hy
face is
    valanc'd since I saw thee last. Com'st' thou to' beard me in
    Denmark?- What, m
y young lady and mistress? By'r Lady, your
    ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you las
t by the
    altitude of a chopine. Pray God your voice, like a piece of
    uncurrent gold, be no
t crack'd within the ring.- Masters, you
are
    all welcome. We'll e'en to't like French falconer
s, fly at
    anything we see. We'll have a speech straight. Come, give us
a
    taste of your qu
ality. Come, a passionate speech.
  1. Play. What speech, my good lord?
  Ham. I heard thee speak 
me a speech once, but it was never
acted;
    or if it was, not above once; for the play, I rememb
er,
pleas'd
    not the million, 'twas caviary to the general; but it was (as
I
    receiv'd it,
 and others, whose judgments in such matters
cried in
    the top of mine) an excellent play, well
 digested in the
scenes,
    set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember one said
    th
ere were no sallets in the lines to make the matter
savoury,
    nor no matter in the phrase that 
might indict the author of
    affectation; but call'd it an honest method, as wholesome as
    sw
eet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech
in't
    I chiefly lov'd. 'Twas AEneas' 
tale to Dido, and thereabout
of it
    especially where he speaks of Priam's slaughter. If it live

in
    your memory, begin at this line- let me see, let me see:

         'The rugged Pyrrhus, 
like th' Hyrcanian beast-'

    'Tis not so; it begins with Pyrrhus:

         'The rugged Pyrrh
us, he whose sable arms,
         Black as his purpose, did the night resemble
         When he la
y couched in the ominous horse,
         Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd
        
 With heraldry more dismal. Head to foot
         Now is be total gules, horridly trick'd
        
 With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
         Bak'd and impasted with the parching str
eets,
         That lend a tyrannous and a damned light
         To their lord's murther. Roasted 
in wrath and fire,
         And thus o'ersized with coagulate gore,
         With eyes like carbun
cles, the hellish Pyrrhus
         Old grandsire Priam seeks.'

    So, proceed you.
  Pol. Fore
 God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good
     discretion.

  1. Play. 'Anon he finds
 him,
      Striking too short at Greeks. His antique sword,
      Rebellious to his arm, lies whe
re it falls,
      Repugnant to command. Unequal match'd,
      Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage s
trikes wide;
      But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
      Th' unnerved father falls. 
Then senseless Ilium,
      Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
      Stoops to his base, 
and with a hideous crash
      Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear. For lo! his sword,
      Which was dec
lining on the milky head
      Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' th' air to stick.
      So, as a paint
ed tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
      And, like a neutral to his will and matter,
      Did nothing.
  
    But, as we often see, against some storm,
      A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,

      The bold winds speechless, and the orb below
      As hush as death- anon the dreadful thun
der
      Doth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
      Aroused vengeance sets him new awo
rk;
      And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
      On Mars's armour, forg'd for proof eterne,

      With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
      Now falls on Priam.
      Out, out, t
hou strumpet Fortune! All you gods,
      In general synod take away her power;
      Break all th
e spokes and fellies from her wheel,
      And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
      
As low as to the fiends!

  Pol. This is too long.
  Ham. It shall to the barber's, with your bea
rd.- Prithee say
on.
    He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps. Say on;
come to
    H
ecuba.

  1. Play. 'But who, O who, had seen the mobled queen-'

  Ham. 'The mobled queen'?
  P
ol. That's good! 'Mobled queen' is good.

  1. Play. 'Run barefoot up and down, threat'ning the fl
ames
      With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head
      Where late the diadem stood, and for a 
robe,
      About her lank and all o'erteemed loins,
      A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught 
up-
      Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd
      'Gainst Fortune's state would trea
son have pronounc'd.
      But if the gods themselves did see her then,
      When she saw Pyrrhus
 make malicious sport
      In Mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,
      The instant burst
 of clamour that she made
      (Unless things mortal move them not at all)
      Would have made 
milch the burning eyes of heaven
      And passion in the gods.'

  Pol. Look, whe'r he has not t
urn'd his colour, and has tears
in's
    eyes. Prithee no more!
  Ham. 'Tis well. I'll have thee 
speak out the rest of this
soon.-
    Good my lord, will you see the players well bestow'd? Do you

    hear? Let them be well us'd; for they are the abstract and
brief
    chronicles of the time.
 After your death you were better have
a
    bad epitaph than their ill report while you live.
  
Pol. My lord, I will use them according to their desert.
  Ham. God's bodykins, man, much better! U
se every man after his
    desert, and who should scape whipping? Use them after your
own
    hon
our and dignity. The less they deserve, the more merit is
in
    your bounty. Take them in.
  Pol
. Come, sirs.
  Ham. Follow him, friends. We'll hear a play to-morrow.
                 Exeunt Pol
onius and Players [except the First].
    Dost thou hear me, old friend? Can you play 'The Murther 
of
    Gonzago'?
  1. Play. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need
, study a
    speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which I would set down
and
    insert in't, c
ould you not?
  1. Play. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Very well. Follow that lord- and look you mock him no
t.
                                            [Exit First Player.]
    My good friends, I'll leav
e you till night. You are welcome
to
    Elsinore.
  Ros. Good my lord!
  Ham. Ay, so, God b' wi
' ye!
                            [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
    Now I am alone.
    O 
what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
    Is it not monstrous that this player here,
    But in a f
iction, in a dream of passion,
    Could force his soul so to his own conceit
    That, from her w
orking, all his visage wann'd,
    Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
    A broken voice,
 and his whole function suiting
    With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!
    For Hecuba
!
    What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
    That he should weep for her? What would he do,
 
   Had he the motive and the cue for passion
    That I have? He would drown the stage with tears

    And cleave the general ear with horrid speech;
    Make mad the guilty and appal the free,
   
 Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed
    The very faculties of eyes and ears.
    Yet I,
    
A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak
    Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
    And can 
say nothing! No, not for a king,
    Upon whose property and most dear life
    A damn'd defeat wa
s made. Am I a coward?
    Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
    Plucks off my beard an
d blows it in my face?
    Tweaks me by th' nose? gives me the lie i' th' throat
    As deep as to
 the lungs? Who does me this, ha?
    'Swounds, I should take it! for it cannot be
    But I am pi
geon-liver'd and lack gall
    To make oppression bitter, or ere this
    I should have fatted all
 the region kites
    With this slave's offal. Bloody bawdy villain!
    Remorseless, treacherous,
 lecherous, kindless villain!
    O, vengeance!
    Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
  
  That I, the son of a dear father murther'd,
    Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
    M
ust (like a whore) unpack my heart with words
    And fall a-cursing like a very drab,
    A scull
ion!
    Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! Hum, I have heard
    That guilty creatures, sitting at
 a play,
    Have by the very cunning of the scene
    Been struck so to the soul that presently

    They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
    For murther, though it have no tongue, will speak

    With most miraculous organ, I'll have these Players
    Play something like the murther of my 
father
    Before mine uncle. I'll observe his looks;
    I'll tent him to the quick. If he but bl
ench,
    I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
    May be a devil; and the devil hath pow
er
    T' assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
    Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
   
 As he is very potent with such spirits,
    Abuses me to damn me. I'll have grounds
    More rela
tive than this. The play's the thing
    Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King.         Exi

ACT III. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King, Queen, Pol
onius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern,
and Lords.

  King. And can you by no drift of circums
tance
    Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
    Grating so harshly all his days of quiet

    With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
  Ros. He does confess he feels himself distracted,
   
 But from what cause he will by no means speak.
  Guil. Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,

    But with a crafty madness keeps aloof
    When we would bring him on to some confession
    Of
 his true state.
  Queen. Did he receive you well?
  Ros. Most like a gentleman.
  Guil. But with
 much forcing of his disposition.
  Ros. Niggard of question, but of our demands
    Most free in 
his reply.
  Queen. Did you assay him
    To any pastime?
  Ros. Madam, it so fell out that certa
in players
    We o'erraught on the way. Of these we told him,
    And there did seem in him a kin
d of joy
    To hear of it. They are here about the court,
    And, as I think, they have already 
order
    This night to play before him.
  Pol. 'Tis most true;
    And he beseech'd me to entrea
t your Majesties
    To hear and see the matter.
  King. With all my heart, and it doth much conte
nt me
    To hear him so inclin'd.
    Good gentlemen, give him a further edge
    And drive his 
purpose on to these delights.
  Ros. We shall, my lord.
                            Exeunt Rosencr
antz and Guildenstern.
  King. Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
    For we have closely sent for Haml
et hither,
    That he, as 'twere by accident, may here
    Affront Ophelia.
    Her father and m
yself (lawful espials)
    Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing unseen,
    We may of their encou
nter frankly judge
    And gather by him, as he is behav'd,
    If't be th' affliction of his love
, or no,
    That thus he suffers for.
  Queen. I shall obey you;
    And for your part, Ophelia,
 I do wish
    That your good beauties be the happy cause
    Of Hamlet's wildness. So shall I hop
e your virtues
    Will bring him to his wonted way again,
    To both your honours.
  Oph. Madam
, I wish it may.
                                                   [Exit Queen.]
  Pol. Ophelia, 
walk you here.- Gracious, so please you,
    We will bestow ourselves.- [To Ophelia] Read on this b
ook,
    That show of such an exercise may colour
    Your loneliness.- We are oft to blame in thi
s,
    'Tis too much prov'd, that with devotion's visage
    And pious action we do sugar o'er
  
  The Devil himself.
  King. [aside] O, 'tis too true!
    How smart a lash that speech doth give 
my conscience!
    The harlot's cheek, beautied with plast'ring art,
    Is not more ugly to the t
hing that helps it
    Than is my deed to my most painted word.
    O heavy burthen!
  Pol. I hea
r him coming. Let's withdraw, my lord.
                                      Exeunt King and Poloni
us].

                           Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. To be, or not to be- that is the question
:
    Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
    The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
 
   Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
    And by opposing end them. To die- to sleep-
    
No more; and by a sleep to say we end
    The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks
    That 
flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation
    Devoutly to be wish'd. To die- to sleep.
    To sleep- p
erchance to dream: ay, there's the rub!
    For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
    Wh
en we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
    Must give us pause. There's the respect
    That mak
es calamity of so long life.
    For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
    Th' oppresso
r's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
    The pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay,
    The ins
olence of office, and the spurns
    That patient merit of th' unworthy takes,
    When he himself
 might his quietus make
    With a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear,
    To grunt and swe
at under a weary life,
    But that the dread of something after death-
    The undiscover'd count
ry, from whose bourn
    No traveller returns- puzzles the will,
    And makes us rather bear thos
e ills we have
    Than fly to others that we know not of?
    Thus conscience does make cowards o
f us all,
    And thus the native hue of resolution
    Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of tho
ught,
    And enterprises of great pith and moment
    With this regard their currents turn awry

    And lose the name of action.- Soft you now!
    The fair Ophelia!- Nymph, in thy orisons
    B
e all my sins rememb'red.
  Oph. Good my lord,
    How does your honour for this many a day?
  Ha
m. I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
  Oph. My lord, I have remembrances of yours
    That I h
ave longed long to re-deliver.
    I pray you, now receive them.
  Ham. No, not I!
    I never ga
ve you aught.
  Oph. My honour'd lord, you know right well you did,
    And with them words of so 
sweet breath compos'd
    As made the things more rich. Their perfume lost,
    Take these again; 
for to the noble mind
    Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
    There, my lord.
  Ham
. Ha, ha! Are you honest?
  Oph. My lord?
  Ham. Are you fair?
  Oph. What means your lordship?

  Ham. That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit
no
    discourse to your beauty.

  Oph. Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with
honesty?
  Ham. Ay, truly; for the p
ower of beauty will sooner transform
    honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honest
y
can
    translate beauty into his likeness. This was sometime a
paradox,
    but now the time 
gives it proof. I did love you once.
  Oph. Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
  Ham. You sh
ould not have believ'd me; for virtue cannot so
    inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of 
it. I loved
you
    not.
  Oph. I was the more deceived.
  Ham. Get thee to a nunnery! Why would
st thou be a breeder of
    sinners? I am myself indifferent honest, but yet I could
accuse
    m
e of such things that it were better my mother had not borne
me.
    I am very proud, revengeful, 
ambitious; with more offences at
my
    beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to g
ive
    them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows
as I
    do, crawling betwee
n earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves
all;
    believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Wh
ere's your
    father?
  Oph. At home, my lord.
  Ham. Let the doors be shut upon him, that he ma
y play the fool
    nowhere but in's own house. Farewell.
  Oph. O, help him, you sweet heavens!

  Ham. If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy
dowry:
    be thou as chaste as ice,
 as pure as snow, thou shalt not
escape
    calumny. Get thee to a nunnery. Go, farewell. Or if th
ou wilt
    needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what
    monsters you make of
 them. To a nunnery, go; and quickly too.
    Farewell.
  Oph. O heavenly powers, restore him!
  
Ham. I have heard of your paintings too, well enough. God hath
    given you one face, and you make
 yourselves another. You jig,
you
    amble, and you lisp; you nickname God's creatures and make

your
    wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't! it hath
made
    me mad. I say, we 
will have no more marriages. Those that are
    married already- all but one- shall live; the rest 
shall keep
as
    they are. To a nunnery, go.                            Exit.
  Oph. O, what a n
oble mind is here o'erthrown!
    The courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword,
    Th
' expectancy and rose of the fair state,
    The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
    Th' o
bserv'd of all observers- quite, quite down!
    And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
    Th
at suck'd the honey of his music vows,
    Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
    Like 
sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
    That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
   
 Blasted with ecstasy. O, woe is me
    T' have seen what I have seen, see what I see!

         
          Enter King and Polonius.

  King. Love? his affections do not that way tend;
    Nor wh
at he spake, though it lack'd form a little,
    Was not like madness. There's something in his sou
l
    O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
    And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
    
Will be some danger; which for to prevent,
    I have in quick determination
    Thus set it down:
 he shall with speed to England
    For the demand of our neglected tribute.
    Haply the seas, a
nd countries different,
    With variable objects, shall expel
    This something-settled matter i
n his heart,
    Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
    From fashion of himself. What 
think you on't?
  Pol. It shall do well. But yet do I believe
    The origin and commencement of h
is grief
    Sprung from neglected love.- How now, Ophelia?
    You need not tell us what Lord Ham
let said.
    We heard it all.- My lord, do as you please;
    But if you hold it fit, after the p
lay
    Let his queen mother all alone entreat him
    To show his grief. Let her be round with hi
m;
    And I'll be plac'd so please you, in the ear
    Of all their conference. If she find him n
ot,
    To England send him; or confine him where
    Your wisdom best shall think.
  King. It sh
all be so.
    Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.         Exeunt.




Scene II.
Els
inore. hall in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet and three of the Players.

  Ham. Speak the speech, I p
ray you, as I pronounc'd it to you,
    trippingly on the tongue. But if you mouth it, as many of o
ur
    players do, I had as live the town crier spoke my lines. Nor
do
    not saw the air too mu
ch with your hand, thus, but use all
    gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and (as I may sa
y)
    whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and beget a
    temperance that may give it smo
othness. O, it offends me to
the
    soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion

to
    tatters, to very rags, to split the cars of the groundlings,
who
    (for the most part)
 are capable of nothing but inexplicable
dumb
    shows and noise. I would have such a fellow whip
p'd for
o'erdoing
    Termagant. It out-herods Herod. Pray you avoid it.
  Player. I warrant your
 honour.
  Ham. Be not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be
your
    tutor. Suit the 
action to the word, the word to the action;
with
    this special observance, that you o'erstep no
t the modesty of
    nature: for anything so overdone is from the purpose of
playing,
    whose e
nd, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as
    'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show
 Virtue her own
feature,
    scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time
his
    
form and pressure. Now this overdone, or come tardy off,
though
    it make the unskilful laugh, c
annot but make the judicious
    grieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance
    o
'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that
I
    have seen play, and heard other
s praise, and that highly (not
to
    speak it profanely), that, neither having the accent of
   
 Christians, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have
so
    strutted and bellowed that I h
ave thought some of Nature's
    journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they
imitated
 
   humanity so abominably.
  Player. I hope we have reform'd that indifferently with us,
sir.
  H
am. O, reform it altogether! And let those that play your
clowns
    speak no more than is set dow
n for them. For there be of them
    that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren

    spectators to laugh too, though in the mean time some
necessary
    question of the play be t
hen to be considered. That's
villanous
    and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses
 it.
Go
    make you ready.
                                                 Exeunt Players.

 
           Enter Polonius, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.

    How now, my lord? Will the King hea
r this piece of work?
  Pol. And the Queen too, and that presently.
  Ham. Bid the players make ha
ste, [Exit Polonius.] Will you two
    help to hasten them?
  Both. We will, my lord.             
          Exeunt they two.
  Ham. What, ho, Horatio!

                      Enter Horatio.

  H
or. Here, sweet lord, at your service.
  Ham. Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
    As e'er my 
conversation cop'd withal.
  Hor. O, my dear lord!
  Ham. Nay, do not think I flatter;
    For wh
at advancement may I hope from thee,
    That no revenue hast but thy good spirits
    To feed and
 clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
    No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
 
   And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
    Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?

    Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
    And could of men distinguish, her election
 
   Hath seal'd thee for herself. For thou hast been
    As one, in suff'ring all, that suffers noth
ing;
    A man that Fortune's buffets and rewards
    Hast ta'en with equal thanks; and blest are 
those
    Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled
    That they are not a pipe for Fortune
's finger
    To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
    That is not passion's slave, and
 I will wear him
    In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
    As I do thee. Something too
 much of this I
    There is a play to-night before the King.
    One scene of it comes near the c
ircumstance,
    Which I have told thee, of my father's death.
    I prithee, when thou seest that
 act afoot,
    Even with the very comment of thy soul
    Observe my uncle. If his occulted guilt

    Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
    It is a damned ghost that we have seen,
    And my
 imaginations are as foul
    As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
    For I mine eyes will 
rivet to his face,
    And after we will both our judgments join
    In censure of his seeming.
 
 Hor. Well, my lord.
    If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
    And scape detectin
g, I will pay the theft.

    Sound a flourish. [Enter Trumpets and Kettledrums. Danish
    march
. [Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz,
      Guildenstern, and other Lords attendant
, with the Guard
                       carrying torches.

  Ham. They are coming to the play. I 
must be idle.
    Get you a place.
  King. How fares our cousin Hamlet?
  Ham. Excellent, i' fait
h; of the chameleon's dish. I eat the
air,
    promise-cramm'd. You cannot feed capons so.
  King
. I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet. These words are
not
    mine.
  Ham. No, nor mine now.
 [To Polonius] My lord, you play'd once
    i' th' university, you say?
  Pol. That did I, my lord
, and was accounted a good actor.
  Ham. What did you enact?
  Pol. I did enact Julius Caesar; I w
as kill'd i' th' Capitol;
Brutus
    kill'd me.
  Ham. It was a brute part of him to kill so capi
tal a calf
there. Be
    the players ready.
  Ros. Ay, my lord. They stay upon your patience.
  
Queen. Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
  Ham. No, good mother. Here's metal more attractive
.
  Pol. [to the King] O, ho! do you mark that?
  Ham. Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
           
                       [Sits down at Ophelia's feet.]

  Oph. No, my lord.
  Ham. I mean, my head
 upon your lap?
  Oph. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Do you think I meant country matters?
  Oph. I think n
othing, my lord.
  Ham. That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
  Oph. What is, my lord?

  Ham. Nothing.
  Oph. You are merry, my lord.
  Ham. Who, I?
  Oph. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. O God
, your only jig-maker! What should a man do but be
merry?
    For look you how cheerfully my mothe
r looks, and my father
died
    within 's two hours.
  Oph. Nay 'tis twice two months, my lord.

  Ham. So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I'll have
a
    suit of sables. O heavens!
 die two months ago, and not
forgotten
    yet? Then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive
 his
life
    half a year. But, by'r Lady, he must build churches then; or
else
    shall he suf
fer not thinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose

    epitaph is 'For O, for O, the hobby-horse is
 forgot!'

               Hautboys play. The dumb show enters.

    Enter a King and a Queen ver
y lovingly; the Queen embracing
    him and he her. She kneels, and makes show of protestation
   
 unto him. He takes her up, and declines his head upon her
    neck. He lays him down upon a bank o
f flowers. She, seeing
    him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his
    crown
, kisses it, pours poison in the sleeper's ears, and
    leaves him. The Queen returns, finds the K
ing dead, and makes
    passionate action. The Poisoner with some three or four
Mutes,
    comes 
in again, seem to condole with her. The dead body is
    carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen
 with gifts; she
    seems harsh and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts
    his love.
     
                                                    Exeunt.

  Oph. What means this, my lord?
  H
am. Marry, this is miching malhecho; it means mischief.
  Oph. Belike this show imports the argumen
t of the play.

                      Enter Prologue.

  Ham. We shall know by this fellow. The 
players cannot keep
counsel;
    they'll tell all.
  Oph. Will he tell us what this show meant?

  Ham. Ay, or any show that you'll show him. Be not you asham'd
to
    show, he'll not shame to te
ll you what it means.
  Oph. You are naught, you are naught! I'll mark the play.

    Pro. For us
, and for our tragedy,
      Here stooping to your clemency,
      We beg your hearing patiently. 
                    [Exit.]

  Ham. Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
  Oph. 'Tis brief,
 my lord.
  Ham. As woman's love.

              Enter [two Players as] King and Queen.

    Ki
ng. Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round
      Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed gro
und,
      And thirty dozen moons with borrowed sheen
      About the world have times twelve thir
ties been,
      Since love our hearts, and Hymen did our hands,
      Unite comutual in most sacr
ed bands.
    Queen. So many journeys may the sun and moon
      Make us again count o'er ere love
 be done!
      But woe is me! you are so sick of late,
      So far from cheer and from your form
er state.
      That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
      Discomfort you, my lord, it not
hing must;
      For women's fear and love holds quantity,
      In neither aught, or in extremity
.
      Now what my love is, proof hath made you know;
      And as my love is siz'd, my fear is s
o.
      Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
      Where little fears grow great, g
reat love grows there.
    King. Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;
      My operant
 powers their functions leave to do.
      And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
      Ho
nour'd, belov'd, and haply one as kind
      For husband shalt thou-
    Queen. O, confound the re
st!
      Such love must needs be treason in my breast.
      When second husband let me be accurs
t!
      None wed the second but who killed the first.

  Ham. [aside] Wormwood, wormwood!

   
 Queen. The instances that second marriage move
      Are base respects of thrift, but none of love
.
      A second time I kill my husband dead
      When second husband kisses me in bed.
    King
. I do believe you think what now you speak;
      But what we do determine oft we break.
      Pu
rpose is but the slave to memory,
      Of violent birth, but poor validity;
      Which now, like
 fruit unripe, sticks on the tree,
      But fall unshaken when they mellow be.
      Most necessa
ry 'tis that we forget
      To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt.
      What to ourselves i
n passion we propose,
      The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
      The violence of eithe
r grief or joy
      Their own enactures with themselves destroy.
      Where joy most revels, gri
ef doth most lament;
      Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
      This world is not f
or aye, nor 'tis not strange
      That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
      For 
'tis a question left us yet to prove,
      Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
     
 The great man down, you mark his favourite flies,
      The poor advanc'd makes friends of enemies
;
      And hitherto doth love on fortune tend,
      For who not needs shall never lack a friend,

      And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
      Directly seasons him his enemy.
      But,
 orderly to end where I begun,
      Our wills and fates do so contrary run
      That our devices
 still are overthrown;
      Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own.
      So think tho
u wilt no second husband wed;
      But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
    Queen. N
or earth to me give food, nor heaven light,
      Sport and repose lock from me day and night,
   
   To desperation turn my trust and hope,
      An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope,
      Eac
h opposite that blanks the face of joy
      Meet what I would have well, and it destroy,
      Bo
th here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
      If, once a widow, ever I be wife!

  Ham. If sh
e should break it now!

    King. 'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile.
      My spirit
s grow dull, and fain I would beguile
      The tedious day with sleep.
    Queen. Sleep rock thy 
brain,
                                                    [He] sleeps.
      And never come misch
ance between us twain!
Exit.

  Ham. Madam, how like you this play?
  Queen. The lady doth prote
st too much, methinks.
  Ham. O, but she'll keep her word.
  King. Have you heard the argument? Is
 there no offence in't?
  Ham. No, no! They do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i'
th'
    wo
rld.
  King. What do you call the play?
  Ham. 'The Mousetrap.' Marry, how? Tropically. This play 
is the
    image of a murther done in Vienna. Gonzago is the duke's
name;
    his wife, Baptista.
 You shall see anon. 'Tis a knavish piece
of
    work; but what o' that? Your Majesty, and we that
 have free
    souls, it touches us not. Let the gall'd jade winch; our
withers
    are unwrung.


                         Enter Lucianus.

    This is one Lucianus, nephew to the King.
  Oph.
 You are as good as a chorus, my lord.
  Ham. I could interpret between you and your love, if I cou
ld
see
    the puppets dallying.
  Oph. You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
  Ham. It would cos
t you a groaning to take off my edge.
  Oph. Still better, and worse.
  Ham. So you must take your
 husbands.- Begin, murtherer. Pox,
leave
    thy damnable faces, and begin! Come, the croaking rav
en doth
    bellow for revenge.

    Luc. Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing
;
      Confederate season, else no creature seeing;
      Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds co
llected,
      With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,
      Thy natural magic and dire
 property
      On wholesome life usurp immediately.
                                   Pours the 
poison in his ears.

  Ham. He poisons him i' th' garden for's estate. His name's
Gonzago.
    T
he story is extant, and written in very choice Italian. You
    shall see anon how the murtherer ge
ts the love of Gonzago's
wife.
  Oph. The King rises.
  Ham. What, frighted with false fire?
  Q
ueen. How fares my lord?
  Pol. Give o'er the play.
  King. Give me some light! Away!
  All. Ligh
ts, lights, lights!
                              Exeunt all but Hamlet and Horatio.
  Ham.   Why,
 let the strucken deer go weep,
          The hart ungalled play;
         For some must watch, wh
ile some must sleep:
          Thus runs the world away.
    Would not this, sir, and a forest of 
feathers- if the rest of
my
    fortunes turn Turk with me-with two Provincial roses on my
raz'd

    shoes, get me a fellowship in a cry of players, sir?
  Hor. Half a share.
  Ham.   A whole on
e I!
         For thou dost know, O Damon dear,
           This realm dismantled was
         Of 
Jove himself; and now reigns here
           A very, very- pajock.
  Hor. You might have rhym'd.

  Ham. O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand
    pound! Didst perceive?
  Hor.
 Very well, my lord.
  Ham. Upon the talk of the poisoning?
  Hor. I did very well note him.
  Ha
m.   Aha! Come, some music! Come, the recorders!
         For if the King like not the comedy,
   
      Why then, belike he likes it not, perdy.
    Come, some music!

                Enter Rosen
crantz and Guildenstern.

  Guil. Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.
  Ham. Sir, a whole
 history.
  Guil. The King, sir-
  Ham. Ay, sir, what of him?
  Guil. Is in his retirement, marve
llous distemper'd.
  Ham. With drink, sir?
  Guil. No, my lord; rather with choler.
  Ham. Your w
isdom should show itself more richer to signify this
to
    the doctor; for me to put him to his p
urgation would perhaps
    plunge him into far more choler.
  Guil. Good my lord, put your discour
se into some frame, and
start
    not so wildly from my affair.
  Ham. I am tame, sir; pronounce.

  Guil. The Queen, your mother, in most great affliction of
spirit
    hath sent me to you.
  H
am. You are welcome.
  Guil. Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right
breed.
    If i
t shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, I will
do
    your mother's commandment; if not,
 your pardon and my return
    shall be the end of my business.
  Ham. Sir, I cannot.
  Guil. Wha
t, my lord?
  Ham. Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseas'd. But, sir,
such
    answer as I
 can make, you shall command; or rather, as you
say,
    my mother. Therefore no more, but to the 
matter! My mother,
you
    say-
  Ros. Then thus she says: your behaviour hath struck her into
 
   amazement and admiration.
  Ham. O wonderful son, that can so stonish a mother! But is
there no

    sequel at the heels of this mother's admiration? Impart.
  Ros. She desires to speak with you
 in her closet ere you go to
bed.
  Ham. We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you an
y
    further trade with us?
  Ros. My lord, you once did love me.
  Ham. And do still, by these 
pickers and stealers!
  Ros. Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? You do
surely
    bar
 the door upon your own liberty, if you deny your griefs
to
    your friend.
  Ham. Sir, I lack a
dvancement.
  Ros. How can that be, when you have the voice of the King
himself
    for your succ
ession in Denmark?
  Ham. Ay, sir, but 'while the grass grows'- the proverb is
something
    must
y.

                     Enter the Players with recorders.

    O, the recorders! Let me see one
. To withdraw with you- why
do
    you go about to recover the wind of me, as if you would drive

me
    into a toil?
  Guil. O my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too
unmannerly.
  Ham.
 I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this
pipe?
  Guil. My lord, I cannot.
  Ham. I
 pray you.
  Guil. Believe me, I cannot.
  Ham. I do beseech you.
  Guil. I know, no touch of it,
 my lord.
  Ham. It is as easy as lying. Govern these ventages with your
    fingers and thumbs, g
ive it breath with your mouth, and it
will
    discourse most eloquent music. Look you, these are 
the stops.
  Guil. But these cannot I command to any utt'rance of harmony. I
    have not the skil
l.
  Ham. Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me!
You
    would play upon me; you
 would seem to know my stops; you
would
    pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound me 
from my
    lowest note to the top of my compass; and there is much
music,
    excellent voice, i
n this little organ, yet cannot you make it
    speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am easier to be play
'd on than
a
    pipe? Call me what instrument you will, though you can fret
me,
    you cannot 
play upon me.

                        Enter Polonius.

    God bless you, sir!
  Pol. My lord,
 the Queen would speak with you, and presently.
  Ham. Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in sha
pe of a camel?
  Pol. By th' mass, and 'tis like a camel indeed.
  Ham. Methinks it is like a weas
el.
  Pol. It is back'd like a weasel.
  Ham. Or like a whale.
  Pol. Very like a whale.
  Ham. 
Then will I come to my mother by-and-by.- They fool me to
the
    top of my bent.- I will come by-
and-by.
  Pol. I will say so.                                      Exit.
  Ham. 'By-and-by' is eas
ily said.- Leave me, friends.
                                        [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]

 
   'Tis now the very witching time of night,
    When churchyards yawn, and hell itself breathes ou
t
    Contagion to this world. Now could I drink hot blood
    And do such bitter business as the 
day
    Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother!
    O heart, lose not thy nature; let not 
ever
    The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom.
    Let me be cruel, not unnatural;
    I will s
peak daggers to her, but use none.
    My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites-
    How in my wor
ds somever she be shent,
    To give them seals never, my soul, consent!             Exit.





Scene III.
A room in the Castle.

Enter King, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.

  King. I like h
im not, nor stands it safe with us
    To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;
    I your
 commission will forthwith dispatch,
    And he to England shall along with you.
    The terms of 
our estate may not endure
    Hazard so near us as doth hourly grow
    Out of his lunacies.
  Gu
il. We will ourselves provide.
    Most holy and religious fear it is
    To keep those many many 
bodies safe
    That live and feed upon your Majesty.
  Ros. The single and peculiar life is bound

    With all the strength and armour of the mind
    To keep itself from noyance; but much more

    That spirit upon whose weal depends and rests
    The lives of many. The cesse of majesty
    
Dies not alone, but like a gulf doth draw
    What's near it with it. It is a massy wheel,
    Fix
'd on the summit of the highest mount,
    To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
    Are
 mortis'd and adjoin'd; which when it falls,
    Each small annexment, petty consequence,
    Atte
nds the boist'rous ruin. Never alone
    Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.
  King. Arm 
you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;
    For we will fetters put upon this fear,
    Which now 
goes too free-footed.
  Both. We will haste us.
                                               Exe
unt Gentlemen.

                   Enter Polonius.

  Pol. My lord, he's going to his mother's c
loset.
    Behind the arras I'll convey myself
    To hear the process. I'll warrant she'll tax hi
m home;
    And, as you said, and wisely was it said,
    'Tis meet that some more audience than a
 mother,
    Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear
    The speech, of vantage. Fare you
 well, my liege.
    I'll call upon you ere you go to bed
    And tell you what I know.
  King. T
hanks, dear my lord.
                                                Exit [Polonius].
    O, my of
fence is rank, it smells to heaven;
    It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,
    A brother's mu
rther! Pray can I not,
    Though inclination be as sharp as will.
    My stronger guilt defeats m
y strong intent,
    And, like a man to double business bound,
    I stand in pause where I shall 
first begin,
    And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
    Were thicker than itself with brot
her's blood,
    Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
    To wash it white as snow? Where
to serves mercy
    But to confront the visage of offence?
    And what's in prayer but this twofo
ld force,
    To be forestalled ere we come to fall,
    Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up
;
    My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer
    Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul mur
ther'?
    That cannot be; since I am still possess'd
    Of those effects for which I did the mur
ther-
    My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.
    May one be pardon'd and retain th' offenc
e?
    In the corrupted currents of this world
    Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,
  
  And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
    Buys out the law; but 'tis not so above.
    There
 is no shuffling; there the action lies
    In his true nature, and we ourselves compell'd,
    Ev
en to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
    To give in evidence. What then? What rests?
    Tr
y what repentance can. What can it not?
    Yet what can it when one cannot repent?
    O wretched
 state! O bosom black as death!
    O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
    Art more engag'
d! Help, angels! Make assay.
    Bow, stubborn knees; and heart with strings of steel,
    Be soft
 as sinews of the new-born babe!
    All may be well.                                  He kneels.


                         Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
    An
d now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven,
    And so am I reveng'd. That would be scann'd.
    A 
villain kills my father; and for that,
    I, his sole son, do this same villain send
    To heave
n.
    Why, this is hire and salary, not revenge!
    He took my father grossly, full of bread,
 
   With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
    And how his audit stands, who knows save h
eaven?
    But in our circumstance and course of thought,
    'Tis heavy with him; and am I then r
eveng'd,
    To take him in the purging of his soul,
    When he is fit and seasoned for his passa
ge?
    No.
    Up, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent.
    When he is drunk asleep; or in h
is rage;
    Or in th' incestuous pleasure of his bed;
    At gaming, swearing, or about some act

    That has no relish of salvation in't-
    Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,
 
   And that his soul may be as damn'd and black
    As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays.
   
 This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.              Exit.
  King. [rises] My words fly up, my t
houghts remain below.
    Words without thoughts never to heaven go.             Exit.




Sce
ne IV.
The Queen's closet.

Enter Queen and Polonius.

  Pol. He will come straight. Look you l
ay home to him.
    Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,
    And that your Grace 
hath screen'd and stood between
    Much heat and him. I'll silence me even here.
    Pray you be 
round with him.
  Ham. (within) Mother, mother, mother!
  Queen. I'll warrant you; fear me not. Wi
thdraw; I hear him
coming.
                              [Polonius hides behind the arras.]

   
                       Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Now, mother, what's the matter?
  Queen. Hamlet, tho
u hast thy father much offended.
  Ham. Mother, you have my father much offended.
  Queen. Come, c
ome, you answer with an idle tongue.
  Ham. Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
  Queen. Wh
y, how now, Hamlet?
  Ham. What's the matter now?
  Queen. Have you forgot me?
  Ham. No, by the 
rood, not so!
    You are the Queen, your husband's brother's wife,
    And (would it were not so!
) you are my mother.
  Queen. Nay, then I'll set those to you that can speak.
  Ham. Come, come, a
nd sit you down. You shall not budge;
    You go not till I set you up a glass
    Where you may s
ee the inmost part of you.
  Queen. What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murther me?
    Help, help, h
o!
  Pol. [behind] What, ho! help, help, help!
  Ham. [draws] How now? a rat? Dead for a ducat, de
ad!
            [Makes a pass through the arras and] kills Polonius.
  Pol. [behind] O, I am slain
!
  Queen. O me, what hast thou done?
  Ham. Nay, I know not. Is it the King?
  Queen. O, what a 
rash and bloody deed is this!
  Ham. A bloody deed- almost as bad, good mother,
    As kill a king
, and marry with his brother.
  Queen. As kill a king?
  Ham. Ay, lady, it was my word.
         
                [Lifts up the arras and sees Polonius.]
    Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, fa
rewell!
    I took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune.
    Thou find'st to be too busy is some 
danger.
    Leave wringing of your hands. Peace! sit you down
    And let me wring your heart; for
 so I shall
    If it be made of penetrable stuff;
    If damned custom have not braz'd it so
   
 That it is proof and bulwark against sense.
  Queen. What have I done that thou dar'st wag thy ton
gue
    In noise so rude against me?
  Ham. Such an act
    That blurs the grace and blush of mod
esty;
    Calls virtue hypocrite; takes off the rose
    From the fair forehead of an innocent lov
e,
    And sets a blister there; makes marriage vows
    As false as dicers' oaths. O, such a deed

    As from the body of contraction plucks
    The very soul, and sweet religion makes
    A rha
psody of words! Heaven's face doth glow;
    Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
    With tristf
ul visage, as against the doom,
    Is thought-sick at the act.
  Queen. Ah me, what act,
    Tha
t roars so loud and thunders in the index?
  Ham. Look here upon th's picture, and on this,
    Th
e counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
    See what a grace was seated on this brow;
    Hyper
ion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
    An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
    A stati
on like the herald Mercury
    New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill:
    A combination and a form 
indeed
    Where every god did seem to set his seal
    To give the world assurance of a man.
   
 This was your husband. Look you now what follows.
    Here is your husband, like a mildew'd ear
 
   Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
    Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed
,
    And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes
    You cannot call it love; for at your age
   
 The heyday in the blood is tame, it's humble,
    And waits upon the judgment; and what judgment

    Would step from this to this? Sense sure you have,
    Else could you not have motion; but sure
 that sense
    Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,
    Nor sense to ecstacy was ne'er so thr
all'd
    But it reserv'd some quantity of choice
    To serve in such a difference. What devil wa
s't
    That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
    Eyes without feeling, feeling without sig
ht,
    Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
    Or but a sickly part of one true sense

    Could not so mope.
    O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
    If thou canst mutine
 in a matron's bones,
    To flaming youth let virtue be as wax
    And melt in her own fire. Proc
laim no shame
    When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
    Since frost itself as actively 
doth burn,
    And reason panders will.
  Queen. O Hamlet, speak no more!
    Thou turn'st mine e
yes into my very soul,
    And there I see such black and grained spots
    As will not leave thei
r tinct.
  Ham. Nay, but to live
    In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
    Stew'd in corrupti
on, honeying and making love
    Over the nasty sty!
  Queen. O, speak to me no more!
    These w
ords like daggers enter in mine ears.
    No more, sweet Hamlet!
  Ham. A murtherer and a villain!

    A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
    Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
  
  A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
    That from a shelf the precious diadem stole
    And p
ut it in his pocket!
  Queen. No more!

                Enter the Ghost in his nightgown.

  Ha
m. A king of shreds and patches!-
    Save me and hover o'er me with your wings,
    You heavenly 
guards! What would your gracious figure?
  Queen. Alas, he's mad!
  Ham. Do you not come your tard
y son to chide,
    That, laps'd in time and passion, lets go by
    Th' important acting of your 
dread command?
    O, say!
  Ghost. Do not forget. This visitation
    Is but to whet thy almost 
blunted purpose.
    But look, amazement on thy mother sits.
    O, step between her and her fight
ing soul
    Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works.
    Speak to her, Hamlet.
  Ham. How is i
t with you, lady?
  Queen. Alas, how is't with you,
    That you do bend your eye on vacancy,
   
 And with th' encorporal air do hold discourse?
    Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
 
   And, as the sleeping soldiers in th' alarm,
    Your bedded hairs, like life in excrements,
   
 Start up and stand an end. O gentle son,
    Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
    Sprinkl
e cool patience! Whereon do you look?
  Ham. On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!
    His 
form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
    Would make them capable.- Do not look upon me,

    Lest with this piteous action you convert
    My stern effects. Then what I have to do
    Wil
l want true colour- tears perchance for blood.
  Queen. To whom do you speak this?
  Ham. Do you s
ee nothing there?
  Queen. Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
  Ham. Nor did you nothing hear?

  Queen. No, nothing but ourselves.
  Ham. Why, look you there! Look how it steals away!
    My 
father, in his habit as he liv'd!
    Look where he goes even now out at the portal!
             
                                        Exit Ghost.
  Queen. This is the very coinage of your brain
.
    This bodiless creation ecstasy
    Is very cunning in.
  Ham. Ecstasy?
    My pulse as you
rs doth temperately keep time
    And makes as healthful music. It is not madness
    That I have 
utt'red. Bring me to the test,
    And I the matter will reword; which madness
    Would gambol fr
om. Mother, for love of grace,
    Lay not that flattering unction to your soul
    That not your 
trespass but my madness speaks.
    It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
    Whiles rank 
corruption, mining all within,
    Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
    Repent what's p
ast; avoid what is to come;
    And do not spread the compost on the weeds
    To make them ranker
. Forgive me this my virtue;
    For in the fatness of these pursy times
    Virtue itself of vice
 must pardon beg-
    Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.
  Queen. O Hamlet, thou hast cle
ft my heart in twain.
  Ham. O, throw away the worser part of it,
    And live the purer with the 
other half,
    Good night- but go not to my uncle's bed.
    Assume a virtue, if you have it not.

    That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat
    Of habits evil, is angel yet in this,
    T
hat to the use of actions fair and good
    He likewise gives a frock or livery,
    That aptly is
 put on. Refrain to-night,
    And that shall lend a kind of easiness
    To the next abstinence; 
the next more easy;
    For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
    And either [master] the
 devil, or throw him out
    With wondrous potency. Once more, good night;
    And when you are de
sirous to be blest,
    I'll blessing beg of you.- For this same lord,
    I do repent; but heaven
 hath pleas'd it so,
    To punish me with this, and this with me,
    That I must be their scourg
e and minister.
    I will bestow him, and will answer well
    The death I gave him. So again, go
od night.
    I must be cruel, only to be kind;
    Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.
  
  One word more, good lady.
  Queen. What shall I do?
  Ham. Not this, by no means, that I bid you
 do:
    Let the bloat King tempt you again to bed;
    Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his m
ouse;
    And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
    Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd f
ingers,
    Make you to ravel all this matter out,
    That I essentially am not in madness,
    
But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;
    For who that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,

    Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib
    Such dear concernings hide? Who would do so?
    
No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
    Unpeg the basket on the house's top,
    Let the birds fl
y, and like the famous ape,
    To try conclusions, in the basket creep
    And break your own nec
k down.
  Queen. Be thou assur'd, if words be made of breath,
    And breath of life, I have no li
fe to breathe
    What thou hast said to me.
  Ham. I must to England; you know that?
  Queen. Al
ack,
    I had forgot! 'Tis so concluded on.
  Ham. There's letters seal'd; and my two schoolfello
ws,
    Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,
    They bear the mandate; they must sweep my w
ay
    And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
    For 'tis the sport to have the enginer
    Hoi
st with his own petar; and 't shall go hard
    But I will delve one yard below their mines
    An
d blow them at the moon. O, 'tis most sweet
    When in one line two crafts directly meet.
    Thi
s man shall set me packing.
    I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.-
    Mother, good night
.- Indeed, this counsellor
    Is now most still, most secret, and most grave,
    Who was in life
 a foolish peating knave.
    Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.
    Good night, mother.

                  [Exit the Queen. Then] Exit Hamlet, tugging in
                                  
                     Polonius.

ACT IV. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle
.

Enter King and Queen, with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  King. There's matter in these sig
hs. These profound heaves
    You must translate; 'tis fit we understand them.
    Where is your s
on?
  Queen. Bestow this place on us a little while.
                          [Exeunt Rosencrantz
 and Guildenstern.]
    Ah, mine own lord, what have I seen to-night!
  King. What, Gertrude? How 
does Hamlet?
  Queen. Mad as the sea and wind when both contend
    Which is the mightier. In his 
lawless fit
    Behind the arras hearing something stir,
    Whips out his rapier, cries 'A rat, a
 rat!'
    And in this brainish apprehension kills
    The unseen good old man.
  King. O heavy d
eed!
    It had been so with us, had we been there.
    His liberty is full of threats to all-
  
  To you yourself, to us, to every one.
    Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
    It w
ill be laid to us, whose providence
    Should have kept short, restrain'd, and out of haunt
    T
his mad young man. But so much was our love
    We would not understand what was most fit,
    But
, like the owner of a foul disease,
    To keep it from divulging, let it feed
    Even on the pit
h of life. Where is he gone?
  Queen. To draw apart the body he hath kill'd;
    O'er whom his ver
y madness, like some ore
    Among a mineral of metals base,
    Shows itself pure. He weeps for w
hat is done.
  King. O Gertrude, come away!
    The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch
    B
ut we will ship him hence; and this vile deed
    We must with all our majesty and skill
    Both 
countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!

             Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

   
 Friends both, go join you with some further aid.
    Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
    A
nd from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him.
    Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the bod
y
    Into the chapel. I pray you haste in this.
                          Exeunt [Rosencrantz and
 Guildenstern].
    Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends
    And let them know both wh
at we mean to do
    And what's untimely done. [So haply slander-]
    Whose whisper o'er the worl
d's diameter,
    As level as the cannon to his blank,
    Transports his poisoned shot- may miss 
our name
    And hit the woundless air.- O, come away!
    My soul is full of discord and dismay.

                                                         Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A pa
ssage in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Safely stow'd.
  Gentlemen. (within) Hamlet! Lord H
amlet!
  Ham. But soft! What noise? Who calls on Hamlet? O, here they
come.

               Ente
r Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Ros. What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
  Ham. C
ompounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
  Ros. Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
  
  And bear it to the chapel.
  Ham. Do not believe it.
  Ros. Believe what?
  Ham. That I can kee
p your counsel, and not mine own. Besides,
to be
    demanded of a sponge, what replication should
 be made by the
son
    of a king?
  Ros. Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
  Ham. Ay, sir; tha
t soaks up the King's countenance, his
rewards,
    his authorities. But such officers do the King
 best service
in
    the end. He keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his
jaw;
    first mo
uth'd, to be last swallowed. When he needs what you
have
    glean'd, it is but squeezing you and,
 sponge, you shall be
dry
    again.
  Ros. I understand you not, my lord.
  Ham. I am glad of i
t. A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.
  Ros. My lord, you must tell us where the body is and
 go with us
to
    the King.
  Ham. The body is with the King, but the King is not with the
body
.
    The King is a thing-
  Guil. A thing, my lord?
  Ham. Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox
, and all after.
                                                         Exeunt.




Scene II
I.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King.

  King. I have sent to seek him and to find th
e body.
    How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
    Yet must not we put the strong law o
n him.
    He's lov'd of the distracted multitude,
    Who like not in their judgment, but their e
yes;
    And where 'tis so, th' offender's scourge is weigh'd,
    But never the offence. To bear 
all smooth and even,
    This sudden sending him away must seem
    Deliberate pause. Diseases des
perate grown
    By desperate appliance are reliev'd,
    Or not at all.

                    En
ter Rosencrantz.

    How now O What hath befall'n?
  Ros. Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lo
rd,
    We cannot get from him.
  King. But where is he?
  Ros. Without, my lord; guarded, to kno
w your pleasure.
  King. Bring him before us.
  Ros. Ho, Guildenstern! Bring in my lord.

      
  Enter Hamlet and Guildenstern [with Attendants].

  King. Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
  Ham.
 At supper.
  King. At supper? Where?
  Ham. Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A certain

    convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your worm is
your
    only emperor for diet. We 
fat all creatures else to fat us,
and
    we fat ourselves for maggots. Your fat king and your lea
n
beggar
    is but variable service- two dishes, but to one table. That's
the
    end.
  King.
 Alas, alas!
  Ham. A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and
eat
    of the fish
 that hath fed of that worm.
  King. What dost thou mean by this?
  Ham. Nothing but to show you h
ow a king may go a progress
through
    the guts of a beggar.
  King. Where is Polonius?
  Ham. 
In heaven. Send thither to see. If your messenger find him
not
    there, seek him i' th' other pl
ace yourself. But indeed, if
you
    find him not within this month, you shall nose him as you go

up
    the stair, into the lobby.
  King. Go seek him there. [To Attendants.]
  Ham. He will sta
y till you come.
                                            [Exeunt Attendants.]
  King. Hamlet, 
this deed, for thine especial safety,-
    Which we do tender as we dearly grieve
    For that whi
ch thou hast done,- must send thee hence
    With fiery quickness. Therefore prepare thyself.
    
The bark is ready and the wind at help,
    Th' associates tend, and everything is bent
    For En
gland.
  Ham. For England?
  King. Ay, Hamlet.
  Ham. Good.
  King. So is it, if thou knew'st ou
r purposes.
  Ham. I see a cherub that sees them. But come, for England!
    Farewell, dear mother
.
  King. Thy loving father, Hamlet.
  Ham. My mother! Father and mother is man and wife; man and 
wife
is
    one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England!
Exit.
  King. Follow him at foot; t
empt him with speed aboard.
    Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night.
    Away! for everythi
ng is seal'd and done
    That else leans on th' affair. Pray you make haste.
                    
        Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]
    And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught,-

    As my great power thereof may give thee sense,
    Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
 
   After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
    Pays homage to us,- thou mayst not coldly set
    
Our sovereign process, which imports at full,
    By letters congruing to that effect,
    The pre
sent death of Hamlet. Do it, England;
    For like the hectic in my blood he rages,
    And thou m
ust cure me. Till I know 'tis done,
    Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.             Exit
.

Scene IV.
Near Elsinore.

Enter Fortinbras with his Army over the stage.


  For. Go, Captain, from me greet the Danish king.
    Tell him that by his license Fortinbras
 
   Craves the conveyance of a promis'd march
    Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.
    If
 that his Majesty would aught with us,
    We shall express our duty in his eye;
    And let him k
now so.
  Capt. I will do't, my lord.
  For. Go softly on.
                                   Exe
unt [all but the Captain].

       Enter Hamlet, Rosencrantz, [Guildenstern,] and others.

  Ham
. Good sir, whose powers are these?
  Capt. They are of Norway, sir.
  Ham. How purpos'd, sir, I p
ray you?
  Capt. Against some part of Poland.
  Ham. Who commands them, sir?
  Capt. The nephew t
o old Norway, Fortinbras.
  Ham. Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
    Or for some frontier
?
  Capt. Truly to speak, and with no addition,
    We go to gain a little patch of ground
    Th
at hath in it no profit but the name.
    To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
    Nor w
ill it yield to Norway or the Pole
    A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
  Ham. Why, then t
he Polack never will defend it.
  Capt. Yes, it is already garrison'd.
  Ham. Two thousand souls a
nd twenty thousand ducats
    Will not debate the question of this straw.
    This is th' imposthu
me of much wealth and peace,
    That inward breaks, and shows no cause without
    Why the man di
es.- I humbly thank you, sir.
  Capt. God b' wi' you, sir.                             [Exit.]
  R
os. Will't please you go, my lord?
  Ham. I'll be with you straight. Go a little before.
         
                               [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]
    How all occasions do inform against me

    And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
    If his chief good and market of his time
    Be 
but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.
    Sure he that made us with such large discourse,
    L
ooking before and after, gave us not
    That capability and godlike reason
    To fust in us unus
'd. Now, whether it be
    Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple
    Of thinking too precisely 
on th' event,-
    A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
    And ever three parts c
oward,- I do not know
    Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do,'
    Sith I have cause, and w
ill, and strength, and means
    To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me.
    Witness this army
 of such mass and charge,
    Led by a delicate and tender prince,
    Whose spirit, with divine a
mbition puff'd,
    Makes mouths at the invisible event,
    Exposing what is mortal and unsure
 
   To all that fortune, death, and danger dare,
    Even for an eggshell. Rightly to be great
    
Is not to stir without great argument,
    But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
    When honour'
s at the stake. How stand I then,
    That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,
    Excitements
 of my reason and my blood,
    And let all sleep, while to my shame I see
    The imminent death 
of twenty thousand men
    That for a fantasy and trick of fame
    Go to their graves like beds, 
fight for a plot
    Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
    Which is not tomb enough and co
ntinent
    To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,
    My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing w
orth!            Exit.

Scene V.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter Horat
io, Queen, and a Gentleman.

  Queen. I will not speak with her.
  Gent. She is importunate, inde
ed distract.
    Her mood will needs be pitied.
  Queen. What would she have?
  Gent. She speaks 
much of her father; says she hears
    There's tricks i' th' world, and hems, and beats her heart;

    Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,
    That carry but half sense. Her speech 
is nothing,
    Yet the unshaped use of it doth move
    The hearers to collection; they aim at it
,
    And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;
    Which, as her winks and nods and gestu
res yield them,
    Indeed would make one think there might be thought,
    Though nothing sure, y
et much unhappily.
  Hor. 'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew
    Dangerous conjec
tures in ill-breeding minds.
  Queen. Let her come in.
                                           
    [Exit Gentleman.]
    [Aside] To my sick soul (as sin's true nature is)
    Each toy seems Pro
logue to some great amiss.
    So full of artless jealousy is guilt
    It spills itself in fearin
g to be spilt.

                 Enter Ophelia distracted.

  Oph. Where is the beauteous Majest
y of Denmark?
  Queen. How now, Ophelia?
  Oph. (sings)
         How should I your true-love know

           From another one?
         By his cockle bat and' staff
           And his sandal sho
on.

  Queen. Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
  Oph. Say you? Nay, pray You mark.

  
  (Sings) He is dead and gone, lady,
              He is dead and gone;
            At his head a 
grass-green turf,
              At his heels a stone.

    O, ho!
  Queen. Nay, but Ophelia-
  
Oph. Pray you mark.

    (Sings) White his shroud as the mountain snow-

                    Ent
er King.

  Queen. Alas, look here, my lord!
  Oph. (Sings)
           Larded all with sweet flo
wers;
         Which bewept to the grave did not go
           With true-love showers.

  King. 
How do you, pretty lady?
  Oph. Well, God dild you! They say the owl was a baker's
daughter.
    
Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be. God
be at
    your table!
  King. Conceit
 upon her father.
  Oph. Pray let's have no words of this; but when they ask, you
what
    it mea
ns, say you this:

    (Sings) To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,
              All in the morni
ng bedtime,
            And I a maid at your window,
              To be your Valentine.

      
      Then up he rose and donn'd his clo'es
              And dupp'd the chamber door,
           
 Let in the maid, that out a maid
              Never departed more.

  King. Pretty Ophelia!
  
Oph. Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't!

    [Sings] By Gis and by Saint Charity,

              Alack, and fie for shame!
            Young men will do't if they come to't
      
        By Cock, they are to blame.

            Quoth she, 'Before you tumbled me,
             
 You promis'd me to wed.'

    He answers:

            'So would I 'a' done, by yonder sun,
  
            An thou hadst not come to my bed.'

  King. How long hath she been thus?
  Oph. I hop
e all will be well. We must be patient; but I cannot
    choose but weep to think they would lay hi
m i' th' cold
ground.
    My brother shall know of it; and so I thank you for your good
    couns
el. Come, my coach! Good night, ladies. Good night,
sweet
    ladies. Good night, good night.     
                    Exit
  King. Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.
              
                                   [Exit Horatio.]

    O, this is the poison of deep grief; it sp
rings
    All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
    When sorrows come, they come not 
single spies.
    But in battalions! First, her father slain;
    Next, your son gone, and he most
 violent author
    Of his own just remove; the people muddied,
    Thick and and unwholesome in t
heir thoughts and whispers
    For good Polonius' death, and we have done but greenly
    In hugge
r-mugger to inter him; poor Ophelia
    Divided from herself and her fair judgment,
    Without th
e which we are pictures or mere beasts;
    Last, and as much containing as all these,
    Her bro
ther is in secret come from France;
    And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
    Feeds on his w
onder, keep, himself in clouds,
    With pestilent speeches of his father's death,
    Wherein nec
essity, of matter beggar'd,
    Will nothing stick our person to arraign
    In ear and ear. O my 
dear Gertrude, this,
    Like to a murd'ring piece, in many places
    Give me superfluous death. 
                 A noise within.
  Queen. Alack, what noise is this?
  King. Where are my Switzers
? Let them guard the door.

                     Enter a Messenger.

    What is the matter?
  
Mess. Save Yourself, my lord:
    The ocean, overpeering of his list,
    Eats not the flats with 
more impetuous haste
    Than Young Laertes, in a riotous head,
    O'erbears Your offices. The ra
bble call him lord;
    And, as the world were now but to begin,
    Antiquity forgot, custom not 
known,
    The ratifiers and props of every word,
    They cry 'Choose we! Laertes shall be king!'

    Caps, hands, and tongues applaud it to the clouds,
    'Laertes shall be king! Laertes king!'

                                                 A noise within.
  Queen. How cheerfully on the f
alse trail they cry!
    O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!
  King. The doors are broke.


                    Enter Laertes with others.

  Laer. Where is this king?- Sirs, staid you all
 without.
  All. No, let's come in!
  Laer. I pray you give me leave.
  All. We will, we will!
 
 Laer. I thank you. Keep the door.      [Exeunt his Followers.]
    O thou vile king,
    Give me 
my father!
  Queen. Calmly, good Laertes.
  Laer. That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bast
ard;
    Cries cuckold to my father; brands the harlot
    Even here between the chaste unsmirched
 brows
    Of my true mother.
  King. What is the cause, Laertes,
    That thy rebellion looks so
 giantlike?
    Let him go, Gertrude. Do not fear our person.
    There's such divinity doth hedge
 a king
    That treason can but peep to what it would,
    Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laer
tes,
    Why thou art thus incens'd. Let him go, Gertrude.
    Speak, man.
  Laer. Where is my fa
ther?
  King. Dead.
  Queen. But not by him!
  King. Let him demand his fill.
  Laer. How came h
e dead? I'll not be juggled with:
    To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil
    Conscie
nce and grace, to the profoundest pit!
    I dare damnation. To this point I stand,
    That both 
the world, I give to negligence,
    Let come what comes; only I'll be reveng'd
    Most throughly
 for my father.
  King. Who shall stay you?
  Laer. My will, not all the world!
    And for my me
ans, I'll husband them so well
    They shall go far with little.
  King. Good Laertes,
    If yo
u desire to know the certainty
    Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge
    That
 sweepstake you will draw both friend and foe,
    Winner and loser?
  Laer. None but his enemies.

  King. Will you know them then?
  Laer. To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms
    And,
 like the kind life-rend'ring pelican,
    Repast them with my blood.
  King. Why, now You speak

    Like a good child and a true gentleman.
    That I am guiltless of your father's death,
    An
d am most sensibly in grief for it,
    It shall as level to your judgment pierce
    As day does 
to your eye.
                              A noise within: 'Let her come in.'
  Laer. How now? Wha
t noise is that?

                      Enter Ophelia.

    O heat, dry up my brains! Tears seve
n times salt
    Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!
    By heaven, thy madness shall be pa
id by weight
    Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!
    Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Op
helia!
    O heavens! is't possible a young maid's wits
    Should be as mortal as an old man's li
fe?
    Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,
    It sends some precious instance of itself

    After the thing it loves.

  Oph. (sings)
         They bore him barefac'd on the bier
   
        (Hey non nony, nony, hey nony)
         And in his grave rain'd many a tear.

    Fare yo
u well, my dove!
  Laer. Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
    It could not move th
us.
  Oph. You must sing 'A-down a-down, and you call him a-down-a.'
O,
    how the wheel becomes
 it! It is the false steward, that stole
his
    master's daughter.
  Laer. This nothing's more t
han matter.
  Oph. There's rosemary, that's for remembrance. Pray you, love,
    remember. And the
re is pansies, that's for thoughts.
  Laer. A document in madness! Thoughts and remembrance fitted.

  Oph. There's fennel for you, and columbines. There's rue for
you,
    and here's some for me. 
We may call it herb of grace o'
Sundays.
    O, you must wear your rue with a difference! There's 
a daisy.
I
    would give you some violets, but they wither'd all when my
father
    died. They 
say he made a good end.

    [Sings] For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.

  Laer. Thought and a
ffliction, passion, hell itself,
    She turns to favour and to prettiness.
  Oph. (sings)
      
   And will he not come again?
         And will he not come again?
           No, no, he is dead;

           Go to thy deathbed;
         He never will come again.

         His beard was as wh
ite as snow,
         All flaxen was his poll.
           He is gone, he is gone,
           And 
we cast away moan.
         God 'a'mercy on his soul!

    And of all Christian souls, I pray God
. God b' wi' you.
Exit.
  Laer. Do you see this, O God?
  King. Laertes, I must commune with your
 grief,
    Or you deny me right. Go but apart,
    Make choice of whom your wisest friends you wi
ll,
    And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me.
    If by direct or by collateral hand
 
   They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,
    Our crown, our life, and all that we call ou
rs,
    To you in satisfaction; but if not,
    Be you content to lend your patience to us,
    A
nd we shall jointly labour with your soul
    To give it due content.
  Laer. Let this be so.
   
 His means of death, his obscure funeral-
    No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,
    
No noble rite nor formal ostentation,-
    Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
    Th
at I must call't in question.
  King. So you shall;
    And where th' offence is let the great axe
 fall.
    I pray you go with me.
                                                          Exeunt

Scene VI.
Elsinore. Another room in the Castle.

Enter Horatio with an Atte
ndant.

  Hor. What are they that would speak with me?
  Servant. Seafaring men, sir. They say th
ey have letters for
you.
  Hor. Let them come in.
                                               
[Exit Attendant.]
    I do not know from what part of the world
    I should be greeted, if not fr
om Lord Hamlet.

                          Enter Sailors.

  Sailor. God bless you, sir.
  Hor.
 Let him bless thee too.
  Sailor. 'A shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter for
you,
    
sir,- it comes from th' ambassador that was bound for
England- if
    your name be Horatio, as I a
m let to know it is.
  Hor. (reads the letter) 'Horatio, when thou shalt have
overlook'd
    this
, give these fellows some means to the King. They have
    letters for him. Ere we were two days ol
d at sea, a pirate of

    very warlike appointment gave us chase. Finding ourselves too
    slow
 of sail, we put on a compelled valour, and in the
grapple I
    boarded them. On the instant they
 got clear of our ship; so I
    alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with me like
thieves

    of mercy; but they knew what they did: I am to do a good turn
for
    them. Let the King hav

thou
    to me with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death.
 I have
words

Scene VII.
Elsinore. Another room in the Castle.


Enter King and Laertes.

  King. Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
    And You must
 put me in your heart for friend,
    Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
    That he whi
ch hath your noble father slain
    Pursued my life.
  Laer. It well appears. But tell me
    Why
 you proceeded not against these feats
    So crimeful and so capital in nature,
    As by your sa
fety, wisdom, all things else,
    You mainly were stirr'd up.
  King. O, for two special reasons,

    Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,
    But yet to me they are strong. The Queen 
his mother
    Lives almost by his looks; and for myself,-
    My virtue or my plague, be it eithe
r which,-
    She's so conjunctive to my life and soul
    That, as the star moves not but in his 
sphere,
    I could not but by her. The other motive
    Why to a public count I might not go
   
 Is the great love the general gender bear him,
    Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,

    Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
    Convert his gives to graces; so that m
y arrows,
    Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,
    Would have reverted to my bow again,

    And not where I had aim'd them.
  Laer. And so have I a noble father lost;
    A sister driven
 into desp'rate terms,
    Whose worth, if praises may go back again,
    Stood challenger on moun
t of all the age
    For her perfections. But my revenge will come.
  King. Break not your sleeps 
for that. You must not think
    That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
    That we can let ou
r beard be shook with danger,
    And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more.
    I lov'd y
our father, and we love ourself,
    And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine-

              
   Enter a Messenger with letters.

    How now? What news?
  Mess. Letters, my lord, from Hamlet
:
    This to your Majesty; this to the Queen.
  King. From Hamlet? Who brought them?
  Mess. Sai
lors, my lord, they say; I saw them not.
    They were given me by Claudio; he receiv'd them
    O
f him that brought them.
  King. Laertes, you shall hear them.
    Leave us.
                    
                             Exit Messenger.
    [Reads]'High and Mighty,-You shall know I am set n
aked on
your
    kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes;
    when I shall (
first asking your pardon thereunto) recount the
    occasion of my sudden and more strange return.

                                                     'HAMLET.'
    What should this mean? Are all 
the rest come back?
    Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?
  Laer. Know you the hand?
  King
. 'Tis Hamlet's character. 'Naked!'
    And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'
    Can you adv
ise me?
  Laer. I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come!
    It warms the very sickness in my h
eart
    That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,
    'Thus didest thou.'
  King. If it be so
, Laertes
    (As how should it be so? how otherwise?),
    Will you be rul'd by me?
  Laer. Ay m
y lord,
    So you will not o'errule me to a peace.
  King. To thine own peace. If he be now retur
n'd
    As checking at his voyage, and that he means
    No more to undertake it, I will work him

    To exploit now ripe in my device,
    Under the which he shall not choose but fall;
    And f
or his death no wind shall breathe
    But even his mother shall uncharge the practice
    And cal
l it accident.
  Laer. My lord, I will be rul'd;
    The rather, if you could devise it so
    Th
at I might be the organ.
  King. It falls right.
    You have been talk'd of since your travel muc
h,
    And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality
    Wherein they say you shine, Your sum of par
ts
    Did not together pluck such envy from him
    As did that one; and that, in my regard,
   
 Of the unworthiest siege.
  Laer. What part is that, my lord?
  King. A very riband in the cap of
 youth-
    Yet needfull too; for youth no less becomes
    The light and careless livery that it 
wears
    Than settled age his sables and his weeds,
    Importing health and graveness. Two month
s since
    Here was a gentleman of Normandy.
    I have seen myself, and serv'd against, the Fren
ch,
    And they can well on horseback; but this gallant
    Had witchcraft in't. He grew unto his
 seat,
    And to such wondrous doing brought his horse
    As had he been incorps'd and demi-natu
r'd
    With the brave beast. So far he topp'd my thought
    That I, in forgery of shapes and tri
cks,
    Come short of what he did.
  Laer. A Norman was't?
  King. A Norman.
  Laer. Upon my li
fe, Lamound.
  King. The very same.
  Laer. I know him well. He is the broach indeed
    And gem 
of all the nation.
  King. He made confession of you;
    And gave you such a masterly report
   
 For art and exercise in your defence,
    And for your rapier most especially,
    That he cried 
out 'twould be a sight indeed
    If one could match you. The scrimers of their nation
    He swor
e had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
    If you oppos'd them. Sir, this report of his
    Did Ham
let so envenom with his envy
    That he could nothing do but wish and beg
    Your sudden coming 
o'er to play with you.
    Now, out of this-
  Laer. What out of this, my lord?
  King. Laertes, 
was your father dear to you?
    Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
    A face without a he
art,'
  Laer. Why ask you this?
  King. Not that I think you did not love your father;
    But th
at I know love is begun by time,
    And that I see, in passages of proof,
    Time qualifies the 
spark and fire of it.
    There lives within the very flame of love
    A kind of wick or snuff th
at will abate it;
    And nothing is at a like goodness still;
    For goodness, growing to a plur
isy,
    Dies in his own too-much. That we would do,
    We should do when we would; for this 'wou
ld' changes,
    And hath abatements and delays as many
    As there are tongues, are hands, are a
ccidents;
    And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
    That hurts by easing. But to 
the quick o' th' ulcer!
    Hamlet comes back. What would you undertake
    To show yourself your 
father's son in deed
    More than in words?
  Laer. To cut his throat i' th' church!
  King. No 
place indeed should murther sanctuarize;
    Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,
   
 Will you do this? Keep close within your chamber.
    Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home
.
    We'll put on those shall praise your excellence
    And set a double varnish on the fame
  
  The Frenchman gave you; bring you in fine together
    And wager on your heads. He, being remiss,

    Most generous, and free from all contriving,
    Will not peruse the foils; so that with ease
,
    Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
    A sword unbated, and, in a pass of practice,

    Requite him for your father.
  Laer. I will do't!
    And for that purpose I'll anoint my swo
rd.
    I bought an unction of a mountebank,
    So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
    Where
 it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
    Collected from all simples that have virtue
    Under th
e moon, can save the thing from death
    This is but scratch'd withal. I'll touch my point
    Wi
th this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
    It may be death.
  King. Let's further think 
of this,
    Weigh what convenience both of time and means
    May fit us to our shape. If this sh
ould fall,
    And that our drift look through our bad performance.
    'Twere better not assay'd.
 Therefore this project
    Should have a back or second, that might hold
    If this did blast in
 proof. Soft! let me see.
    We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings-
    I ha't!
    When in
 your motion you are hot and dry-
    As make your bouts more violent to that end-
    And that he
 calls for drink, I'll have prepar'd him
    A chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,
    If 
he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
    Our purpose may hold there.- But stay, what noise,

 
                          Enter Queen.

    How now, sweet queen?
  Queen. One woe doth tread upo
n another's heel,
    So fast they follow. Your sister's drown'd, Laertes.
  Laer. Drown'd! O, whe
re?
  Queen. There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
    That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy 
stream.
    There with fantastic garlands did she come
    Of crowflowers, nettles, daisies, and l
ong purples,
    That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
    But our cold maids do dead men's 
fingers call them.
    There on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds
    Clamb'ring to hang, an en
vious sliver broke,
    When down her weedy trophies and herself
    Fell in the weeping brook. He
r clothes spread wide
    And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up;
    Which time she chaunted 
snatches of old tunes,
    As one incapable of her own distress,
    Or like a creature native and
 indued
    Unto that element; but long it could not be
    Till that her garments, heavy with the
ir drink,
    Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay
    To muddy death.
  Laer. Alas, the
n she is drown'd?
  Queen. Drown'd, drown'd.
  Laer. Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
 
   And therefore I forbid my tears; but yet
    It is our trick; nature her custom holds,
    Let 
shame say what it will. When these are gone,
    The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord.
    I have
 a speech of fire, that fain would blaze
    But that this folly douts it.                         
 Exit.
  King. Let's follow, Gertrude.
    How much I had to do to calm his rage I
    Now fear I
 this will give it start again;
    Therefore let's follow.
                                      
                   Exeunt.

ACT V. Scene I.
Elsinore. A churchyard.

Enter tw
o Clowns, [with spades and pickaxes].

  Clown. Is she to be buried in Christian burial when she

wilfully
    seeks her own salvation?
  Other. I tell thee she is; therefore make her grave straig
ht.
    The crowner hath sate on her, and finds it Christian burial.
  Clown. How can that be, unl
ess she drown'd herself in her own
    defence?
  Other. Why, 'tis found so.
  Clown. It must be 
se offendendo; it cannot be else. For here
lies
    the point: if I drown myself wittingly, it arg
ues an act; and
an
    act hath three branches-it is to act, to do, and to perform;
    argal, sh
e drown'd herself wittingly.
  Other. Nay, but hear you, Goodman Delver!
  Clown. Give me leave. H
ere lies the water; good. Here stands
the
    man; good. If the man go to this water and drown him
self, it
is,
    will he nill he, he goes- mark you that. But if the water
come to
    him and d
rown him, he drowns not himself. Argal, he that is
not
    guilty of his own death shortens not hi
s own life.
  Other. But is this law?
  Clown. Ay, marry, is't- crowner's quest law.
  Other. Wil
l you ha' the truth an't? If this had not been a
    gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o
' Christian
burial.
  Clown. Why, there thou say'st! And the more pity that great
folk
    shoul
d have count'nance in this world to drown or hang
themselves
    more than their even-Christian. C
ome, my spade! There is no
    ancient gentlemen but gard'ners, ditchers, and grave-makers.
They

    hold up Adam's profession.
  Other. Was he a gentleman?
  Clown. 'A was the first that ever bo
re arms.
  Other. Why, he had none.
  Clown. What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the
Sc
ripture?
    The Scripture says Adam digg'd. Could he dig without arms?
I'll
    put another ques
tion to thee. If thou answerest me not to the
    purpose, confess thyself-
  Other. Go to!
  Clo
wn. What is he that builds stronger than either the mason,
the
    shipwright, or the carpenter?

  Other. The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand
    tenants.
  Clown. I like thy wi
t well, in good faith. The gallows does
well.
    But how does it well? It does well to those that
 do ill. Now,
    thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the
    church. Argal, t
he gallows may do well to thee. To't again,
come!
  Other. Who builds stronger than a mason, a shi
pwright, or a
    carpenter?
  Clown. Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
  Other. Marry, now I can tel
l!
  Clown. To't.
  Other. Mass, I cannot tell.

                 Enter Hamlet and Horatio afar 
off.

  Clown. Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull ass
will
    not mend his pace 
with beating; and when you are ask'd this
    question next, say 'a grave-maker.' The houses he mak
es lasts
    till doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan; fetch me a stoup of
    liquor.
            
                                [Exit Second Clown.]


                       [Clown digs and] si
ngs.

       In youth when I did love, did love,
         Methought it was very sweet;
       To
 contract- O- the time for- a- my behove,
         O, methought there- a- was nothing- a- meet.


  Ham. Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings
at
    grave-making?
  Hor. Cust
om hath made it in him a property of easiness.
  Ham. 'Tis e'en so. The hand of little employment h
ath the
daintier
    sense.
  Clown. (sings)
         But age with his stealing steps
         
  Hath clawed me in his clutch,
         And hath shipped me intil the land,
           As if I ha
d never been such.
                                            [Throws up a skull.]

  Ham. That 
skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once. How
the
    knave jowls it to the ground,as if 'twe
re Cain's jawbone,
that
    did the first murther! This might be the pate of a
Politician,
    w
hich this ass now o'erreaches; one that would circumvent
God,
    might it not?
  Hor. It might, 
my lord.
  Ham. Or of a courtier, which could say 'Good morrow, sweet
lord!
    How dost thou, go
od lord?' This might be my Lord Such-a-one,
that
    prais'd my Lord Such-a-one's horse when he me
ant to beg it-
might
    it not?
  Hor. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Why, e'en so! and now my Lady Worm's
, chapless, and
knock'd
    about the mazzard with a sexton's spade. Here's fine
revolution,
   
 and we had the trick to see't. Did these bones cost no more
the
    breeding but to play at logge
ts with 'em? Mine ache to think
    on't.
  Clown. (Sings)
         A pickaxe and a spade, a spad
e,
           For and a shrouding sheet;
         O, a Pit of clay for to be made
           For 
such a guest is meet.
                                      Throws up [another skull].

  Ham. Th
ere's another. Why may not that be the skull of a
lawyer?
    Where be his quiddits now, his quill
ets, his cases, his
tenures,
    and his tricks? Why does he suffer this rude knave now to
knock

    him about the sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell
him
    of his action of battery?
 Hum! This fellow might be in's time
a
    great buyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizanc
es,
his
    fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries. Is this the fine
of
    his fines, and t
he recovery of his recoveries, to have his
fine
    pate full of fine dirt? Will his vouchers vouc
h him no more
of
    his purchases, and double ones too, than the length and
breadth
    of a pa
ir of indentures? The very conveyances of his lands
will
    scarcely lie in this box; and must th
' inheritor himself have
no
    more, ha?
  Hor. Not a jot more, my lord.
  Ham. Is not parchmen
t made of sheepskins?
  Hor. Ay, my lord, And of calveskins too.
  Ham. They are sheep and calves 
which seek out assurance in
that. I
    will speak to this fellow. Whose grave's this, sirrah?
  
Clown. Mine, sir.

    [Sings] O, a pit of clay for to be made
              For such a guest is 
meet.

  Ham. I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in't.
  Clown. You lie out on't, sir, an
d therefore 'tis not yours.
    For my part, I do not lie in't, yet it is mine.
  Ham. Thou dost l
ie in't, to be in't and say it is thine. 'Tis
for
    the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou 
liest.
  Clown. 'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away again from me to you.
  Ham. What man dost thou
 dig it for?
  Clown. For no man, sir.
  Ham. What woman then?
  Clown. For none neither.
  Ham.
 Who is to be buried in't?
  Clown. One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's
dead.
  
Ham. How absolute the knave is! We must speak by the card, or
    equivocation will undo us. By the
 Lord, Horatio, this three
years
    I have taken note of it, the age is grown so picked that the

toe
    of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he
galls
    his kibe.- How long h
ast thou been a grave-maker?
  Clown. Of all the days i' th' year, I came to't that day that
our

    last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.
  Ham. How long is that since?
  Clown. Cannot you tell 
that? Every fool can tell that. It was
the
    very day that young Hamlet was born- he that is mad
, and sent
    into England.
  Ham. Ay, marry, why was be sent into England?
  Clown. Why, becaus
e 'a was mad. 'A shall recover his wits
there;
    or, if 'a do not, 'tis no great matter there.

  Ham. Why?
  Clown. 'Twill not he seen in him there. There the men are as
mad as
    he.
  Ham.
 How came he mad?
  Clown. Very strangely, they say.
  Ham. How strangely?
  Clown. Faith, e'en w
ith losing his wits.
  Ham. Upon what ground?
  Clown. Why, here in Denmark. I have been sexton he
re, man and
boy
    thirty years.
  Ham. How long will a man lie i' th' earth ere he rot?
  Clow
n. Faith, if 'a be not rotten before 'a die (as we have
many
    pocky corses now-a-days that will
 scarce hold the laying in,
I
    will last you some eight year or nine year. A tanner will
last

    you nine year.
  Ham. Why he more than another?
  Clown. Why, sir, his hide is so tann'd with
 his trade that 'a
will
    keep out water a great while; and your water is a sore
decayer of
  
  your whoreson dead body. Here's a skull now. This skull hath
lien
    you i' th' earth three-and
-twenty years.
  Ham. Whose was it?
  Clown. A whoreson, mad fellow's it was. Whose do you think i
t
was?
  Ham. Nay, I know not.
  Clown. A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! 'A pour'd a flagon

of
    Rhenish on my head once. This same skull, sir, was Yorick's
    skull, the King's jester.

  Ham. This?
  Clown. E'en that.
  Ham. Let me see. [Takes the skull.] Alas, poor Yorick! I knew

him,
    Horatio. A fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy.
He
    hath borne me on his
 back a thousand times. And now how
abhorred
    in my imagination it is! My gorge rises at it. He
re hung
those
    lips that I have kiss'd I know not how oft. Where be your
gibes
    now? your 
gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment that
    were wont to set the table on a roar? Not o
ne now, to mock
your
    own grinning? Quite chap- fall'n? Now get you to my lady's
    chamber, 
and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this
    favour she must come. Make her laugh at that
. Prithee,
Horatio,
    tell me one thing.
  Hor. What's that, my lord?
  Ham. Dost thou think A
lexander look'd o' this fashion i' th'
earth?
  Hor. E'en so.
  Ham. And smelt so? Pah!
        
                                  [Puts down the skull.]
  Hor. E'en so, my lord.
  Ham. To what b
ase uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not
    imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till
 he find it
    stopping a bunghole?
  Hor. 'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.
  H
am. No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with
modesty
    enough, and likelihood to lea
d it; as thus: Alexander died,
    Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust
i
s
    earth; of earth we make loam; and why of that loam (whereto
he
    was converted) might the
y not stop a beer barrel?
    Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
    Might stop a hole to 
keep the wind away.
    O, that that earth which kept the world in awe
    Should patch a wall t' 
expel the winter's flaw!
    But soft! but soft! aside! Here comes the King-

    Enter [priests 
with] a coffin [in funeral procession], King,
             Queen, Laertes, with Lords attendant.]


    The Queen, the courtiers. Who is this they follow?
    And with such maimed rites? This doth 
betoken
    The corse they follow did with desp'rate hand
    Fordo it own life. 'Twas of some est
ate.
    Couch we awhile, and mark.
                                         [Retires with Horatio
.]

  Laer. What ceremony else?
  Ham. That is Laertes,
    A very noble youth. Mark.
  Laer. W
hat ceremony else?
  Priest. Her obsequies have been as far enlarg'd
    As we have warranty. Her 
death was doubtful;
    And, but that great command o'ersways the order,
    She should in ground 
unsanctified have lodg'd
    Till the last trumpet. For charitable prayers,
    Shards, flints, an
d pebbles should be thrown on her.
    Yet here she is allow'd her virgin rites,
    Her maiden st
rewments, and the bringing home
    Of bell and burial.
  Laer. Must there no more be done?
  Pri
est. No more be done.
    We should profane the service of the dead
    To sing a requiem and such
 rest to her
    As to peace-parted souls.
  Laer. Lay her i' th' earth;
    And from her fair an
d unpolluted flesh
    May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,
    A minist'ring angel s
hall my sister be
    When thou liest howling.
  Ham. What, the fair Ophelia?
  Queen. Sweets to 
the sweet! Farewell.
                                             [Scatters flowers.]
    I hop'd 
thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
    I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,

    And not have strew'd thy grave.
  Laer. O, treble woe
    Fall ten times treble on that cursed
 head
    Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
    Depriv'd thee of! Hold off the earth awhi
le,
    Till I have caught her once more in mine arms.
                                           
  Leaps in the grave.
    Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead
    Till of this flat a mount
ain you have made
    T' o'ertop old Pelion or the skyish head
    Of blue Olympus.
  Ham. [comes
 forward] What is he whose grief
    Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow
    Conjures t
he wand'ring stars, and makes them stand
    Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,
    Hamlet th
e Dane.                    [Leaps in after Laertes.
  Laer. The devil take thy soul!
             
                               [Grapples with him].
  Ham. Thou pray'st not well.
    I prithee ta
ke thy fingers from my throat;
    For, though I am not splenitive and rash,
    Yet have I in me 
something dangerous,
    Which let thy wisdom fear. Hold off thy hand!
  King. Pluck them asunder.

  Queen. Hamlet, Hamlet!
  All. Gentlemen!
  Hor. Good my lord, be quiet.
             [The Att
endants part them, and they come out of the
                                                       
  grave.]
  Ham. Why, I will fight with him upon this theme
    Until my eyelids will no longer wa
g.
  Queen. O my son, what theme?
  Ham. I lov'd Ophelia. Forty thousand brothers
    Could not (
with all their quantity of love)
    Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?
  King. O, he is m
ad, Laertes.
  Queen. For love of God, forbear him!
  Ham. 'Swounds, show me what thou't do.
    
Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?
    Woo't drink up esill? eat a crocodile?

    I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?
    To outface me with leaping in her grave?
    Be
 buried quick with her, and so will I.
    And if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
    Mill
ions of acres on us, till our ground,
    Singeing his pate against the burning zone,
    Make Oss
a like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
    I'll rant as well as thou.
  Queen. This is mere madness
;
    And thus a while the fit will work on him.
    Anon, as patient as the female dove
    When
 that her golden couplets are disclos'd,
    His silence will sit drooping.
  Ham. Hear you, sir!

    What is the reason that you use me thus?
    I lov'd you ever. But it is no matter.
    Let H
ercules himself do what he may,
    The cat will mew, and dog will have his day.
Exit.
  King. I 
pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.
                                                   Exit Hor
atio.
    [To Laertes] Strengthen your patience in our last night's
speech.
    We'll put the mat
ter to the present push.-
    Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.-
    This grave shall h
ave a living monument.
    An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
    Till then in patience our pr
oceeding be.
                                                         Exeunt.




Scene II.
E
lsinore. A hall in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet and Horatio.

  Ham. So much for this, sir; now sha
ll you see the other.
    You do remember all the circumstance?
  Hor. Remember it, my lord!
  Ha
m. Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting
    That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay

    Worse than the mutinies in the bilboes. Rashly-
    And prais'd be rashness for it; let us know
,
    Our indiscretion sometime serves us well
    When our deep plots do pall; and that should le
arn us
    There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
    Rough-hew them how we will-
  Hor. That i
s most certain.
  Ham. Up from my cabin,
    My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
    Grop'd
 I to find out them; had my desire,
    Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew
    To mine ow
n room again; making so bold
    (My fears forgetting manners) to unseal
    Their grand commissio
n; where I found, Horatio
    (O royal knavery!), an exact command,
    Larded with many several s
orts of reasons,
    Importing Denmark's health, and England's too,
    With, hoo! such bugs and g
oblins in my life-
    That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
    No, not to stay the finding o
f the axe,
    My head should be struck off.
  Hor. Is't possible?
  Ham. Here's the commission; 
read it at more leisure.
    But wilt thou bear me how I did proceed?
  Hor. I beseech you.
  Ham
. Being thus benetted round with villanies,
    Or I could make a prologue to my brains,
    They 
had begun the play. I sat me down;
    Devis'd a new commission; wrote it fair.
    I once did hol
d it, as our statists do,
    A baseness to write fair, and labour'd much
    How to forget that l
earning; but, sir, now
    It did me yeoman's service. Wilt thou know
    Th' effect of what I wro
te?
  Hor. Ay, good my lord.
  Ham. An earnest conjuration from the King,
    As England was his 
faithful tributary,
    As love between them like the palm might flourish,
    As peace should sti
ll her wheaten garland wear
    And stand a comma 'tween their amities,
    And many such-like as'
s of great charge,
    That, on the view and knowing of these contents,
    Without debatement fur
ther, more or less,
    He should the bearers put to sudden death,
    Not shriving time allow'd.

  Hor. How was this seal'd?
  Ham. Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
    I had my father's s
ignet in my purse,
    Which was the model of that Danish seal;
    Folded the writ up in the form
 of th' other,
    Subscrib'd it, gave't th' impression, plac'd it safely,
    The changeling neve
r known. Now, the next day
    Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent
    Thou know'st al
ready.
  Hor. So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.
  Ham. Why, man, they did make love to this
 employment!
    They are not near my conscience; their defeat
    Does by their own insinuation g
row.
    'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
    Between the pass and fell incensed points

    Of mighty opposites.
  Hor. Why, what a king is this!
  Ham. Does it not, thinks't thee, stan
d me now upon-
    He that hath kill'd my king, and whor'd my mother;
    Popp'd in between th' el
ection and my hopes;
    Thrown out his angle for my proper life,
    And with such coz'nage- is't
 not perfect conscience
    To quit him with this arm? And is't not to be damn'd
    To let this c
anker of our nature come
    In further evil?
  Hor. It must be shortly known to him from England

    What is the issue of the business there.
  Ham. It will be short; the interim is mine,
    An
d a man's life is no more than to say 'one.'
    But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
    That to La
ertes I forgot myself,
    For by the image of my cause I see
    The portraiture of his. I'll cou
rt his favours.
    But sure the bravery of his grief did put me
    Into a tow'ring passion.
  H
or. Peace! Who comes here?

                 Enter young Osric, a courtier.

  Osr. Your lordshi
p is right welcome back to Denmark.
  Ham. I humbly thank you, sir. [Aside to Horatio] Dost know th
is
    waterfly?
  Hor. [aside to Hamlet] No, my good lord.
  Ham. [aside to Horatio] Thy state i
s the more gracious; for
'tis a
    vice to know him. He hath much land, and fertile. Let a beast

be
    lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at the king's mess.
'Tis
    a chough; but, as I
 say, spacious in the possession of dirt.

  Osr. Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I 
should
impart
    a thing to you from his Majesty.
  Ham. I will receive it, sir, with all dilige
nce of spirit. Put
your
    bonnet to his right use. 'Tis for the head.
  Osr. I thank your lords
hip, it is very hot.
  Ham. No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly.
  Osr. It is in
different cold, my lord, indeed.
  Ham. But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my
complexi
on.
  Osr. Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry, as 'twere- I
cannot
    tell how. But, my lor
d, his Majesty bade me signify to you
that
    he has laid a great wager on your head. Sir, this i
s the
matter-
  Ham. I beseech you remember.
                           [Hamlet moves him to put 
on his hat.]
  Osr. Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here
is
    newly come 
to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute
gentleman,
    full of most excellent differences, of ve
ry soft society and
    great showing. Indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the
card
    or c
alendar of gentry; for you shall find in him the
continent of
    what part a gentleman would see.

  Ham. Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you; though, I

    know, to divide him inven
torially would dozy th' arithmetic
of
    memory, and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick 
sail.
    But, in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of
great
    article, and his 
infusion of such dearth and rareness as, to
make
    true diction of him, his semblable is his mir
ror, and who
else
    would trace him, his umbrage, nothing more.
  Osr. Your lordship speaks mos
t infallibly of him.
  Ham. The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our
more
    ra
wer breath?
  Osr. Sir?
  Hor [aside to Hamlet] Is't not possible to understand in
another
    t
ongue? You will do't, sir, really.
  Ham. What imports the nomination of this gentleman?
  Osr. Of
 Laertes?
  Hor. [aside] His purse is empty already. All's golden words are
    spent.
  Ham. Of 
him, sir.
  Osr. I know you are not ignorant-
  Ham. I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you d
id, it would
not
    much approve me. Well, sir?
  Osr. You are not ignorant of what excellence L
aertes is-
  Ham. I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in
    excellence; but t
o know a man well were to know himself.
  Osr. I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation l
aid on
him
    by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.
  Ham. What's his weapon?
  Osr. Rapier and
 dagger.
  Ham. That's two of his weapons- but well.
  Osr. The King, sir, hath wager'd with him s
ix Barbary horses;
    against the which he has impon'd, as I take it, six French
    rapiers and 
poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers,
and
    so. Three of the carriages, in faith, ar
e very dear to fancy,
    very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of
    very l
iberal conceit.
  Ham. What call you the carriages?
  Hor. [aside to Hamlet] I knew you must be ed
ified by the
margent
    ere you had done.
  Osr. The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
  Ham. Th
e phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could
    carry cannon by our sides. I would it 
might be hangers till
then.
    But on! Six Barbary horses against six French swords, their
    a
ssigns, and three liberal-conceited carriages: that's the
French
    bet against the Danish. Why i
s this all impon'd, as you call
it?
  Osr. The King, sir, hath laid that, in a dozen passes betwee
n
    yourself and him, he shall not exceed you three hits; he hath
    laid on twelve for nine, a
nd it would come to immediate trial
    if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.
  Ham. How if
 I answer no?
  Osr. I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
  Ham. Sir, I will w
alk here in the hall. If it please his
Majesty,
    it is the breathing time of day with me. Let t
he foils be
    brought, the gentleman willing, and the King hold his
purpose,
    I will win for
 him if I can; if not, I will gain nothing but
my
    shame and the odd hits.
  Osr. Shall I rede
liver you e'en so?
  Ham. To this effect, sir, after what flourish your nature will.
  Osr. I comm
end my duty to your lordship.
  Ham. Yours, yours. [Exit Osric.] He does well to commend it
    hi
mself; there are no tongues else for's turn.
  Hor. This lapwing runs away with the shell on his he
ad.
  Ham. He did comply with his dug before he suck'd it. Thus has
he,
    and many more of the 
same bevy that I know the drossy age
dotes
    on, only got the tune of the time and outward habit
 of
encounter-
    a kind of yesty collection, which carries them through and
    through the mos
t fann'd and winnowed opinions; and do but
blow
    them to their trial-the bubbles are out,

  
                          Enter a Lord.

  Lord. My lord, his Majesty commended him to you by youn
g Osric,
who
    brings back to him, that you attend him in the hall. He sends
to
    know if yo
ur pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you
will
    take longer time.
  Ham. I am constan
t to my purposes; they follow the King's
pleasure.
    If his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now o
r whensoever,
provided
    I be so able as now.
  Lord. The King and Queen and all are coming dow
n.
  Ham. In happy time.
  Lord. The Queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to
    La
ertes before you fall to play.
  Ham. She well instructs me.
                                     
               [Exit Lord.]
  Hor. You will lose this wager, my lord.
  Ham. I do not think so. Si
nce he went into France I have been
in
    continual practice. I shall win at the odds. But thou w
ouldst
not
    think how ill all's here about my heart. But it is no matter.
  Hor. Nay, good my 
lord -
  Ham. It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gaingiving as
    would perhaps trouble 
a woman.
  Hor. If your mind dislike anything, obey it. I will forestall
their
    repair hither 
and say you are not fit.
  Ham. Not a whit, we defy augury; there's a special providence
in
    t
he fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not to come; if it
be
    not to come, it will be now; if
 it be not now, yet it will
come:
    the readiness is all. Since no man knows aught of what he
l
eaves,
    what is't to leave betimes? Let be.

    Enter King, Queen, Laertes, Osric, and Lords,
 with other
              Attendants with foils and gauntlets.
               A table and flagons 
of wine on it.

  King. Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
                    [The 
King puts Laertes' hand into Hamlet's.]
  Ham. Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong;
  
  But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.
    This presence knows,
    And you must needs have heard
, how I am punish'd
    With sore distraction. What I have done
    That might your nature, honour
, and exception
    Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
    Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? 
Never Hamlet.
    If Hamlet from himself be taken away,
    And when he's not himself does wrong L
aertes,
    Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
    Who does it, then? His madness. If't be
 so,
    Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
    His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
    Si
r, in this audience,
    Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd evil
    Free me so far in your most g
enerous thoughts
    That I have shot my arrow o'er the house
    And hurt my brother.
  Laer. I 
am satisfied in nature,
    Whose motive in this case should stir me most
    To my revenge. But i
n my terms of honour
    I stand aloof, and will no reconcilement
    Till by some elder masters o
f known honour
    I have a voice and precedent of peace
    To keep my name ungor'd. But till tha
t time
    I do receive your offer'd love like love,
    And will not wrong it.
  Ham. I embrace 
it freely,
    And will this brother's wager frankly play.
    Give us the foils. Come on.
  Laer
. Come, one for me.
  Ham. I'll be your foil, Laertes. In mine ignorance
    Your skill shall, lik
e a star i' th' darkest night,
    Stick fiery off indeed.
  Laer. You mock me, sir.
  Ham. No, b
y this hand.
  King. Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
    You know the wager?
  H
am. Very well, my lord.
    Your Grace has laid the odds o' th' weaker side.
  King. I do not fear
 it, I have seen you both;
    But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.
  Laer. This is t
oo heavy; let me see another.
  Ham. This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
          
                                      Prepare to play.
  Osr. Ay, my good lord.
  King. Set me the
 stoups of wine upon that table.
    If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
    Or quit in answer
 of the third exchange,
    Let all the battlements their ordnance fire;
    The King shall drink 
to Hamlet's better breath,
    And in the cup an union shall he throw
    Richer than that which f
our successive kings
    In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;
    And let the kettle to
 the trumpet speak,
    The trumpet to the cannoneer without,
    The cannons to the heavens, the 
heaven to earth,
    'Now the King drinks to Hamlet.' Come, begin.
    And you the judges, bear a 
wary eye.
  Ham. Come on, sir.
  Laer. Come, my lord.                                They play.
 
 Ham. One.
  Laer. No.
  Ham. Judgment!
  Osr. A hit, a very palpable hit.
  Laer. Well, again!

  King. Stay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
    Here's to thy health.
             
  [Drum; trumpets sound; a piece goes off [within].
    Give him the cup.
  Ham. I'll play this bo
ut first; set it by awhile.
    Come. (They play.) Another hit. What say you?
  Laer. A touch, a t
ouch; I do confess't.
  King. Our son shall win.
  Queen. He's fat, and scant of breath.
    Here
, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows.
    The Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
  Ham. Goo
d madam!
  King. Gertrude, do not drink.
  Queen. I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.          
Drinks.
  King. [aside] It is the poison'd cup; it is too late.
  Ham. I dare not drink yet, madam
; by-and-by.
  Queen. Come, let me wipe thy face.
  Laer. My lord, I'll hit him now.
  King. I do
 not think't.
  Laer. [aside] And yet it is almost against my conscience.
  Ham. Come for the thir
d, Laertes! You but dally.
    Pray you pass with your best violence;
    I am afeard you make a w
anton of me.
  Laer. Say you so? Come on.                               Play.
  Osr. Nothing neith
er way.
  Laer. Have at you now!
                [Laertes wounds Hamlet; then] in scuffling, they

                    change rapiers, [and Hamlet wounds Laertes].
  King. Part them! They are incen
s'd.
  Ham. Nay come! again!                         The Queen falls.

  Osr. Look to the Queen t
here, ho!
  Hor. They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?
  Osr. How is't, Laertes?
  Laer. 
Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric.
    I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.
  H
am. How does the Queen?
  King. She sounds to see them bleed.
  Queen. No, no! the drink, the drin
k! O my dear Hamlet!
    The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.                 [Dies.]
  Ham. O vil
lany! Ho! let the door be lock'd.
    Treachery! Seek it out.
                                    
            [Laertes falls.]
  Laer. It is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain;
    No medicine i
n the world can do thee good.
    In thee there is not half an hour of life.
    The treacherous i
nstrument is in thy hand,
    Unbated and envenom'd. The foul practice
    Hath turn'd itself on m
e. Lo, here I lie,
    Never to rise again. Thy mother's poison'd.
    I can no more. The King, th
e King's to blame.
  Ham. The point envenom'd too?
    Then, venom, to thy work.                  
  Hurts the King.
  All. Treason! treason!
  King. O, yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt.
  Ha
m. Here, thou incestuous, murd'rous, damned Dane,
    Drink off this potion! Is thy union here?
  
  Follow my mother.                                 King dies.
  Laer. He is justly serv'd.
    It
 is a poison temper'd by himself.
    Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet.
    Mine and my 
father's death come not upon thee,
    Nor thine on me!                                       Dies.

  Ham. Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.
    I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!

    You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
    That are but mutes or audience to this act
,
    Had I but time (as this fell sergeant, Death,
    Is strict in his arrest) O, I could tell y
ou-
    But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;
    Thou liv'st; report me and my cause aright
    To 
the unsatisfied.
  Hor. Never believe it.
    I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.
    Here's 
yet some liquor left.
  Ham. As th'art a man,
    Give me the cup. Let go! By heaven, I'll ha't.

    O good Horatio, what a wounded name
    (Things standing thus unknown) shall live behind me!
 
   If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,
    Absent thee from felicity awhile,
    And in this 
harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
    To tell my story.         [March afar off, and shot within
.]
    What warlike noise is this?
  Osr. Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
    T
o the ambassadors of England gives
    This warlike volley.
  Ham. O, I die, Horatio!
    The pot
ent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit.
    I cannot live to hear the news from England,
    But I d
o prophesy th' election lights
    On Fortinbras. He has my dying voice.
    So tell him, with th'
 occurrents, more and less,
    Which have solicited- the rest is silence.             Dies.
  Hor
. Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince,
    And flights of angels sing thee to thy re
st!
                                                 [March within.]
    Why does the drum come hi
ther?

    Enter Fortinbras and English Ambassadors, with Drum,
                  Colours, and At
tendants.

  Fort. Where is this sight?
  Hor. What is it you will see?
    If aught of woe or w
onder, cease your search.
  Fort. This quarry cries on havoc. O proud Death,
    What feast is tow
ard in thine eternal cell
    That thou so many princes at a shot
    So bloodily hast struck.
  
Ambassador. The sight is dismal;
    And our affairs from England come too late.
    The ears are 
senseless that should give us hearing
    To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd
    That Rosenc
rantz and Guildenstern are dead.
    Where should we have our thanks?
  Hor. Not from his mouth,

    Had it th' ability of life to thank you.
    He never gave commandment for their death.
    Bu
t since, so jump upon this bloody question,
    You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
  
  Are here arriv'd, give order that these bodies
    High on a stage be placed to the view;
    An
d let me speak to the yet unknowing world
    How these things came about. So shall you hear
    O
f carnal, bloody and unnatural acts;
    Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters;
    Of deaths
 put on by cunning and forc'd cause;
    And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
    Fall'n on th' i
nventors' heads. All this can I
    Truly deliver.
  Fort. Let us haste to hear it,
    And call 
the noblest to the audience.
    For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.
    I have some rights 
of memory in this kingdom
    Which now, to claim my vantage doth invite me.
  Hor. Of that I shal
l have also cause to speak,
    And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more.
    But let this
 same be presently perform'd,
    Even while men's minds are wild, lest more mischance
    On plot
s and errors happen.
  Fort. Let four captains
    Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage;
    F
or he was likely, had he been put on,
    To have prov'd most royally; and for his passage
    The
 soldiers' music and the rites of war
    Speak loudly for him.
    Take up the bodies. Such a sig
ht as this
    Becomes the field but here shows much amiss.
    Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
     
       Exeunt marching; after the which a peal of ordnance
                                        
           are shot off.

ACT I. Scene I.
E
lsinore. A platform before the Castle.

Enter two Sentinels-[first,] Francisco, [who paces up and 
down
at his post; then] Bernardo, [who approaches him].

  Ber. Who's there?
  Fran. Nay, answer
 me. Stand and unfold yourself.
  Ber. Long live the King!
  Fran. Bernardo?
  Ber. He.
  Fran. 
You come most carefully upon your hour.
  Ber. 'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.

  Fran. For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold,
    And I am sick at heart.
  Ber. Have yo
u had quiet guard?
  Fran. Not a mouse stirring.
  Ber. Well, good night.
    If you do meet Hora
tio and Marcellus,
    The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.

                    Enter Ho
ratio and Marcellus.

  Fran. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?
  Hor. Friends to thi
s ground.
  Mar. And liegemen to the Dane.
  Fran. Give you good night.
  Mar. O, farewell, hones
t soldier.
    Who hath reliev'd you?
  Fran. Bernardo hath my place.
    Give you good night.   
                                Exit.
  Mar. Holla, Bernardo!
  Ber. Say-
    What, is Horatio th
ere ?
  Hor. A piece of him.
  Ber. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.
  Mar. What, has t
his thing appear'd again to-night?
  Ber. I have seen nothing.
  Mar. Horatio says 'tis but our fa
ntasy,
    And will not let belief take hold of him
    Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of
 us.
    Therefore I have entreated him along,
    With us to watch the minutes of this night,
  
  That, if again this apparition come,
    He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
  Hor. Tush, t
ush, 'twill not appear.
  Ber. Sit down awhile,
    And let us once again assail your ears,
    T
hat are so fortified against our story,
    What we two nights have seen.
  Hor. Well, sit we down
,
    And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
  Ber. Last night of all,
    When yond same star t
hat's westward from the pole
    Had made his course t' illume that part of heaven
    Where now i
t burns, Marcellus and myself,
    The bell then beating one-

                        Enter Ghos
t.

  Mar. Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!
  Ber. In the same figure, like the 
King that's dead.
  Mar. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
  Ber. Looks it not like the Ki
ng? Mark it, Horatio.
  Hor. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.
  Ber. It would be spo
ke to.
  Mar. Question it, Horatio.
  Hor. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night
    Tog
ether with that fair and warlike form
    In which the majesty of buried Denmark
    Did sometimes
 march? By heaven I charge thee speak!
  Mar. It is offended.
  Ber. See, it stalks away!
  Hor. 
Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!
                                                     Exit 
Ghost.
  Mar. 'Tis gone and will not answer.
  Ber. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale.

    Is not this something more than fantasy?
    What think you on't?
  Hor. Before my God, I migh
t not this believe
    Without the sensible and true avouch
    Of mine own eyes.
  Mar. Is it no
t like the King?
  Hor. As thou art to thyself.
    Such was the very armour he had on
    When h
e th' ambitious Norway combated.
    So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,
    He smote the 
sledded Polacks on the ice.
    'Tis strange.
  Mar. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour
,
    With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
  Hor. In what particular thought to work I kn
ow not;
    But, in the gross and scope of my opinion,
    This bodes some strange eruption to our
 state.
  Mar. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows,
    Why this same strict and most ob
servant watch
    So nightly toils the subject of the land,
    And why such daily cast of brazen 
cannon
    And foreign mart for implements of war;
    Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore
 task
    Does not divide the Sunday from the week.
    What might be toward, that this sweaty has
te
    Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day?
    Who is't that can inform me?
  Hor. T
hat can I.
    At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
    Whose image even but now appear'd
 to us,
    Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
    Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pr
ide,
    Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet
    (For so this side of our known world
 esteem'd him)
    Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,
    Well ratified by law an
d heraldry,
    Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
    Which he stood seiz'd of, to t
he conqueror;
    Against the which a moiety competent
    Was gaged by our king; which had return
'd
    To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
    Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant
   
 And carriage of the article design'd,
    His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
    Of 
unimproved mettle hot and full,
    Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,
    Shark'd up a
 list of lawless resolutes,
    For food and diet, to some enterprise
    That hath a stomach in't
; which is no other,
    As it doth well appear unto our state,
    But to recover of us, by stron
g hand
    And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
    So by his father lost; and this, I tak
e it,
    Is the main motive of our preparations,
    The source of this our watch, and the chief 
head
    Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
  Ber. I think it be no other but e'en so.
  
  Well may it sort that this portentous figure
    Comes armed through our watch, so like the King

    That was and is the question of these wars.
  Hor. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
  
  In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
    A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
    The gr
aves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead
    Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;
    As
 stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood,
    Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
    Up
on whose influence Neptune's empire stands
    Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.
    And e
ven the like precurse of fierce events,
    As harbingers preceding still the fates
    And prolog
ue to the omen coming on,
    Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
    Unto our climature a
nd countrymen.

                      Enter Ghost again.

    But soft! behold! Lo, where it com
es again!
    I'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!
                                 
              Spreads his arms.
    If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
    Speak to me.
   
 If there be any good thing to be done,
    That may to thee do ease, and, race to me,
    Speak t
o me.
    If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
    Which happily foreknowing may avoid,
    O
, speak!
    Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
    Extorted treasure in the womb of earth
   
 (For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death),
                                            
     The cock crows.
    Speak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!
  Mar. Shall I strike 
at it with my partisan?
  Hor. Do, if it will not stand.
  Ber. 'Tis here!
  Hor. 'Tis here!
  M
ar. 'Tis gone!
                                                     Exit Ghost.
    We do it wrong
, being so majestical,
    To offer it the show of violence;
    For it is as the air, invulnerabl
e,
    And our vain blows malicious mockery.
  Ber. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
  
Hor. And then it started, like a guilty thing
    Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
    The coc
k, that is the trumpet to the morn,
    Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
    Awake t
he god of day; and at his warning,
    Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
    Th' extravagan
t and erring spirit hies
    To his confine; and of the truth herein
    This present object made 
probation.
  Mar. It faded on the crowing of the cock.
    Some say that ever, 'gainst that season
 comes
    Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
    The bird of dawning singeth all night lo
ng;
    And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,
    The nights are wholesome, then no plan
ets strike,
    No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
    So hallow'd and so gracious is 
the time.
  Hor. So have I heard and do in part believe it.
    But look, the morn, in russet mant
le clad,
    Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.
    Break we our watch up; and by my ad
vice
    Let us impart what we have seen to-night
    Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
    T
his spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
    Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
    A
s needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
    Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
    Wher
e we shall find him most conveniently.           Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A room of sta
te in the Castle.

Flourish. [Enter Claudius, King of Denmark, Gertrude the Queen,
Hamlet,
Polon
ius, Laertes and his sister Ophelia, [Voltemand, Cornelius,]
Lords Attendant.

  King. Though yet
 of Hamlet our dear brother's death
    The memory be green, and that it us befitted
    To bear o
ur hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom
    To be contracted in one brow of woe,
    Yet so far 
hath discretion fought with nature
    That we with wisest sorrow think on him
    Together with r
emembrance of ourselves.
    Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
    Th' imperial jointr
ess to this warlike state,
    Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,
    With an auspicious, and
 a dropping eye,
    With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,
    In equal scale weighin
g delight and dole,
    Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd
    Your better wisdoms, which ha
ve freely gone
    With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
    Now follows, that you know, yo
ung Fortinbras,
    Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
    Or thinking by our late dear brother
's death
    Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
    Colleagued with this dream of his adva
ntage,
    He hath not fail'd to pester us with message
    Importing the surrender of those lands

    Lost by his father, with all bands of law,
    To our most valiant brother. So much for him.

    Now for ourself and for this time of meeting.
    Thus much the business is: we have here writ

    To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,
    Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears
    Of th
is his nephew's purpose, to suppress
    His further gait herein, in that the levies,
    The list
s, and full proportions are all made
    Out of his subject; and we here dispatch
    You, good Co
rnelius, and you, Voltemand,
    For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,
    Giving to you no 
further personal power
    To business with the King, more than the scope
    Of these dilated art
icles allow.            [Gives a paper.]
    Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
  Cor
., Volt. In that, and all things, will we show our duty.
  King. We doubt it nothing. Heartily fare
well.
                                 Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius.
    And now, Laertes, what'
s the news with you?
    You told us of some suit. What is't, Laertes?
    You cannot speak of rea
son to the Dane
    And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
    That shall not be my 
offer, not thy asking?
    The head is not more native to the heart,
    The hand more instrumenta
l to the mouth,
    Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
    What wouldst thou have, Laert
es?
  Laer. My dread lord,
    Your leave and favour to return to France;
    From whence though 
willingly I came to Denmark
    To show my duty in your coronation,
    Yet now I must confess, th
at duty done,
    My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
    And bow them to your graciou
s leave and pardon.
  King. Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
  Pol. He hath, my l
ord, wrung from me my slow leave
    By laboursome petition, and at last
    Upon his will I seal'
d my hard consent.
    I do beseech you give him leave to go.
  King. Take thy fair hour, Laertes.
 Time be thine,
    And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
    But now, my cousin Hamlet, and m
y son-
  Ham. [aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind!
  King. How is it that the cloud
s still hang on you?
  Ham. Not so, my lord. I am too much i' th' sun.
  Queen. Good Hamlet, cast 
thy nighted colour off,
    And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
    Do not for ever w
ith thy vailed lids
    Seek for thy noble father in the dust.
    Thou know'st 'tis common. All t
hat lives must die,
    Passing through nature to eternity.
  Ham. Ay, madam, it is common.
  Que
en. If it be,
    Why seems it so particular with thee?
  Ham. Seems, madam, Nay, it is. I know no
t 'seems.'
    'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
    Nor customary suits of solemn black,

    Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,
    No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
    Nor t
he dejected havior of the visage,
    Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
    'That c
an denote me truly. These indeed seem,
    For they are actions that a man might play;
    But I h
ave that within which passeth show-
    These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
  King. 'Tis
 sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
    To give these mourning duties to your father;
 
   But you must know, your father lost a father;
    That father lost, lost his, and the survivor b
ound
    In filial obligation for some term
    To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever
    In o
bstinate condolement is a course
    Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief;
    It shows a w
ill most incorrect to heaven,
    A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
    An understanding simp
le and unschool'd;
    For what we know must be, and is as common
    As any the most vulgar thing
 to sense,
    Why should we in our peevish opposition
    Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to 
heaven,
    A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
    To reason most absurd, whose common t
heme
    Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
    From the first corse till he that died
 to-day,
    'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth
    This unprevailing woe, and think of
 us
    As of a father; for let the world take note
    You are the most immediate to our throne,

    And with no less nobility of love
    Than that which dearest father bears his son
    Do I i
mpart toward you. For your intent
    In going back to school in Wittenberg,
    It is most retrog
rade to our desire;
    And we beseech you, bend you to remain
    Here in the cheer and comfort o
f our eye,
    Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
  Queen. Let not thy mother lose her pr
ayers, Hamlet.
    I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.
  Ham. I shall in all my best o
bey you, madam.
  King. Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.
    Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, 
come.
    This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet
    Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof
,
    No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day
    But the great cannon to the clouds shall tel
l,
    And the King's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,
    Respeaking earthly thunder. Come awa
y.
                                Flourish. Exeunt all but Hamlet.
  Ham. O that this too too sol
id flesh would melt,
    Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!
    Or that the Everlasting had not 
fix'd
    His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
    How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitab
le
    Seem to me all the uses of this world!
    Fie on't! ah, fie! 'Tis an unweeded garden
    
That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
    Possess it merely. That it should come to t
his!
    But two months dead! Nay, not so much, not two.
    So excellent a king, that was to this

    Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
    That he might not beteem the winds of heaven

    Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
    Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him

    As if increase of appetite had grown
    By what it fed on; and yet, within a month-
    Let 
me not think on't! Frailty, thy name is woman!-
    A little month, or ere those shoes were old
  
  With which she followed my poor father's body
    Like Niobe, all tears- why she, even she
    (
O God! a beast that wants discourse of reason
    Would have mourn'd longer) married with my uncle;

    My father's brother, but no more like my father
    Than I to Hercules. Within a month,
    
Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
    Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
    She m
arried. O, most wicked speed, to post
    With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
    It is not,
 nor it cannot come to good.
    But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue!

          Enter 
Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo.

  Hor. Hail to your lordship!
  Ham. I am glad to see you well
.
    Horatio!- or I do forget myself.
  Hor. The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
  Ha
m. Sir, my good friend- I'll change that name with you.
    And what make you from Wittenberg, Hora
tio?
    Marcellus?
  Mar. My good lord!
  Ham. I am very glad to see you.- [To Bernardo] Good ev
en, sir.-

    But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
  Hor. A truant disposition, good my
 lord.
  Ham. I would not hear your enemy say so,
    Nor shall you do my ear that violence
    T
o make it truster of your own report
    Against yourself. I know you are no truant.
    But what 
is your affair in Elsinore?
    We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
  Hor. My lord, I ca
me to see your father's funeral.
  Ham. I prithee do not mock me, fellow student.
    I think it w
as to see my mother's wedding.
  Hor. Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.
  Ham. Thrift, thrif
t, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats
    Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
    Would I 
had met my dearest foe in heaven
    Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
    My father- methinks
 I see my father.
  Hor. O, where, my lord?
  Ham. In my mind's eye, Horatio.
  Hor. I saw him on
ce. He was a goodly king.
  Ham. He was a man, take him for all in all.
    I shall not look upon 
his like again.
  Hor. My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
  Ham. Saw? who?
  Hor. My lord, t
he King your father.
  Ham. The King my father?
  Hor. Season your admiration for a while
    Wit
h an attent ear, till I may deliver
    Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
    This marvel to yo
u.
  Ham. For God's love let me hear!
  Hor. Two nights together had these gentlemen
    (Marcell
us and Bernardo) on their watch
    In the dead vast and middle of the night
    Been thus encount
'red. A figure like your father,
    Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
    Appears before them and
 with solemn march
    Goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walk'd
    By their oppress'd and 
fear-surprised eyes,
    Within his truncheon's length; whilst they distill'd
    Almost to jelly 
with the act of fear,
    Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
    In dreadful secrecy impa
rt they did,
    And I with them the third night kept the watch;
    Where, as they had deliver'd,
 both in time,
    Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
    The apparition comes. I kn
ew your father.
    These hands are not more like.
  Ham. But where was this?
  Mar. My lord, upo
n the platform where we watch'd.
  Ham. Did you not speak to it?
  Hor. My lord, I did;
    But a
nswer made it none. Yet once methought
    It lifted up it head and did address
    Itself to moti
on, like as it would speak;
    But even then the morning cock crew loud,
    And at the sound it 
shrunk in haste away
    And vanish'd from our sight.
  Ham. 'Tis very strange.
  Hor. As I do li
ve, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
    And we did think it writ down in our duty
    To let you know
 of it.
  Ham. Indeed, indeed, sirs. But this troubles me.
    Hold you the watch to-night?
  Bot
h [Mar. and Ber.] We do, my lord.
  Ham. Arm'd, say you?
  Both. Arm'd, my lord.
  Ham. From top 
to toe?
  Both. My lord, from head to foot.
  Ham. Then saw you not his face?
  Hor. O, yes, my l
ord! He wore his beaver up.
  Ham. What, look'd he frowningly.
  Hor. A countenance more in sorrow
 than in anger.
  Ham. Pale or red?
  Hor. Nay, very pale.
  Ham. And fix'd his eyes upon you?
 
 Hor. Most constantly.
  Ham. I would I had been there.
  Hor. It would have much amaz'd you.
  H
am. Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
  Hor. While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred
.
  Both. Longer, longer.
  Hor. Not when I saw't.
  Ham. His beard was grizzled- no?
  Hor. It 
was, as I have seen it in his life,
    A sable silver'd.
  Ham. I will watch to-night.
    Perch
ance 'twill walk again.
  Hor. I warr'nt it will.
  Ham. If it assume my noble father's person,
 
   I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
    And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,

    If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
    Let it be tenable in your silence still;
    An
d whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
    Give it an understanding but no tongue.
    I will requi
te your loves. So, fare you well.
    Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
    I'll visit 
you.
  All. Our duty to your honour.
  Ham. Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell.
               
                         Exeunt [all but Hamlet].
    My father's spirit- in arms? All is not well.

    I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come!
    Till then sit still, my soul. Foul dee
ds will rise,
    Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
Exit.




Scene III.
E
lsinore. A room in the house of Polonius.

Enter Laertes and Ophelia.

  Laer. My necessaries ar
e embark'd. Farewell.
    And, sister, as the winds give benefit
    And convoy is assistant, do n
ot sleep,
    But let me hear from you.
  Oph. Do you doubt that?
  Laer. For Hamlet, and the tri
fling of his favour,
    Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood;
    A violet in the youth of primy
 nature,
    Forward, not permanent- sweet, not lasting;
    The perfume and suppliance of a minut
e;
    No more.
  Oph. No more but so?
  Laer. Think it no more.
    For nature crescent does no
t grow alone
    In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,
    The inward service of the mind a
nd soul
    Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
    And now no soil nor cautel doth besmi
rch
    The virtue of his will; but you must fear,
    His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his 
own;
    For he himself is subject to his birth.
    He may not, as unvalued persons do,
    Carv
e for himself, for on his choice depends
    The safety and health of this whole state,
    And th
erefore must his choice be circumscrib'd
    Unto the voice and yielding of that body
    Whereof 
he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
    It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
    As 
he in his particular act and place
    May give his saying deed; which is no further
    Than the 
main voice of Denmark goes withal.
    Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain
    If with to
o credent ear you list his songs,
    Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
    To his 
unmast'red importunity.
    Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
    And keep you in the rea
r of your affection,
    Out of the shot and danger of desire.
    The chariest maid is prodigal e
nough
    If she unmask her beauty to the moon.
    Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes.

    The canker galls the infants of the spring
    Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd,
    
And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
    Contagious blastments are most imminent.
    Be wary t
hen; best safety lies in fear.
    Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
  Oph. I shall t
h' effect of this good lesson keep
    As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
    Do not a
s some ungracious pastors do,
    Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven,
    Whiles, like a p
uff'd and reckless libertine,
    Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads
    And recks not 
his own rede.
  Laer. O, fear me not!

                       Enter Polonius.

    I stay too l
ong. But here my father comes.
    A double blessing is a double grace;
    Occasion smiles upon a
 second leave.
  Pol. Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame!
    The wind sits in the shoul
der of your sail,
    And you are stay'd for. There- my blessing with thee!
    And these few prec
epts in thy memory
    Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
    Nor any unproportion'
d thought his act.
    Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar:
    Those friends thou hast, and 
their adoption tried,
    Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel;
    But do not dull thy 
palm with entertainment
    Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware
    Of entrance to a qu
arrel; but being in,
    Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee.
    Give every man thine ear,
 but few thy voice;
    Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
    Costly thy habit as
 thy purse can buy,
    But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
    For the apparel oft procl
aims the man,
    And they in France of the best rank and station
    Are most select and generous
, chief in that.
    Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
    For loan oft loses both itself and fr
iend,
    And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
    This above all- to thine own self be true
,
    And it must follow, as the night the day,
    Thou canst not then be false to any man.
    
Farewell. My blessing season this in thee!
  Laer. Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
  Pol.
 The time invites you. Go, your servants tend.
  Laer. Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well
    Wh
at I have said to you.
  Oph. 'Tis in my memory lock'd,
    And you yourself shall keep the key of
 it.
  Laer. Farewell.                                          Exit.
  Pol. What is't, Ophelia, h
e hath said to you?
  Oph. So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
  Pol. Marry, well b
ethought!
    'Tis told me he hath very oft of late
    Given private time to you, and you yoursel
f
    Have of your audience been most free and bounteous.
    If it be so- as so 'tis put on me,

    And that in way of caution- I must tell you
    You do not understand yourself so clearly
    
As it behooves my daughter and your honour.
    What is between you? Give me up the truth.
  Oph. 
He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
    Of his affection to me.
  Pol. Affection? Pooh! Yo
u speak like a green girl,
    Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
    Do you believe his tend
ers, as you call them?
  Oph. I do not know, my lord, what I should think,
  Pol. Marry, I will te
ach you! Think yourself a baby
    That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
    Which are n
ot sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,
    Or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
    Ru
nning it thus) you'll tender me a fool.
  Oph. My lord, he hath importun'd me with love
    In hon
ourable fashion.
  Pol. Ay, fashion you may call it. Go to, go to!
  Oph. And hath given countenan
ce to his speech, my lord,
    With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
  Pol. Ay, springes to cat
ch woodcocks! I do know,
    When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
    Lends the tongue vows
. These blazes, daughter,
    Giving more light than heat, extinct in both
    Even in their promi
se, as it is a-making,
    You must not take for fire. From this time
    Be something scanter of 
your maiden presence.
    Set your entreatments at a higher rate
    Than a command to parley. For
 Lord Hamlet,
    Believe so much in him, that he is young,
    And with a larger tether may he wa
lk
    Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia,
    Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,

    Not of that dye which their investments show,
    But mere implorators of unholy suits,
    B
reathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
    The better to beguile. This is for all:
    I would 
not, in plain terms, from this time forth
    Have you so slander any moment leisure
    As to giv
e words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
    Look to't, I charge you. Come your ways.
  Oph. I shall 
obey, my lord.
                                                         Exeunt.




Scene IV.

Elsinore. The platform before the Castle.

Enter Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus.

  Ham. The ai
r bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
  Hor. It is a nipping and an eager air.
  Ham. What hour now?

  Hor. I think it lacks of twelve.
  Mar. No, it is struck.
  Hor. Indeed? I heard it not. It the
n draws near the season
    Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
                   A flouris
h of trumpets, and two pieces go off.
    What does this mean, my lord?
  Ham. The King doth wake 
to-night and takes his rouse,
    Keeps wassail, and the swagg'ring upspring reels,
    And, as he
 drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
    The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out
    The triumph
 of his pledge.
  Hor. Is it a custom?
  Ham. Ay, marry, is't;
    But to my mind, though I am na
tive here
    And to the manner born, it is a custom
    More honour'd in the breach than the obse
rvance.
    This heavy-headed revel east and west
    Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations
;
    They clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase
    Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
 
   From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
    The pith and marrow of our attribute.
  
  So oft it chances in particular men
    That, for some vicious mole of nature in them,
    As in
 their birth,- wherein they are not guilty,
    Since nature cannot choose his origin,-
    By the
 o'ergrowth of some complexion,
    Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
    Or by som
e habit that too much o'erleavens
    The form of plausive manners, that these men
    Carrying, I
 say, the stamp of one defect,
    Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,
    Their virtues els
e- be they as pure as grace,
    As infinite as man may undergo-
    Shall in the general censure 
take corruption
    From that particular fault. The dram of e'il
    Doth all the noble substance 
often dout To his own scandal.

                         Enter Ghost.

  Hor. Look, my lord, it 
comes!
  Ham. Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
    Be thou a spirit of health or goblin da
mn'd,
    Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
    Be thy intents wicked or chari
table,
    Thou com'st in such a questionable shape
    That I will speak to thee. I'll call thee 
Hamlet,
    King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me?
    Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell
 
   Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,
    Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre
  
  Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
    Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws
    To cast the
e up again. What may this mean
    That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,
    Revisits th
us the glimpses of the moon,
    Making night hideous, and we fools of nature
    So horridly to s
hake our disposition
    With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
    Say, why is this? wher
efore? What should we do?
                                           Ghost beckons Hamlet.
  Hor. 
It beckons you to go away with it,
    As if it some impartment did desire
    To you alone.
  Ma
r. Look with what courteous action
    It waves you to a more removed ground.
    But do not go wi
th it!
  Hor. No, by no means!
  Ham. It will not speak. Then will I follow it.
  Hor. Do not, my
 lord!
  Ham. Why, what should be the fear?
    I do not set my life at a pin's fee;
    And for 
my soul, what can it do to that,
    Being a thing immortal as itself?
    It waves me forth again
. I'll follow it.
  Hor. What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
    Or to the dreadful su
mmit of the cliff
    That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
    And there assume some other, ho
rrible form
    Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
    And draw you into madness? Thin
k of it.
    The very place puts toys of desperation,
    Without more motive, into every brain
 
   That looks so many fadoms to the sea
    And hears it roar beneath.
  Ham. It waves me still.

    Go on. I'll follow thee.
  Mar. You shall not go, my lord.
  Ham. Hold off your hands!
  Hor.
 Be rul'd. You shall not go.
  Ham. My fate cries out
    And makes each petty artire in this body

    As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
                                                [Ghost b
eckons.]

    Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
    By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him th
at lets me!-
    I say, away!- Go on. I'll follow thee.
                                        Ex
eunt Ghost and Hamlet.
  Hor. He waxes desperate with imagination.
  Mar. Let's follow. 'Tis not f
it thus to obey him.
  Hor. Have after. To what issue will this come?
  Mar. Something is rotten i
n the state of Denmark.
  Hor. Heaven will direct it.
  Mar. Nay, let's follow him.
             
                                            Exeunt.




Scene V.
Elsinore. The Castle. Another
 part of the fortifications.

Enter Ghost and Hamlet.

  Ham. Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak! 
I'll go no further.
  Ghost. Mark me.
  Ham. I will.
  Ghost. My hour is almost come,
    When I
 to sulph'rous and tormenting flames
    Must render up myself.
  Ham. Alas, poor ghost!
  Ghost.
 Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
    To what I shall unfold.
  Ham. Speak. I am bound to
 hear.
  Ghost. So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
  Ham. What?
  Ghost. I am thy fath
er's spirit,
    Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
    And for the day confin'd to fast
 in fires,
    Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
    Are burnt and purg'd away. But t
hat I am forbid
    To tell the secrets of my prison house,
    I could a tale unfold whose lighte
st word
    Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
    Make thy two eyes, like stars, s
tart from their spheres,
    Thy knotted and combined locks to part,
    And each particular hair 
to stand on end
    Like quills upon the fretful porcupine.
    But this eternal blazon must not b
e
    To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
    If thou didst ever thy dear father love
-
  Ham. O God!
  Ghost. Revenge his foul and most unnatural murther.
  Ham. Murther?
  Ghost. M
urther most foul, as in the best it is;
    But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.
  Ham. Has
te me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
    As meditation or the thoughts of love,
    May sw
eep to my revenge.
  Ghost. I find thee apt;
    And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
  
  That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
    Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.
 
   'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
    A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark

    Is by a forged process of my death
    Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth,
    The se
rpent that did sting thy father's life
    Now wears his crown.
  Ham. O my prophetic soul!
    M
y uncle?
  Ghost. Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
    With witchcraft of his wit, with
 traitorous gifts-
    O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
    So to seduce!- won to his s
hameful lust
    The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.
    O Hamlet, what a falling-off was 
there,
    From me, whose love was of that dignity
    That it went hand in hand even with the vow

    I made to her in marriage, and to decline
    Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
  
  To those of mine!
    But virtue, as it never will be mov'd,
    Though lewdness court it in a s
hape of heaven,
    So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
    Will sate itself in a celestial
 bed
    And prey on garbage.
    But soft! methinks I scent the morning air.
    Brief let me be
. Sleeping within my orchard,
    My custom always of the afternoon,
    Upon my secure hour thy u
ncle stole,
    With juice of cursed hebona in a vial,
    And in the porches of my ears did pour

    The leperous distilment; whose effect
    Holds such an enmity with blood of man
    That swi
ft as quicksilver it courses through
    The natural gates and alleys of the body,
    And with a 
sudden vigour it doth posset
    And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
    The thin and wholes
ome blood. So did it mine;
    And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
    Most lazar-like, with v
ile and loathsome crust
    All my smooth body.
    Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
   
 Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd;
    Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
    
Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd,
    No reckoning made, but sent to my account
    With all my 
imperfections on my head.
  Ham. O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
  Ghost. If thou hast na
ture in thee, bear it not.
    Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
    A couch for luxury and damn
ed incest.
    But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
    Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul con
trive
    Against thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven,
    And to those thorns that in her bosom
 lodge
    To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once.
    The glowworm shows the matin to be 
near
    And gins to pale his uneffectual fire.
    Adieu, adieu, adieu! Remember me.             
         Exit.

  Ham. O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?
    And shall I couple hell?
 Hold, hold, my heart!
    And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
    But bear me stiffly up. R
emember thee?
    Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
    In this distracted globe. Rem
ember thee?
    Yea, from the table of my memory
    I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
   
 All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past
    That youth and observation copied there,
   
 And thy commandment all alone shall live
    Within the book and volume of my brain,
    Unmix'd 
with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!
    O most pernicious woman!
    O villain, villain, smiling, d
amned villain!
    My tables! Meet it is I set it down
    That one may smile, and smile, and be a
 villain;
    At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark.        [Writes.]
    So, uncle, there yo
u are. Now to my word:
    It is 'Adieu, adieu! Remember me.'
    I have sworn't.
  Hor. (within)
 My lord, my lord!

                   Enter Horatio and Marcellus.

  Mar. Lord Hamlet!
  Hor.
 Heaven secure him!
  Ham. So be it!
  Mar. Illo, ho, ho, my lord!
  Ham. Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Com
e, bird, come.
  Mar. How is't, my noble lord?
  Hor. What news, my lord?
  Mar. O, wonderful!
 
 Hor. Good my lord, tell it.
  Ham. No, you will reveal it.
  Hor. Not I, my lord, by heaven!
  M
ar. Nor I, my lord.
  Ham. How say you then? Would heart of man once think it?
    But you'll be s
ecret?
  Both. Ay, by heaven, my lord.
  Ham. There's neer a villain dwelling in all Denmark
    
But he's an arrant knave.
  Hor. There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
    To tell us
 this.
  Ham. Why, right! You are in the right!
    And so, without more circumstance at all,
   
 I hold it fit that we shake hands and part;
    You, as your business and desires shall point you,

    For every man hath business and desire,
    Such as it is; and for my own poor part,
    Loo
k you, I'll go pray.
  Hor. These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
  Ham. I am sorry they
 offend you, heartily;
    Yes, faith, heartily.
  Hor. There's no offence, my lord.
  Ham. Yes, 
by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
    And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
    
It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.
    For your desire to know what is between us,
    O
'ermaster't as you may. And now, good friends,
    As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,
   
 Give me one poor request.
  Hor. What is't, my lord? We will.
  Ham. Never make known what you ha
ve seen to-night.
  Both. My lord, we will not.
  Ham. Nay, but swear't.
  Hor. In faith,
    My
 lord, not I.
  Mar. Nor I, my lord- in faith.
  Ham. Upon my sword.
  Mar. We have sworn, my lor
d, already.
  Ham. Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.

                 Ghost cries under the stage.


  Ghost. Swear.
  Ham. Aha boy, say'st thou so? Art thou there, truepenny?
    Come on! You hea
r this fellow in the cellarage.
    Consent to swear.
  Hor. Propose the oath, my lord.
  Ham. Ne
ver to speak of this that you have seen.
    Swear by my sword.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
  Ham. 
Hic et ubique? Then we'll shift our ground.
    Come hither, gentlemen,
    And lay your hands aga
in upon my sword.
    Never to speak of this that you have heard:
    Swear by my sword.
  Ghost.
 [beneath] Swear by his sword.
  Ham. Well said, old mole! Canst work i' th' earth so fast?
    A 
worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends."
  Hor. O day and night, but this is wondrous strang
e!
  Ham. And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
    There are more things in heaven and ear
th, Horatio,
    Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
    But come!
    Here, as before, never,
 so help you mercy,
    How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself
    (As I perchance hereafter shal
l think meet
    To put an antic disposition on),
    That you, at such times seeing me, never sha
ll,
    With arms encumb'red thus, or this head-shake,
    Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phra
se,
    As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'
    Or 'If we list to speak,' or 
'There be, an if they might,'
    Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
    That you know aught of
 me- this is not to do,
    So grace and mercy at your most need help you,
    Swear.
  Ghost. [b
eneath] Swear.
                                                   [They swear.]
  Ham. Rest, rest,
 perturbed spirit! So, gentlemen,
    With all my love I do commend me to you;
    And what so poo
r a man as Hamlet is
    May do t' express his love and friending to you,
    God willing, shall n
ot lack. Let us go in together;
    And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
    The time is o
ut of joint. O cursed spite
    That ever I was born to set it right!
    Nay, come, let's go toge
ther.
                                                         Exeunt.

Act II.
 Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius.

Enter Polonius and Reynaldo.

  Pol. Give
 him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
  Rey. I will, my lord.
  Pol. You shall do marvell's w
isely, good Reynaldo,
    Before You visit him, to make inquire
    Of his behaviour.
  Rey. My l
ord, I did intend it.
  Pol. Marry, well said, very well said. Look you, sir,
    Enquire me first
 what Danskers are in Paris;
    And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
    What compa
ny, at what expense; and finding
    By this encompassment and drift of question
    That they do 
know my son, come you more nearer
    Than your particular demands will touch it.
    Take you, as
 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
    As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
    And i
n part him.' Do you mark this, Reynaldo?
  Rey. Ay, very well, my lord.
  Pol. 'And in part him, b
ut,' you may say, 'not well.
    But if't be he I mean, he's very wild
    Addicted so and so'; an
d there put on him
    What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
    As may dishonour him- ta
ke heed of that;
    But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips
    As are companions noted and 
most known
    To youth and liberty.
  Rey. As gaming, my lord.
  Pol. Ay, or drinking, fencing, 
swearing, quarrelling,
    Drabbing. You may go so far.
  Rey. My lord, that would dishonour him.

  Pol. Faith, no, as you may season it in the charge.
    You must not put another scandal on him,

    That he is open to incontinency.
    That's not my meaning. But breathe his faults so quaintl
y
    That they may seem the taints of liberty,
    The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
    A
 savageness in unreclaimed blood,
    Of general assault.
  Rey. But, my good lord-
  Pol. Wheref
ore should you do this?
  Rey. Ay, my lord,
    I would know that.
  Pol. Marry, sir, here's my d
rift,
    And I believe it is a fetch of warrant.
    You laying these slight sullies on my son
 
   As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' th' working,
    Mark you,
    Your party in converse, him
 you would sound,
    Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
    The youth you breathe of guil
ty, be assur'd
    He closes with you in this consequence:
    'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 
'gentleman'-
    According to the phrase or the addition
    Of man and country-
  Rey. Very good
, my lord.
  Pol. And then, sir, does 'a this- 'a does- What was I about to
say?
    By the mass,
 I was about to say something! Where did I leave?
  Rey. At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend
 or so,' and
    gentleman.'
  Pol. At 'closes in the consequence'- Ay, marry!
    He closes thus
: 'I know the gentleman.
    I saw him yesterday, or t'other day,
    Or then, or then, with such 
or such; and, as you say,
    There was 'a gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
    There falling ou
t at tennis'; or perchance,
    'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'
    Videlicet, a brothel, 
or so forth.
    See you now-
    Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth;
    And thus d
o we of wisdom and of reach,
    With windlasses and with assays of bias,
    By indirections find
 directions out.
    So, by my former lecture and advice,
    Shall you my son. You have me, have 
you not?
  Rey. My lord, I have.
  Pol. God b' wi' ye, fare ye well!
  Rey. Good my lord!        
                            [Going.]
  Pol. Observe his inclination in yourself.
  Rey. I shall, m
y lord.
  Pol. And let him ply his music.
  Rey. Well, my lord.
  Pol. Farewell!
               
                                   Exit Reynaldo.

                       Enter Ophelia.

    Ho
w now, Ophelia? What's the matter?
  Oph. O my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
  Pol. Wi
th what, i' th' name of God?
  Oph. My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
    Lord Hamlet, with h
is doublet all unbrac'd,
    No hat upon his head, his stockings foul'd,
    Ungart'red, and down-
gyved to his ankle;
    Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,
    And with a look so p
iteous in purport
    As if he had been loosed out of hell
    To speak of horrors- he comes befor
e me.
  Pol. Mad for thy love?
  Oph. My lord, I do not know,
    But truly I do fear it.
  Pol.
 What said he?
  Oph. He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
    Then goes he to the length of 
all his arm,
    And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
    He falls to such perusal of my f
ace
    As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so.
    At last, a little shaking of mine arm,
    An
d thrice his head thus waving up and down,
    He rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound
    As it 
did seem to shatter all his bulk
    And end his being. That done, he lets me go,
    And with his
 head over his shoulder turn'd
    He seem'd to find his way without his eyes,
    For out o' door
s he went without their help
    And to the last bended their light on me.
  Pol. Come, go with me
. I will go seek the King.
    This is the very ecstasy of love,
    Whose violent property fordoe
s itself
    And leads the will to desperate undertakings
    As oft as any passion under heaven

    That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
    What, have you given him any hard words of late?

  Oph. No, my good lord; but, as you did command,
    I did repel his letters and denied
    His
 access to me.
  Pol. That hath made him mad.
    I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
 
   I had not quoted him. I fear'd he did but trifle
    And meant to wrack thee; but beshrew my jea
lousy!
    By heaven, it is as proper to our age
    To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
   
 As it is common for the younger sort
    To lack discretion. Come, go we to the King.
    This mu
st be known; which, being kept close, might move
    More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
 
   Come.
                                                         Exeunt.

Scene II.
Elsinore. A
 room in the Castle.

Flourish. [Enter King and Queen, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern,
cum aliis.


  King. Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
    Moreover that we much did long to see you
,
    The need we have to use you did provoke
    Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
   
 Of Hamlet's transformation. So I call it,
    Sith nor th' exterior nor the inward man
    Resemb
les that it was. What it should be,
    More than his father's death, that thus hath put him
    S
o much from th' understanding of himself,
    I cannot dream of. I entreat you both
    That, bein
g of so young days brought up with him,
    And since so neighbour'd to his youth and haviour,
   
 That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
    Some little time; so by your companies
    To 
draw him on to pleasures, and to gather
    So much as from occasion you may glean,
    Whether au
ght to us unknown afflicts him thus
    That, open'd, lies within our remedy.
  Queen. Good gentle
men, he hath much talk'd of you,
    And sure I am two men there are not living
    To whom he mor
e adheres. If it will please you
    To show us so much gentry and good will
    As to expend your
 time with us awhile
    For the supply and profit of our hope,
    Your visitation shall receive 
such thanks
    As fits a king's remembrance.
  Ros. Both your Majesties
    Might, by the sovere
ign power you have of us,
    Put your dread pleasures more into command
    Than to entreaty.
  
Guil. But we both obey,
    And here give up ourselves, in the full bent,
    To lay our service f
reely at your feet,
    To be commanded.
  King. Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
  Q
ueen. Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz.
    And I beseech you instantly to visit
    My
 too much changed son.- Go, some of you,
    And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
  Guil. He
avens make our presence and our practices
    Pleasant and helpful to him!
  Queen. Ay, amen!
   
              Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, [with some
                                     
               Attendants].

                         Enter Polonius.

  Pol. Th' ambassadors fr
om Norway, my good lord,
    Are joyfully return'd.
  King. Thou still hast been the father of goo
d news.
  Pol. Have I, my lord? Assure you, my good liege,
    I hold my duty as I hold my soul,

    Both to my God and to my gracious king;
    And I do think- or else this brain of mine
    Hun
ts not the trail of policy so sure
    As it hath us'd to do- that I have found
    The very cause
 of Hamlet's lunacy.
  King. O, speak of that! That do I long to hear.
  Pol. Give first admittanc
e to th' ambassadors.
    My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
  King. Thyself do grace
 to them, and bring them in.
                                                [Exit Polonius.]
    
He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found
    The head and source of all your son's distemper.

  Queen. I doubt it is no other but the main,
    His father's death and our o'erhasty marriage.
 
 King. Well, we shall sift him.

              Enter Polonius, Voltemand, and Cornelius.

    We
lcome, my good friends.
    Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?
  Volt. Most fair return
 of greetings and desires.
    Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
    His nephew's levies; wh
ich to him appear'd
    To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack,
    But better look'd into, he tru
ly found
    It was against your Highness; whereat griev'd,
    That so his sickness, age, and imp
otence
    Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
    On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obe
ys,
    Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,
    Makes vow before his uncle never more
    
To give th' assay of arms against your Majesty.
    Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
    Giv
es him three thousand crowns in annual fee
    And his commission to employ those soldiers,
    So
 levied as before, against the Polack;
    With an entreaty, herein further shown,
               
                                 [Gives a paper.]
    That it might please you to give quiet pass

    Through your dominions for this enterprise,
    On such regards of safety and allowance
    As
 therein are set down.
  King. It likes us well;
    And at our more consider'd time we'll read,

    Answer, and think upon this business.
    Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour.
   
 Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together.
    Most welcome home!                       Exeun
t Ambassadors.
  Pol. This business is well ended.
    My liege, and madam, to expostulate
    Wh
at majesty should be, what duty is,
    Why day is day, night is night, and time is time.
    Were
 nothing but to waste night, day, and time.
    Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
    A
nd tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
    I will be brief. Your noble son is mad.
    M
ad call I it; for, to define true madness,
    What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
    But l
et that go.
  Queen. More matter, with less art.
  Pol. Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
    T
hat he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
    And pity 'tis 'tis true. A foolish figure!
    
But farewell it, for I will use no art.
    Mad let us grant him then. And now remains
    That we
 find out the cause of this effect-
    Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
    For this effe
ct defective comes by cause.
    Thus it remains, and the remainder thus.
    Perpend.
    I have
 a daughter (have while she is mine),
    Who in her duty and obedience, mark,
    Hath given me t
his. Now gather, and surmise.
                                             [Reads] the letter.
   
 'To the celestial, and my soul's idol, the most beautified
      Ophelia,'-

    That's an ill p
hrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is a vile
      phrase.
    But you shall hear. Thus:
        
                                                [Reads.]
    'In her excellent white bosom, these, 
&c.'
  Queen. Came this from Hamlet to her?
  Pol. Good madam, stay awhile. I will be faithful.   
  [Reads.]


          'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
            Doubt that the sun doth move;

          Doubt truth to be a liar;
            But never doubt I love.
      'O dear Ophelia, I
 am ill at these numbers; I have not art
to
    reckon my groans; but that I love thee best, O mos
t best,
believe
    it. Adieu.
      'Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to

him,

HAMLET.'

    This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me;
    And more above, hath his
 solicitings,
    As they fell out by time, by means, and place,
    All given to mine ear.
  Kin
g. But how hath she
    Receiv'd his love?
  Pol. What do you think of me?
  King. As of a man fa
ithful and honourable.
  Pol. I would fain prove so. But what might you think,
    When I had seen
 this hot love on the wing
    (As I perceiv'd it, I must tell you that,
    Before my daughter to
ld me), what might you,
    Or my dear Majesty your queen here, think,
    If I had play'd the des
k or table book,
    Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
    Or look'd upon this love with
 idle sight?
    What might you think? No, I went round to work
    And my young mistress thus I d
id bespeak:
    'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star.
    This must not be.' And then I presc
ripts gave her,
    That she should lock herself from his resort,
    Admit no messengers, receive
 no tokens.
    Which done, she took the fruits of my advice,
    And he, repulsed, a short tale t
o make,
    Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
    Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,

    Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
    Into the madness wherein now he raves,
  
  And all we mourn for.
  King. Do you think 'tis this?
  Queen. it may be, very like.
  Pol. Hat
h there been such a time- I would fain know that-
    That I have Positively said ''Tis so,'
    W
hen it prov'd otherwise.?
  King. Not that I know.
  Pol. [points to his head and shoulder] Take t
his from this, if
this
      be otherwise.
    If circumstances lead me, I will find
    Where t
ruth is hid, though it were hid indeed
    Within the centre.
  King. How may we try it further?

  Pol. You know sometimes he walks for hours together
    Here in the lobby.
  Queen. So he does i
ndeed.
  Pol. At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him.
    Be you and I behind an arras then.

    Mark the encounter. If he love her not,
    And he not from his reason fall'n thereon
    Le
t me be no assistant for a state,
    But keep a farm and carters.
  King. We will try it.

    
             Enter Hamlet, reading on a book.

  Queen. But look where sadly the poor wretch comes
 reading.
  Pol. Away, I do beseech you, both away
    I'll board him presently. O, give me leave.

                       Exeunt King and Queen, [with Attendants].
    How does my good Lord Hamlet
?
  Ham. Well, God-a-mercy.
  Pol. Do you know me, my lord?
  Ham. Excellent well. You are a fish
monger.
  Pol. Not I, my lord.
  Ham. Then I would you were so honest a man.
  Pol. Honest, my lo
rd?
  Ham. Ay, sir. To be honest, as this world goes, is to be one
man
    pick'd out of ten thou
sand.
  Pol. That's very true, my lord.
  Ham. For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a
 god
    kissing carrion- Have you a daughter?
  Pol. I have, my lord.
  Ham. Let her not walk i'
 th' sun. Conception is a blessing, but
not
    as your daughter may conceive. Friend, look to't.

  Pol. [aside] How say you by that? Still harping on my daughter.
Yet
    he knew me not at first
. He said I was a fishmonger. He is
far
    gone, far gone! And truly in my youth I suff'red much

extremity
    for love- very near this. I'll speak to him again.- What do
you
    read, my lord?

  Ham. Words, words, words.
  Pol. What is the matter, my lord?
  Ham. Between who?
  Pol. I me
an, the matter that you read, my lord.
  Ham. Slanders, sir; for the satirical rogue says here that
 old
men
    have grey beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes
    purging thick amber 
and plum-tree gum; and that they have a
    plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams. Al
l
which,
    sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I
hold it
    not honesty t
o have it thus set down; for you yourself, sir,
    should be old as I am if, like a crab, you coul
d go backward.

  Pol. [aside] Though this be madness, yet there is a method
in't.-
   Will You 
walk out of the air, my lord?
  Ham. Into my grave?
  Pol. Indeed, that is out o' th' air. [Aside]
 How pregnant
sometimes
    his replies are! a happiness that often madness hits on,
which
    r
eason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of.
I
    will leave him and suddenly cont
rive the means of meeting
between
    him and my daughter.- My honourable lord, I will most humbly

take
    my leave of you.
  Ham. You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more
    wi
llingly part withal- except my life, except my life, except
my
    life,

                    En
ter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Pol. Fare you well, my lord.
  Ham. These tedious old fools!

  Pol. You go to seek the Lord Hamlet. There he is.
  Ros. [to Polonius] God save you, sir!
    
                                            Exit [Polonius].

  Guil. My honour'd lord!
  Ros. My
 most dear lord!
  Ham. My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern?
Ah,
    Rosencran
tz! Good lads, how do ye both?
  Ros. As the indifferent children of the earth.
  Guil. Happy in t
hat we are not over-happy.
    On Fortune's cap we are not the very button.
  Ham. Nor the soles o
f her shoe?
  Ros. Neither, my lord.
  Ham. Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her

    favours?
  Guil. Faith, her privates we.
  Ham. In the secret parts of Fortune? O! most true
! she is a
    strumpet. What news ?
  Ros. None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
  H
am. Then is doomsday near! But your news is not true. Let me
    question more in particular. What 
have you, my good friends,
    deserved at the hands of Fortune that she sends you to prison
    h
ither?
  Guil. Prison, my lord?
  Ham. Denmark's a prison.
  Ros. Then is the world one.
  Ham. 
A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and
    dungeons, Denmark being one o' th' w
orst.
  Ros. We think not so, my lord.
  Ham. Why, then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing eit
her
good
    or bad but thinking makes it so. To me it is a prison.
  Ros. Why, then your ambitio
n makes it one. 'Tis too narrow for
your
    mind.
  Ham. O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell
 and count myself a
    king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.
  Guil. Which 
dreams indeed are ambition; for the very substance
of
    the ambitious is merely the shadow of a 
dream.
  Ham. A dream itself is but a shadow.
  Ros. Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and lig
ht a quality
that
    it is but a shadow's shadow.
  Ham. Then are our beggars bodies, and our mo
narchs and
outstretch'd
    heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we to th' court? for, by
my
    f
ay, I cannot reason.
  Both. We'll wait upon you.
  Ham. No such matter! I will not sort you with 
the rest of my
    servants; for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most
    dreadfully att
ended. But in the beaten way of friendship,
what
    make you at Elsinore?
  Ros. To visit you, m
y lord; no other occasion.
  Ham. Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank
you;
  
  and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny.
Were
    you not sent for? Is it you
r own inclining? Is it a free
    visitation? Come, deal justly with me. Come, come! Nay,
speak.

  Guil. What should we say, my lord?
  Ham. Why, anything- but to th' purpose. You were sent for; a
nd
    there is a kind of confession in your looks, which your
modesties
    have not craft enoug
h to colour. I know the good King and
Queen
    have sent for you.
  Ros. To what end, my lord?

  Ham. That you must teach me. But let me conjure you by the
rights
    of our fellowship, by the 
consonancy of our youth, by the
    obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear
a

    better proposer could charge you withal, be even and direct
with
    me, whether you were se
nt for or no.
  Ros. [aside to Guildenstern] What say you?
  Ham. [aside] Nay then, I have an eye 
of you.- If you love me,
hold
    not off.
  Guil. My lord, we were sent for.
  Ham. I will tell
 you why. So shall my anticipation prevent your
    discovery, and your secrecy to the King and Que
en moult no
    feather. I have of late- but wherefore I know not- lost all
my
    mirth, forgone
 all custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes
so
    heavily with my disposition that this goodly 
frame, the
earth,
    seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy,
the
    air,
 look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this
majestical
    roof fretted with golden fire- wh
y, it appeareth no other
thing
    to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What

a
    piece of work is a man! how noble in reason! how infinite in
    faculties! in form and movi
ng how express and admirable! in
    action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the

    beauty of the world, the paragon of animals! And yet to me
what
    is this quintessence of d
ust? Man delights not me- no, nor
woman
    neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.
 
 Ros. My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.
  Ham. Why did you laugh then, when I said '
Man delights not me'?
  Ros. To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten
    enterta
inment the players shall receive from you. We coted
them
    on the way, and hither are they comin
g to offer you service.
  Ham. He that plays the king shall be welcome- his Majesty shall
    have
 tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil
and
    target; the lover shall not sigh
 gratis; the humorous man
shall
    end his part in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose

    lungs are tickle o' th' sere; and the lady shall say her mind
    freely, or the blank verse s
hall halt for't. What players are
    they?
  Ros. Even those you were wont to take such delight i
n, the
    tragedians of the city.
  Ham. How chances it they travel? Their residence, both in
  
  reputation and profit, was better both ways.
  Ros. I think their inhibition comes by the means o
f the late
    innovation.
  Ham. Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in
the
  
  city? Are they so follow'd?
  Ros. No indeed are they not.
  Ham. How comes it? Do they grow rus
ty?
  Ros. Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there
is,
    sir, an eyrie of chil
dren, little eyases, that cry out on the
top
    of question and are most tyrannically clapp'd for
't. These
are now
    the fashion, and so berattle the common stages (so they call
    them) that
 many wearing rapiers are afraid of goosequills and
    dare scarce come thither.
  Ham. What, are
 they children? Who maintains 'em? How are they
    escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer
 than they can
    sing? Will they not say afterwards, if they should grow
    themselves to commo
n players (as it is most like, if their
means
    are no better), their writers do them wrong to m
ake them
exclaim
    against their own succession.
  Ros. Faith, there has been much to do on bot
h sides; and the
nation
    holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy. There was, for
a
    w
hile, no money bid for argument unless the poet and the
player
    went to cuffs in the question.

  Ham. Is't possible?
  Guil. O, there has been much throwing about of brains.
  Ham. Do the boys
 carry it away?
  Ros. Ay, that they do, my lord- Hercules and his load too.
  Ham. It is not very
 strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark,
and
    those that would make mows at him while my fath
er lived give
    twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his picture
in
    little. 'S
blood, there is something in this more than
natural, if
    philosophy could find it out.

     
                Flourish for the Players.

  Guil. There are the players.
  Ham. Gentlemen, you a
re welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come!
Th'
    appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony.
 Let me
comply
    with you in this garb, lest my extent to the players (which I
    tell you mus
t show fairly outwards) should more appear like
    entertainment than yours. You are welcome. But 
my
uncle-father
    and aunt-mother are deceiv'd.
  Guil. In what, my dear lord?
  Ham. I am but
 mad north-north-west. When the wind is southerly
I
    know a hawk from a handsaw.

           
                 Enter Polonius.

  Pol. Well be with you, gentlemen!
  Ham. Hark you, Guildenste
rn- and you too- at each ear a hearer!
    That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swad
dling
    clouts.
  Ros. Happily he's the second time come to them; for they say an
old
    man 
is twice a child.
  Ham. I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players. Mark
it.-
   You say
 right, sir; a Monday morning; twas so indeed.
  Pol. My lord, I have news to tell you.
  Ham. My 
lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an
actor in
    Rome-
  Pol. The actors are come 
hither, my lord.
  Ham. Buzz, buzz!
  Pol. Upon my honour-
  Ham. Then came each actor on his ass
-
  Pol. The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy,
    history, pastoral, pastoral
-comical, historical-pastoral,
    tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral;
scen
e
    individable, or poem unlimited. Seneca cannot be too heavy,
nor
    Plautus too light. For 
the law of writ and the liberty, these
are
    the only men.
  Ham. O Jephthah, judge of Israel, 
what a treasure hadst thou!
  Pol. What treasure had he, my lord?
  Ham. Why,

         'One fai
r daughter, and no more,
           The which he loved passing well.'

  Pol. [aside] Still on my
 daughter.
  Ham. Am I not i' th' right, old Jephthah?
  Pol. If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I 
have a daughter that I
    love passing well.
  Ham. Nay, that follows not.
  Pol. What follows t
hen, my lord?
  Ham. Why,

           'As by lot, God wot,'

 and then, you know,

          
 'It came to pass, as most like it was.'

    The first row of the pious chanson will show you mor
e; for
look
    where my abridgment comes.

                     Enter four or five Players.


    You are welcome, masters; welcome, all.- I am glad to see
thee
    well.- Welcome, good friend
s.- O, my old friend? Why, thy
face is
    valanc'd since I saw thee last. Com'st' thou to' beard 
me in
    Denmark?- What, my young lady and mistress? By'r Lady, your
    ladyship is nearer to he
aven than when I saw you last by the
    altitude of a chopine. Pray God your voice, like a piece o
f
    uncurrent gold, be not crack'd within the ring.- Masters, you
are
    all welcome. We'll e'
en to't like French falconers, fly at
    anything we see. We'll have a speech straight. Come, give
 us
a
    taste of your quality. Come, a passionate speech.
  1. Play. What speech, my good lord?

  Ham. I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never
acted;
    or if it was, not above 
once; for the play, I remember,
pleas'd
    not the million, 'twas caviary to the general; but it 
was (as
I
    receiv'd it, and others, whose judgments in such matters
cried in
    the top of m
ine) an excellent play, well digested in the
scenes,
    set down with as much modesty as cunning.
 I remember one said
    there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter
savoury,
    nor n
o matter in the phrase that might indict the author of
    affectation; but call'd it an honest met
hod, as wholesome as
    sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech
in't
    I c
hiefly lov'd. 'Twas AEneas' tale to Dido, and thereabout
of it
    especially where he speaks of P
riam's slaughter. If it live
in
    your memory, begin at this line- let me see, let me see:

  
       'The rugged Pyrrhus, like th' Hyrcanian beast-'

    'Tis not so; it begins with Pyrrhus:


         'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
         Black as his purpose, did the night r
esemble
         When he lay couched in the ominous horse,
         Hath now this dread and black 
complexion smear'd
         With heraldry more dismal. Head to foot
         Now is be total gules
, horridly trick'd
         With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
         Bak'd and im
pasted with the parching streets,
         That lend a tyrannous and a damned light
         To th
eir lord's murther. Roasted in wrath and fire,
         And thus o'ersized with coagulate gore,
  
       With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
         Old grandsire Priam seeks.'

    S
o, proceed you.
  Pol. Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good
     discretion.


  1. Play. 'Anon he finds him,
      Striking too short at Greeks. His antique sword,
      Reb
ellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
      Repugnant to command. Unequal match'd,
      Pyrrhu
s at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide;
      But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
     
 Th' unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
      Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top

      Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
      Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear. For lo! his
 sword,
      Which was declining on the milky head
      Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' th' air to 
stick.
      So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
      And, like a neutral to his will and mat
ter,
      Did nothing.
      But, as we often see, against some storm,
      A silence in the he
avens, the rack stand still,
      The bold winds speechless, and the orb below
      As hush as d
eath- anon the dreadful thunder
      Doth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
      Arouse
d vengeance sets him new awork;
      And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
      On Mars's armo
ur, forg'd for proof eterne,
      With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
      Now falls 
on Priam.
      Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods,
      In general synod take away he
r power;
      Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
      And bowl the round nave down
 the hill of heaven,
      As low as to the fiends!

  Pol. This is too long.
  Ham. It shall to
 the barber's, with your beard.- Prithee say
on.
    He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sle
eps. Say on;
come to
    Hecuba.

  1. Play. 'But who, O who, had seen the mobled queen-'

  H
am. 'The mobled queen'?
  Pol. That's good! 'Mobled queen' is good.

  1. Play. 'Run barefoot up 
and down, threat'ning the flames
      With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head
      Where late 
the diadem stood, and for a robe,
      About her lank and all o'erteemed loins,
      A blanket, 
in the alarm of fear caught up-
      Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd
      'Gains
t Fortune's state would treason have pronounc'd.
      But if the gods themselves did see her then,

      When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
      In Mincing with his sword her husband's lim
bs,
      The instant burst of clamour that she made
      (Unless things mortal move them not at 
all)
      Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven
      And passion in the gods.'

  P
ol. Look, whe'r he has not turn'd his colour, and has tears
in's
    eyes. Prithee no more!
  Ham
. 'Tis well. I'll have thee speak out the rest of this
soon.-
    Good my lord, will you see the p
layers well bestow'd? Do you
    hear? Let them be well us'd; for they are the abstract and
brief

    chronicles of the time. After your death you were better have
a
    bad epitaph than their il
l report while you live.
  Pol. My lord, I will use them according to their desert.
  Ham. God's b
odykins, man, much better! Use every man after his
    desert, and who should scape whipping? Use t
hem after your
own
    honour and dignity. The less they deserve, the more merit is
in
    your 
bounty. Take them in.
  Pol. Come, sirs.
  Ham. Follow him, friends. We'll hear a play to-morrow.

                 Exeunt Polonius and Players [except the First].
    Dost thou hear me, old friend
? Can you play 'The Murther of
    Gonzago'?
  1. Play. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. We'll ha't to-morrow 
night. You could, for a need, study a
    speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which I would set d
own
and
    insert in't, could you not?
  1. Play. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Very well. Follow that lo
rd- and look you mock him not.
                                            [Exit First Player.]
  
  My good friends, I'll leave you till night. You are welcome
to
    Elsinore.
  Ros. Good my lor
d!
  Ham. Ay, so, God b' wi' ye!
                            [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern

    Now I am alone.
    O what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
    Is it not monstrous that this 
player here,
    But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
    Could force his soul so to his own c
onceit
    That, from her working, all his visage wann'd,
    Tears in his eyes, distraction in's 
aspect,
    A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
    With forms to his conceit? And all 
for nothing!
    For Hecuba!
    What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
    That he should weep f
or her? What would he do,
    Had he the motive and the cue for passion
    That I have? He would 
drown the stage with tears
    And cleave the general ear with horrid speech;
    Make mad the gui
lty and appal the free,
    Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed
    The very faculties of eyes
 and ears.
    Yet I,
    A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak
    Like John-a-dreams, unpregnan
t of my cause,
    And can say nothing! No, not for a king,
    Upon whose property and most dear 
life
    A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
    Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?

    Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?
    Tweaks me by th' nose? gives me the lie i' t
h' throat
    As deep as to the lungs? Who does me this, ha?
    'Swounds, I should take it! for i
t cannot be
    But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall
    To make oppression bitter, or ere this

    I should have fatted all the region kites
    With this slave's offal. Bloody bawdy villain!
 
   Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
    O, vengeance!
    Why, what an ass a
m I! This is most brave,
    That I, the son of a dear father murther'd,
    Prompted to my reveng
e by heaven and hell,
    Must (like a whore) unpack my heart with words
    And fall a-cursing li
ke a very drab,
    A scullion!
    Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! Hum, I have heard
    That 
guilty creatures, sitting at a play,
    Have by the very cunning of the scene
    Been struck so 
to the soul that presently
    They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
    For murther, though it
 have no tongue, will speak
    With most miraculous organ, I'll have these Players
    Play somet
hing like the murther of my father
    Before mine uncle. I'll observe his looks;
    I'll tent hi
m to the quick. If he but blench,
    I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
    May be a d
evil; and the devil hath power
    T' assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
    Out of my weak
ness and my melancholy,
    As he is very potent with such spirits,
    Abuses me to damn me. I'll
 have grounds
    More relative than this. The play's the thing
    Wherein I'll catch the conscie
nce of the King.         Exit.

ACT III. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the Castl
e.

Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern,
and Lords.

  King. And ca
n you by no drift of circumstance
    Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
    Grating so h
arshly all his days of quiet
    With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
  Ros. He does confess he fe
els himself distracted,
    But from what cause he will by no means speak.
  Guil. Nor do we find 
him forward to be sounded,
    But with a crafty madness keeps aloof
    When we would bring him o
n to some confession
    Of his true state.
  Queen. Did he receive you well?
  Ros. Most like a 
gentleman.
  Guil. But with much forcing of his disposition.
  Ros. Niggard of question, but of ou
r demands
    Most free in his reply.
  Queen. Did you assay him
    To any pastime?
  Ros. Mada
m, it so fell out that certain players
    We o'erraught on the way. Of these we told him,
    And
 there did seem in him a kind of joy
    To hear of it. They are here about the court,
    And, as
 I think, they have already order
    This night to play before him.
  Pol. 'Tis most true;
    A
nd he beseech'd me to entreat your Majesties
    To hear and see the matter.
  King. With all my h
eart, and it doth much content me
    To hear him so inclin'd.
    Good gentlemen, give him a furt
her edge
    And drive his purpose on to these delights.
  Ros. We shall, my lord.
              
              Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
  King. Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
    For w
e have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
    That he, as 'twere by accident, may here
    Affront Op
helia.
    Her father and myself (lawful espials)
    Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing unseen
,
    We may of their encounter frankly judge
    And gather by him, as he is behav'd,
    If't b
e th' affliction of his love, or no,
    That thus he suffers for.
  Queen. I shall obey you;
   
 And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
    That your good beauties be the happy cause
    Of Hamle
t's wildness. So shall I hope your virtues
    Will bring him to his wonted way again,
    To both
 your honours.
  Oph. Madam, I wish it may.
                                                   [Ex
it Queen.]
  Pol. Ophelia, walk you here.- Gracious, so please you,
    We will bestow ourselves.-
 [To Ophelia] Read on this book,
    That show of such an exercise may colour
    Your loneliness.
- We are oft to blame in this,
    'Tis too much prov'd, that with devotion's visage
    And pious
 action we do sugar o'er
    The Devil himself.
  King. [aside] O, 'tis too true!
    How smart a
 lash that speech doth give my conscience!
    The harlot's cheek, beautied with plast'ring art,
 
   Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
    Than is my deed to my most painted word.
    O 
heavy burthen!
  Pol. I hear him coming. Let's withdraw, my lord.
                                
      Exeunt King and Polonius].

                           Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. To be, or not
 to be- that is the question:
    Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
    The slings and arr
ows of outrageous fortune
    Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
    And by opposing end t
hem. To die- to sleep-
    No more; and by a sleep to say we end
    The heartache, and the thousa
nd natural shocks
    That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation
    Devoutly to be wish'd. To die
- to sleep.
    To sleep- perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub!
    For in that sleep of death 
what dreams may come
    When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
    Must give us pause. There
's the respect
    That makes calamity of so long life.
    For who would bear the whips and scorn
s of time,
    Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
    The pangs of despis'd love, t
he law's delay,
    The insolence of office, and the spurns
    That patient merit of th' unworthy
 takes,
    When he himself might his quietus make
    With a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels
 bear,
    To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
    But that the dread of something after death-

    The undiscover'd country, from whose bourn
    No traveller returns- puzzles the will,
    A
nd makes us rather bear those ills we have
    Than fly to others that we know not of?
    Thus co
nscience does make cowards of us all,
    And thus the native hue of resolution
    Is sicklied o'
er with the pale cast of thought,
    And enterprises of great pith and moment
    With this regar
d their currents turn awry
    And lose the name of action.- Soft you now!
    The fair Ophelia!- 
Nymph, in thy orisons
    Be all my sins rememb'red.
  Oph. Good my lord,
    How does your honou
r for this many a day?
  Ham. I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
  Oph. My lord, I have remembr
ances of yours
    That I have longed long to re-deliver.
    I pray you, now receive them.
  Ham
. No, not I!
    I never gave you aught.
  Oph. My honour'd lord, you know right well you did,
  
  And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd
    As made the things more rich. Their perfume l
ost,
    Take these again; for to the noble mind
    Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.

    There, my lord.
  Ham. Ha, ha! Are you honest?
  Oph. My lord?
  Ham. Are you fair?
  Oph.
 What means your lordship?
  Ham. That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit
no
  
  discourse to your beauty.
  Oph. Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with
honesty?

  Ham. Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform
    honesty from what it is to a b
awd than the force of honesty
can
    translate beauty into his likeness. This was sometime a
par
adox,
    but now the time gives it proof. I did love you once.
  Oph. Indeed, my lord, you made m
e believe so.
  Ham. You should not have believ'd me; for virtue cannot so
    inoculate our old s
tock but we shall relish of it. I loved
you
    not.
  Oph. I was the more deceived.
  Ham. Get 
thee to a nunnery! Why wouldst thou be a breeder of
    sinners? I am myself indifferent honest, bu
t yet I could
accuse
    me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne
me.
    I
 am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more offences at
my
    beck than I have thoughts to p
ut them in, imagination to give
    them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows
a
s I
    do, crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves
all;
    believe none of us. 
Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where's your
    father?
  Oph. At home, my lord.
  Ham. Let the doors 
be shut upon him, that he may play the fool
    nowhere but in's own house. Farewell.
  Oph. O, he
lp him, you sweet heavens!
  Ham. If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy
dowry:
 
   be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not
escape
    calumny. Get thee to a nun
nery. Go, farewell. Or if thou wilt
    needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough wh
at
    monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go; and quickly too.
    Farewell.
  Oph. O heave
nly powers, restore him!
  Ham. I have heard of your paintings too, well enough. God hath
    give
n you one face, and you make yourselves another. You jig,
you
    amble, and you lisp; you nicknam
e God's creatures and make
your
    wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't! it hath

made
    me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages. Those that are
    married already- all bu
t one- shall live; the rest shall keep
as
    they are. To a nunnery, go.                         
   Exit.
  Oph. O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
    The courtier's, scholar's, soldier's,
 eye, tongue, sword,
    Th' expectancy and rose of the fair state,
    The glass of fashion and t
he mould of form,
    Th' observ'd of all observers- quite, quite down!
    And I, of ladies most 
deject and wretched,
    That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
    Now see that noble and most 
sovereign reason,
    Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
    That unmatch'd form and
 feature of blown youth
    Blasted with ecstasy. O, woe is me
    T' have seen what I have seen, 
see what I see!

                   Enter King and Polonius.

  King. Love? his affections do no
t that way tend;
    Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,
    Was not like madness. 
There's something in his soul
    O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
    And I do doubt the 
hatch and the disclose
    Will be some danger; which for to prevent,
    I have in quick determin
ation
    Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England
    For the demand of our neglected tri
bute.
    Haply the seas, and countries different,
    With variable objects, shall expel
    Thi
s something-settled matter in his heart,
    Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
    Fr
om fashion of himself. What think you on't?
  Pol. It shall do well. But yet do I believe
    The 
origin and commencement of his grief
    Sprung from neglected love.- How now, Ophelia?
    You ne
ed not tell us what Lord Hamlet said.
    We heard it all.- My lord, do as you please;
    But if 
you hold it fit, after the play
    Let his queen mother all alone entreat him
    To show his gri
ef. Let her be round with him;
    And I'll be plac'd so please you, in the ear
    Of all their c
onference. If she find him not,
    To England send him; or confine him where
    Your wisdom best
 shall think.
  King. It shall be so.
    Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.         Exe
unt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. hall in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet and three of the Players.


  Ham. Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounc'd it to you,
    trippingly on the tongue. But i
f you mouth it, as many of our
    players do, I had as live the town crier spoke my lines. Nor
do

    not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all
    gently; for in the very torren
t, tempest, and (as I may say)
    whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and beget a
    tem
perance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to
the
    soul to hear a robustious periwig
-pated fellow tear a passion
to
    tatters, to very rags, to split the cars of the groundlings,

who
    (for the most part) are capable of nothing but inexplicable
dumb
    shows and noise. I w
ould have such a fellow whipp'd for
o'erdoing
    Termagant. It out-herods Herod. Pray you avoid i
t.
  Player. I warrant your honour.
  Ham. Be not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be

your
    tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the action;
with
    this special obse
rvance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of
    nature: for anything so overdone is from the purpo
se of
playing,
    whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as
    'twere, the 
mirror up to nature; to show Virtue her own
feature,
    scorn her own image, and the very age and
 body of the time
his
    form and pressure. Now this overdone, or come tardy off,
though
    it
 make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious
    grieve; the censure of the which one m
ust in your allowance
    o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that
I
    hav
e seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly (not
to
    speak it profanely), that, neith
er having the accent of
    Christians, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have
so
    st
rutted and bellowed that I have thought some of Nature's
    journeymen had made men, and not made 
them well, they
imitated
    humanity so abominably.
  Player. I hope we have reform'd that indif
ferently with us,
sir.
  Ham. O, reform it altogether! And let those that play your
clowns
    s
peak no more than is set down for them. For there be of them
    that will themselves laugh, to set
 on some quantity of barren
    spectators to laugh too, though in the mean time some
necessary
 
   question of the play be then to be considered. That's
villanous
    and shows a most pitiful am
bition in the fool that uses it.
Go
    make you ready.
                                         
        Exeunt Players.

            Enter Polonius, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.

    How now
, my lord? Will the King hear this piece of work?
  Pol. And the Queen too, and that presently.
  
Ham. Bid the players make haste, [Exit Polonius.] Will you two
    help to hasten them?
  Both. We
 will, my lord.                       Exeunt they two.
  Ham. What, ho, Horatio!

               
       Enter Horatio.

  Hor. Here, sweet lord, at your service.
  Ham. Horatio, thou art e'en as
 just a man
    As e'er my conversation cop'd withal.
  Hor. O, my dear lord!
  Ham. Nay, do not 
think I flatter;
    For what advancement may I hope from thee,
    That no revenue hast but thy g
ood spirits
    To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
    No, let the candied
 tongue lick absurd pomp,
    And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
    Where thrift may follo
w fawning. Dost thou hear?
    Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
    And could of men 
distinguish, her election
    Hath seal'd thee for herself. For thou hast been
    As one, in suff
'ring all, that suffers nothing;
    A man that Fortune's buffets and rewards
    Hast ta'en with 
equal thanks; and blest are those
    Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled
    That the
y are not a pipe for Fortune's finger
    To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
    That
 is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
    In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
   
 As I do thee. Something too much of this I
    There is a play to-night before the King.
    One 
scene of it comes near the circumstance,
    Which I have told thee, of my father's death.
    I p
rithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
    Even with the very comment of thy soul
    Observe my 
uncle. If his occulted guilt
    Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
    It is a damned ghost th
at we have seen,
    And my imaginations are as foul
    As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note
;
    For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,
    And after we will both our judgments join
    I
n censure of his seeming.
  Hor. Well, my lord.
    If he steal aught the whilst this play is play
ing,
    And scape detecting, I will pay the theft.

    Sound a flourish. [Enter Trumpets and Ke
ttledrums. Danish
    march. [Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz,
      Guildenster
n, and other Lords attendant, with the Guard
                       carrying torches.

  Ham. The
y are coming to the play. I must be idle.
    Get you a place.
  King. How fares our cousin Hamlet
?
  Ham. Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish. I eat the
air,
    promise-cramm'd. You ca
nnot feed capons so.
  King. I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet. These words are
not
    min
e.
  Ham. No, nor mine now. [To Polonius] My lord, you play'd once
    i' th' university, you say?

  Pol. That did I, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.
  Ham. What did you enact?
  Pol. I 
did enact Julius Caesar; I was kill'd i' th' Capitol;
Brutus
    kill'd me.
  Ham. It was a brute
 part of him to kill so capital a calf
there. Be
    the players ready.
  Ros. Ay, my lord. They 
stay upon your patience.
  Queen. Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
  Ham. No, good mother. 
Here's metal more attractive.
  Pol. [to the King] O, ho! do you mark that?
  Ham. Lady, shall I l
ie in your lap?
                                  [Sits down at Ophelia's feet.]

  Oph. No, my l
ord.
  Ham. I mean, my head upon your lap?
  Oph. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Do you think I meant countr
y matters?
  Oph. I think nothing, my lord.
  Ham. That's a fair thought to lie between maids' leg
s.
  Oph. What is, my lord?
  Ham. Nothing.
  Oph. You are merry, my lord.
  Ham. Who, I?
  Oph
. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. O God, your only jig-maker! What should a man do but be
merry?
    For look
 you how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father
died
    within 's two hours.
  Oph. Nay 'tis 
twice two months, my lord.
  Ham. So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I'll have
a
  
  suit of sables. O heavens! die two months ago, and not
forgotten
    yet? Then there's hope a gr
eat man's memory may outlive his
life
    half a year. But, by'r Lady, he must build churches then
; or
else
    shall he suffer not thinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose

    epitaph is 'For 
O, for O, the hobby-horse is forgot!'

               Hautboys play. The dumb show enters.

    
Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing
    him and he her. She kneels, and mak
es show of protestation
    unto him. He takes her up, and declines his head upon her
    neck. He
 lays him down upon a bank of flowers. She, seeing
    him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fell
ow, takes off his
    crown, kisses it, pours poison in the sleeper's ears, and
    leaves him. Th
e Queen returns, finds the King dead, and makes
    passionate action. The Poisoner with some three
 or four
Mutes,
    comes in again, seem to condole with her. The dead body is
    carried away. 
The Poisoner wooes the Queen with gifts; she
    seems harsh and unwilling awhile, but in the end a
ccepts
    his love.
                                                         Exeunt.

  Oph. Wh
at means this, my lord?
  Ham. Marry, this is miching malhecho; it means mischief.
  Oph. Belike t
his show imports the argument of the play.

                      Enter Prologue.

  Ham. We sha
ll know by this fellow. The players cannot keep
counsel;
    they'll tell all.
  Oph. Will he tel
l us what this show meant?
  Ham. Ay, or any show that you'll show him. Be not you asham'd
to
   
 show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means.
  Oph. You are naught, you are naught! I'll mark 
the play.

    Pro. For us, and for our tragedy,
      Here stooping to your clemency,
      We 
beg your hearing patiently.                     [Exit.]

  Ham. Is this a prologue, or the posy of
 a ring?
  Oph. 'Tis brief, my lord.
  Ham. As woman's love.

              Enter [two Players a
s] King and Queen.

    King. Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round
      Neptune's sal
t wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
      And thirty dozen moons with borrowed sheen
      About the 
world have times twelve thirties been,
      Since love our hearts, and Hymen did our hands,
     
 Unite comutual in most sacred bands.
    Queen. So many journeys may the sun and moon
      Make 
us again count o'er ere love be done!
      But woe is me! you are so sick of late,
      So far f
rom cheer and from your former state.
      That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
      Dis
comfort you, my lord, it nothing must;
      For women's fear and love holds quantity,
      In ne
ither aught, or in extremity.
      Now what my love is, proof hath made you know;
      And as my
 love is siz'd, my fear is so.
      Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
      Wher
e little fears grow great, great love grows there.
    King. Faith, I must leave thee, love, and sh
ortly too;
      My operant powers their functions leave to do.
      And thou shalt live in this 
fair world behind,
      Honour'd, belov'd, and haply one as kind
      For husband shalt thou-
 
   Queen. O, confound the rest!
      Such love must needs be treason in my breast.
      When sec
ond husband let me be accurst!
      None wed the second but who killed the first.

  Ham. [aside
] Wormwood, wormwood!

    Queen. The instances that second marriage move
      Are base respects
 of thrift, but none of love.
      A second time I kill my husband dead
      When second husband
 kisses me in bed.
    King. I do believe you think what now you speak;
      But what we do deter
mine oft we break.
      Purpose is but the slave to memory,
      Of violent birth, but poor vali
dity;
      Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree,
      But fall unshaken when they me
llow be.
      Most necessary 'tis that we forget
      To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt
.
      What to ourselves in passion we propose,
      The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.

      The violence of either grief or joy
      Their own enactures with themselves destroy.
    
  Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
      Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident
.
      This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
      That even our loves should with our 
fortunes change;
      For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
      Whether love lead fortune, 
or else fortune love.
      The great man down, you mark his favourite flies,
      The poor advan
c'd makes friends of enemies;
      And hitherto doth love on fortune tend,
      For who not need
s shall never lack a friend,
      And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
      Directly season
s him his enemy.
      But, orderly to end where I begun,
      Our wills and fates do so contrary
 run
      That our devices still are overthrown;
      Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of 
our own.
      So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
      But die thy thoughts when thy first
 lord is dead.
    Queen. Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light,
      Sport and repose lock
 from me day and night,
      To desperation turn my trust and hope,
      An anchor's cheer in pr
ison be my scope,
      Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
      Meet what I would have wel
l, and it destroy,
      Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
      If, once a widow, eve
r I be wife!

  Ham. If she should break it now!

    King. 'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me h
ere awhile.
      My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile
      The tedious day with sleep.

    Queen. Sleep rock thy brain,
                                                    [He] sleeps.

      And never come mischance between us twain!
Exit.

  Ham. Madam, how like you this play?

  Queen. The lady doth protest too much, methinks.
  Ham. O, but she'll keep her word.
  King. Hav
e you heard the argument? Is there no offence in't?
  Ham. No, no! They do but jest, poison in jest
; no offence i'
th'
    world.
  King. What do you call the play?
  Ham. 'The Mousetrap.' Marry,
 how? Tropically. This play is the
    image of a murther done in Vienna. Gonzago is the duke's
na
me;
    his wife, Baptista. You shall see anon. 'Tis a knavish piece
of
    work; but what o' tha
t? Your Majesty, and we that have free
    souls, it touches us not. Let the gall'd jade winch; our

withers
    are unwrung.

                         Enter Lucianus.

    This is one Lucianus,
 nephew to the King.
  Oph. You are as good as a chorus, my lord.
  Ham. I could interpret between
 you and your love, if I could
see
    the puppets dallying.
  Oph. You are keen, my lord, you ar
e keen.
  Ham. It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
  Oph. Still better, and worse.

  Ham. So you must take your husbands.- Begin, murtherer. Pox,
leave
    thy damnable faces, and b
egin! Come, the croaking raven doth
    bellow for revenge.

    Luc. Thoughts black, hands apt, 
drugs fit, and time agreeing;
      Confederate season, else no creature seeing;
      Thou mixtur
e rank, of midnight weeds collected,
      With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,
    
  Thy natural magic and dire property
      On wholesome life usurp immediately.
                 
                  Pours the poison in his ears.

  Ham. He poisons him i' th' garden for's estate.
 His name's
Gonzago.
    The story is extant, and written in very choice Italian. You
    shall s
ee anon how the murtherer gets the love of Gonzago's
wife.
  Oph. The King rises.
  Ham. What, fr
ighted with false fire?
  Queen. How fares my lord?
  Pol. Give o'er the play.
  King. Give me so
me light! Away!
  All. Lights, lights, lights!
                              Exeunt all but Hamlet
 and Horatio.
  Ham.   Why, let the strucken deer go weep,
          The hart ungalled play;
    
     For some must watch, while some must sleep:
          Thus runs the world away.
    Would not
 this, sir, and a forest of feathers- if the rest of
my
    fortunes turn Turk with me-with two Pr
ovincial roses on my
raz'd
    shoes, get me a fellowship in a cry of players, sir?
  Hor. Half a
 share.
  Ham.   A whole one I!
         For thou dost know, O Damon dear,
           This realm 
dismantled was
         Of Jove himself; and now reigns here
           A very, very- pajock.
  H
or. You might have rhym'd.
  Ham. O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand
    po
und! Didst perceive?
  Hor. Very well, my lord.
  Ham. Upon the talk of the poisoning?
  Hor. I d
id very well note him.
  Ham.   Aha! Come, some music! Come, the recorders!
         For if the Ki
ng like not the comedy,
         Why then, belike he likes it not, perdy.
    Come, some music!


                Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Guil. Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word wi
th you.
  Ham. Sir, a whole history.
  Guil. The King, sir-
  Ham. Ay, sir, what of him?
  Guil.
 Is in his retirement, marvellous distemper'd.
  Ham. With drink, sir?
  Guil. No, my lord; rather
 with choler.
  Ham. Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this
to
    the doctor
; for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps
    plunge him into far more choler.
  Guil. Go
od my lord, put your discourse into some frame, and
start
    not so wildly from my affair.
  Ham
. I am tame, sir; pronounce.
  Guil. The Queen, your mother, in most great affliction of
spirit
 
   hath sent me to you.
  Ham. You are welcome.
  Guil. Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of
 the right
breed.
    If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, I will
do
    your m
other's commandment; if not, your pardon and my return
    shall be the end of my business.
  Ham.
 Sir, I cannot.
  Guil. What, my lord?
  Ham. Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseas'd. But,
 sir,
such
    answer as I can make, you shall command; or rather, as you
say,
    my mother. Th
erefore no more, but to the matter! My mother,
you
    say-
  Ros. Then thus she says: your behav
iour hath struck her into
    amazement and admiration.
  Ham. O wonderful son, that can so stonis
h a mother! But is
there no
    sequel at the heels of this mother's admiration? Impart.
  Ros. S
he desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to
bed.
  Ham. We shall obey, were she ten t
imes our mother. Have you any
    further trade with us?
  Ros. My lord, you once did love me.
  
Ham. And do still, by these pickers and stealers!
  Ros. Good my lord, what is your cause of distem
per? You do
surely
    bar the door upon your own liberty, if you deny your griefs
to
    your f
riend.
  Ham. Sir, I lack advancement.
  Ros. How can that be, when you have the voice of the King

himself
    for your succession in Denmark?
  Ham. Ay, sir, but 'while the grass grows'- the pro
verb is
something
    musty.

                     Enter the Players with recorders.

    O, t
he recorders! Let me see one. To withdraw with you- why
do
    you go about to recover the wind of
 me, as if you would drive
me
    into a toil?
  Guil. O my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love
 is too
unmannerly.
  Ham. I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this
pipe?
  Guil. 
My lord, I cannot.
  Ham. I pray you.
  Guil. Believe me, I cannot.
  Ham. I do beseech you.
  G
uil. I know, no touch of it, my lord.
  Ham. It is as easy as lying. Govern these ventages with you
r
    fingers and thumbs, give it breath with your mouth, and it
will
    discourse most eloquent
 music. Look you, these are the stops.
  Guil. But these cannot I command to any utt'rance of harmo
ny. I
    have not the skill.
  Ham. Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me!
You

    would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you
would
    pluck out the heart of my 
mystery; you would sound me from my
    lowest note to the top of my compass; and there is much
mu
sic,
    excellent voice, in this little organ, yet cannot you make it
    speak. 'Sblood, do you 
think I am easier to be play'd on than
a
    pipe? Call me what instrument you will, though you ca
n fret
me,
    you cannot play upon me.

                        Enter Polonius.

    God bles
s you, sir!
  Pol. My lord, the Queen would speak with you, and presently.
  Ham. Do you see yonde
r cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
  Pol. By th' mass, and 'tis like a camel indeed.
  Ham
. Methinks it is like a weasel.
  Pol. It is back'd like a weasel.
  Ham. Or like a whale.
  Pol.
 Very like a whale.
  Ham. Then will I come to my mother by-and-by.- They fool me to
the
    top 
of my bent.- I will come by-and-by.
  Pol. I will say so.                                      Exit
.
  Ham. 'By-and-by' is easily said.- Leave me, friends.
                                        [
Exeunt all but Hamlet.]

    'Tis now the very witching time of night,
    When churchyards yawn,
 and hell itself breathes out
    Contagion to this world. Now could I drink hot blood
    And do 
such bitter business as the day
    Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother!
    O heart, l
ose not thy nature; let not ever
    The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom.
    Let me be cruel, 
not unnatural;
    I will speak daggers to her, but use none.
    My tongue and soul in this be hy
pocrites-
    How in my words somever she be shent,
    To give them seals never, my soul, consent
!             Exit.




Scene III.
A room in the Castle.

Enter King, Rosencrantz, and Guild
enstern.

  King. I like him not, nor stands it safe with us
    To let his madness range. Theref
ore prepare you;
    I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
    And he to England shall along 
with you.
    The terms of our estate may not endure
    Hazard so near us as doth hourly grow
  
  Out of his lunacies.
  Guil. We will ourselves provide.
    Most holy and religious fear it is

    To keep those many many bodies safe
    That live and feed upon your Majesty.
  Ros. The singl
e and peculiar life is bound
    With all the strength and armour of the mind
    To keep itself f
rom noyance; but much more
    That spirit upon whose weal depends and rests
    The lives of many
. The cesse of majesty
    Dies not alone, but like a gulf doth draw
    What's near it with it. I
t is a massy wheel,
    Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,
    To whose huge spokes ten tho
usand lesser things
    Are mortis'd and adjoin'd; which when it falls,
    Each small annexment, 
petty consequence,
    Attends the boist'rous ruin. Never alone
    Did the king sigh, but with a 
general groan.
  King. Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;
    For we will fetters put upo
n this fear,
    Which now goes too free-footed.
  Both. We will haste us.
                      
                         Exeunt Gentlemen.

                   Enter Polonius.

  Pol. My lord, 
he's going to his mother's closet.
    Behind the arras I'll convey myself
    To hear the process
. I'll warrant she'll tax him home;
    And, as you said, and wisely was it said,
    'Tis meet th
at some more audience than a mother,
    Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear
    The 
speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege.
    I'll call upon you ere you go to bed
    And tell
 you what I know.
  King. Thanks, dear my lord.
                                                Ex
it [Polonius].
    O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven;
    It hath the primal eldest curse
 upon't,
    A brother's murther! Pray can I not,
    Though inclination be as sharp as will.
   
 My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent,
    And, like a man to double business bound,
    I s
tand in pause where I shall first begin,
    And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
    Were t
hicker than itself with brother's blood,
    Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
    To 
wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
    But to confront the visage of offence?
    And wha
t's in prayer but this twofold force,
    To be forestalled ere we come to fall,
    Or pardon'd b
eing down? Then I'll look up;
    My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer
    Can serve my t
urn? 'Forgive me my foul murther'?
    That cannot be; since I am still possess'd
    Of those eff
ects for which I did the murther-
    My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.
    May one be pa
rdon'd and retain th' offence?
    In the corrupted currents of this world
    Offence's gilded ha
nd may shove by justice,
    And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
    Buys out the law; but '
tis not so above.
    There is no shuffling; there the action lies
    In his true nature, and we 
ourselves compell'd,
    Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
    To give in evidence. Wh
at then? What rests?
    Try what repentance can. What can it not?
    Yet what can it when one ca
nnot repent?
    O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
    O limed soul, that, struggling to b
e free,
    Art more engag'd! Help, angels! Make assay.
    Bow, stubborn knees; and heart with st
rings of steel,
    Be soft as sinews of the new-born babe!
    All may be well.                  
                He kneels.

                         Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Now might I do it pat
, now he is praying;
    And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven,
    And so am I reveng'd. Th
at would be scann'd.
    A villain kills my father; and for that,
    I, his sole son, do this sam
e villain send
    To heaven.
    Why, this is hire and salary, not revenge!
    He took my fathe
r grossly, full of bread,
    With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
    And how his au
dit stands, who knows save heaven?
    But in our circumstance and course of thought,
    'Tis hea
vy with him; and am I then reveng'd,
    To take him in the purging of his soul,
    When he is fi
t and seasoned for his passage?
    No.
    Up, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent.
    When
 he is drunk asleep; or in his rage;
    Or in th' incestuous pleasure of his bed;
    At gaming, 
swearing, or about some act
    That has no relish of salvation in't-
    Then trip him, that his 
heels may kick at heaven,
    And that his soul may be as damn'd and black
    As hell, whereto it
 goes. My mother stays.
    This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.              Exit.
  King. [
rises] My words fly up, my thoughts remain below.
    Words without thoughts never to heaven go.   
          Exit.




Scene IV.
The Queen's closet.

Enter Queen and Polonius.

  Pol. He wi
ll come straight. Look you lay home to him.
    Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear wit
h,
    And that your Grace hath screen'd and stood between
    Much heat and him. I'll silence me 
even here.
    Pray you be round with him.
  Ham. (within) Mother, mother, mother!
  Queen. I'll 
warrant you; fear me not. Withdraw; I hear him
coming.
                              [Polonius hid
es behind the arras.]

                          Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Now, mother, what's the m
atter?
  Queen. Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
  Ham. Mother, you have my father much
 offended.
  Queen. Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
  Ham. Go, go, you question with a
 wicked tongue.
  Queen. Why, how now, Hamlet?
  Ham. What's the matter now?
  Queen. Have you fo
rgot me?
  Ham. No, by the rood, not so!
    You are the Queen, your husband's brother's wife,
  
  And (would it were not so!) you are my mother.
  Queen. Nay, then I'll set those to you that can 
speak.
  Ham. Come, come, and sit you down. You shall not budge;
    You go not till I set you up 
a glass
    Where you may see the inmost part of you.
  Queen. What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not mu
rther me?
    Help, help, ho!
  Pol. [behind] What, ho! help, help, help!
  Ham. [draws] How now?
 a rat? Dead for a ducat, dead!
            [Makes a pass through the arras and] kills Polonius.
 
 Pol. [behind] O, I am slain!
  Queen. O me, what hast thou done?
  Ham. Nay, I know not. Is it th
e King?
  Queen. O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
  Ham. A bloody deed- almost as bad, good
 mother,
    As kill a king, and marry with his brother.
  Queen. As kill a king?
  Ham. Ay, lady
, it was my word.
                         [Lifts up the arras and sees Polonius.]
    Thou wretch
ed, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
    I took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune.
    Thou fin
d'st to be too busy is some danger.
    Leave wringing of your hands. Peace! sit you down
    And 
let me wring your heart; for so I shall
    If it be made of penetrable stuff;
    If damned custo
m have not braz'd it so
    That it is proof and bulwark against sense.
  Queen. What have I done 
that thou dar'st wag thy tongue
    In noise so rude against me?
  Ham. Such an act
    That blur
s the grace and blush of modesty;
    Calls virtue hypocrite; takes off the rose
    From the fair
 forehead of an innocent love,
    And sets a blister there; makes marriage vows
    As false as d
icers' oaths. O, such a deed
    As from the body of contraction plucks
    The very soul, and swe
et religion makes
    A rhapsody of words! Heaven's face doth glow;
    Yea, this solidity and com
pound mass,
    With tristful visage, as against the doom,
    Is thought-sick at the act.
  Quee
n. Ah me, what act,
    That roars so loud and thunders in the index?
  Ham. Look here upon th's p
icture, and on this,
    The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
    See what a grace was sea
ted on this brow;
    Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
    An eye like Mars, to threat
en and command;
    A station like the herald Mercury
    New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill:
 
   A combination and a form indeed
    Where every god did seem to set his seal
    To give the wo
rld assurance of a man.
    This was your husband. Look you now what follows.
    Here is your hus
band, like a mildew'd ear
    Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
    Could you on this
 fair mountain leave to feed,
    And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes
    You cannot call i
t love; for at your age
    The heyday in the blood is tame, it's humble,
    And waits upon the j
udgment; and what judgment
    Would step from this to this? Sense sure you have,
    Else could y
ou not have motion; but sure that sense
    Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,
    Nor sense
 to ecstacy was ne'er so thrall'd
    But it reserv'd some quantity of choice
    To serve in such
 a difference. What devil was't
    That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
    Eyes without 
feeling, feeling without sight,
    Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
    Or but a si
ckly part of one true sense
    Could not so mope.
    O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hel
l,
    If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
    To flaming youth let virtue be as wax
    An
d melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame
    When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
    Sin
ce frost itself as actively doth burn,
    And reason panders will.
  Queen. O Hamlet, speak no mo
re!
    Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul,
    And there I see such black and grained spots

    As will not leave their tinct.
  Ham. Nay, but to live
    In the rank sweat of an enseamed 
bed,
    Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love
    Over the nasty sty!
  Queen. O, speak
 to me no more!
    These words like daggers enter in mine ears.
    No more, sweet Hamlet!
  Ham
. A murtherer and a villain!
    A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
    Of your preceden
t lord; a vice of kings;
    A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
    That from a shelf the prec
ious diadem stole
    And put it in his pocket!
  Queen. No more!

                Enter the Gho
st in his nightgown.

  Ham. A king of shreds and patches!-
    Save me and hover o'er me with yo
ur wings,
    You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?
  Queen. Alas, he's mad!
  Ha
m. Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
    That, laps'd in time and passion, lets go by
    T
h' important acting of your dread command?
    O, say!
  Ghost. Do not forget. This visitation
  
  Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
    But look, amazement on thy mother sits.
    O, st
ep between her and her fighting soul
    Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works.
    Speak to h
er, Hamlet.
  Ham. How is it with you, lady?
  Queen. Alas, how is't with you,
    That you do be
nd your eye on vacancy,
    And with th' encorporal air do hold discourse?
    Forth at your eyes 
your spirits wildly peep;
    And, as the sleeping soldiers in th' alarm,
    Your bedded hairs, l
ike life in excrements,
    Start up and stand an end. O gentle son,
    Upon the heat and flame o
f thy distemper
    Sprinkle cool patience! Whereon do you look?
  Ham. On him, on him! Look you h
ow pale he glares!
    His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
    Would make them capa
ble.- Do not look upon me,
    Lest with this piteous action you convert
    My stern effects. The
n what I have to do
    Will want true colour- tears perchance for blood.
  Queen. To whom do you 
speak this?
  Ham. Do you see nothing there?
  Queen. Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
  Ha
m. Nor did you nothing hear?
  Queen. No, nothing but ourselves.
  Ham. Why, look you there! Look 
how it steals away!
    My father, in his habit as he liv'd!
    Look where he goes even now out a
t the portal!
                                                     Exit Ghost.
  Queen. This is th
e very coinage of your brain.
    This bodiless creation ecstasy
    Is very cunning in.
  Ham. E
cstasy?
    My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time
    And makes as healthful music. It is n
ot madness
    That I have utt'red. Bring me to the test,
    And I the matter will reword; which 
madness
    Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
    Lay not that flattering unction to y
our soul
    That not your trespass but my madness speaks.
    It will but skin and film the ulcer
ous place,
    Whiles rank corruption, mining all within,
    Infects unseen. Confess yourself to 
heaven;
    Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
    And do not spread the compost on the we
eds
    To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;
    For in the fatness of these pursy time
s
    Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg-
    Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.
  Qu
een. O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
  Ham. O, throw away the worser part of it,
    
And live the purer with the other half,
    Good night- but go not to my uncle's bed.
    Assume a
 virtue, if you have it not.
    That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat
    Of habits evil, 
is angel yet in this,
    That to the use of actions fair and good
    He likewise gives a frock o
r livery,
    That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,
    And that shall lend a kind of easiness

    To the next abstinence; the next more easy;
    For use almost can change the stamp of nature,

    And either [master] the devil, or throw him out
    With wondrous potency. Once more, good nig
ht;
    And when you are desirous to be blest,
    I'll blessing beg of you.- For this same lord,

    I do repent; but heaven hath pleas'd it so,
    To punish me with this, and this with me,
   
 That I must be their scourge and minister.
    I will bestow him, and will answer well
    The de
ath I gave him. So again, good night.
    I must be cruel, only to be kind;
    Thus bad begins, a
nd worse remains behind.
    One word more, good lady.
  Queen. What shall I do?
  Ham. Not this,
 by no means, that I bid you do:
    Let the bloat King tempt you again to bed;
    Pinch wanton o
n your cheek; call you his mouse;
    And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
    Or paddling in
 your neck with his damn'd fingers,
    Make you to ravel all this matter out,
    That I essentia
lly am not in madness,
    But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;
    For who that's but 
a queen, fair, sober, wise,
    Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib
    Such dear concernings 
hide? Who would do so?
    No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
    Unpeg the basket on the house'
s top,
    Let the birds fly, and like the famous ape,
    To try conclusions, in the basket creep

    And break your own neck down.
  Queen. Be thou assur'd, if words be made of breath,
    And 
breath of life, I have no life to breathe
    What thou hast said to me.
  Ham. I must to England;
 you know that?
  Queen. Alack,
    I had forgot! 'Tis so concluded on.
  Ham. There's letters se
al'd; and my two schoolfellows,
    Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,
    They bear the m
andate; they must sweep my way
    And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
    For 'tis the sport 
to have the enginer
    Hoist with his own petar; and 't shall go hard
    But I will delve one ya
rd below their mines
    And blow them at the moon. O, 'tis most sweet
    When in one line two cr
afts directly meet.
    This man shall set me packing.
    I'll lug the guts into the neighbour ro
om.-
    Mother, good night.- Indeed, this counsellor
    Is now most still, most secret, and most
 grave,
    Who was in life a foolish peating knave.
    Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you
.
    Good night, mother.
                  [Exit the Queen. Then] Exit Hamlet, tugging in
      
                                                 Polonius.

ACT IV. Scene I.
El
sinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King and Queen, with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  King.
 There's matter in these sighs. These profound heaves
    You must translate; 'tis fit we understan
d them.
    Where is your son?
  Queen. Bestow this place on us a little while.
                 
         [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
    Ah, mine own lord, what have I seen to-night!

  King. What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
  Queen. Mad as the sea and wind when both contend
    Wh
ich is the mightier. In his lawless fit
    Behind the arras hearing something stir,
    Whips out
 his rapier, cries 'A rat, a rat!'
    And in this brainish apprehension kills
    The unseen good
 old man.
  King. O heavy deed!
    It had been so with us, had we been there.
    His liberty is
 full of threats to all-
    To you yourself, to us, to every one.
    Alas, how shall this bloody
 deed be answer'd?
    It will be laid to us, whose providence
    Should have kept short, restrai
n'd, and out of haunt
    This mad young man. But so much was our love
    We would not understand
 what was most fit,
    But, like the owner of a foul disease,
    To keep it from divulging, let 
it feed
    Even on the pith of life. Where is he gone?
  Queen. To draw apart the body he hath ki
ll'd;
    O'er whom his very madness, like some ore
    Among a mineral of metals base,
    Shows
 itself pure. He weeps for what is done.
  King. O Gertrude, come away!
    The sun no sooner shal
l the mountains touch
    But we will ship him hence; and this vile deed
    We must with all our 
majesty and skill
    Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!

             Enter Rosencra
ntz and Guildenstern.

    Friends both, go join you with some further aid.
    Hamlet in madness
 hath Polonius slain,
    And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him.
    Go seek him out; s
peak fair, and bring the body
    Into the chapel. I pray you haste in this.
                     
     Exeunt [Rosencrantz and Guildenstern].
    Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends
 
   And let them know both what we mean to do
    And what's untimely done. [So haply slander-]
   
 Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter,
    As level as the cannon to his blank,
    Transports 
his poisoned shot- may miss our name
    And hit the woundless air.- O, come away!
    My soul is 
full of discord and dismay.
                                                         Exeunt.





Scene II.
Elsinore. A passage in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Safely stow'd.
  Gentle
men. (within) Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!
  Ham. But soft! What noise? Who calls on Hamlet? O, here they

come.

               Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Ros. What have you done, my lord, w
ith the dead body?
  Ham. Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
  Ros. Tell us where 'tis, th
at we may take it thence
    And bear it to the chapel.
  Ham. Do not believe it.
  Ros. Believe 
what?
  Ham. That I can keep your counsel, and not mine own. Besides,
to be
    demanded of a spo
nge, what replication should be made by the
son
    of a king?
  Ros. Take you me for a sponge, m
y lord?
  Ham. Ay, sir; that soaks up the King's countenance, his
rewards,
    his authorities. B
ut such officers do the King best service
in
    the end. He keeps them, like an ape, in the corne
r of his
jaw;
    first mouth'd, to be last swallowed. When he needs what you
have
    glean'd, 
it is but squeezing you and, sponge, you shall be
dry
    again.
  Ros. I understand you not, my 
lord.
  Ham. I am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.
  Ros. My lord, you must t
ell us where the body is and go with us
to
    the King.
  Ham. The body is with the King, but th
e King is not with the
body.
    The King is a thing-
  Guil. A thing, my lord?
  Ham. Of nothin
g. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.
                                                      
   Exeunt.




Scene III.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King.

  King. I have sen
t to seek him and to find the body.
    How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
    Yet must
 not we put the strong law on him.
    He's lov'd of the distracted multitude,
    Who like not in
 their judgment, but their eyes;
    And where 'tis so, th' offender's scourge is weigh'd,
    But
 never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,
    This sudden sending him away must seem
    De
liberate pause. Diseases desperate grown
    By desperate appliance are reliev'd,
    Or not at al
l.

                    Enter Rosencrantz.

    How now O What hath befall'n?
  Ros. Where the 
dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
    We cannot get from him.
  King. But where is he?
  Ros. Witho
ut, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
  King. Bring him before us.
  Ros. Ho, Guildenstern!
 Bring in my lord.

        Enter Hamlet and Guildenstern [with Attendants].

  King. Now, Hamle
t, where's Polonius?
  Ham. At supper.
  King. At supper? Where?
  Ham. Not where he eats, but wh
ere he is eaten. A certain
    convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your worm is
your
  
  only emperor for diet. We fat all creatures else to fat us,
and
    we fat ourselves for maggots
. Your fat king and your lean
beggar
    is but variable service- two dishes, but to one table. Th
at's
the
    end.
  King. Alas, alas!
  Ham. A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a kin
g, and
eat
    of the fish that hath fed of that worm.
  King. What dost thou mean by this?
  Ha
m. Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress
through
    the guts of a beggar.
  King.
 Where is Polonius?
  Ham. In heaven. Send thither to see. If your messenger find him
not
    the
re, seek him i' th' other place yourself. But indeed, if
you
    find him not within this month, y
ou shall nose him as you go
up
    the stair, into the lobby.
  King. Go seek him there. [To Atte
ndants.]
  Ham. He will stay till you come.
                                            [Exeunt At
tendants.]
  King. Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,-
    Which we do tender as we dea
rly grieve
    For that which thou hast done,- must send thee hence
    With fiery quickness. Ther
efore prepare thyself.
    The bark is ready and the wind at help,
    Th' associates tend, and ev
erything is bent
    For England.
  Ham. For England?
  King. Ay, Hamlet.
  Ham. Good.
  King. 
So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
  Ham. I see a cherub that sees them. But come, for England
!
    Farewell, dear mother.
  King. Thy loving father, Hamlet.
  Ham. My mother! Father and moth
er is man and wife; man and wife
is
    one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England!
Exit.
 
 King. Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard.
    Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-ni
ght.
    Away! for everything is seal'd and done
    That else leans on th' affair. Pray you make 
haste.
                            Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]
    And, England, if my lo
ve thou hold'st at aught,-
    As my great power thereof may give thee sense,
    Since yet thy ci
catrice looks raw and red
    After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
    Pays homage to us,- tho
u mayst not coldly set
    Our sovereign process, which imports at full,
    By letters congruing 
to that effect,
    The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;
    For like the hectic in my blo
od he rages,
    And thou must cure me. Till I know 'tis done,
    Howe'er my haps, my joys were n
e'er begun.             Exit.

Scene IV.
Near Elsinore.

Enter Fortinbras wit
h his Army over the stage.

  For. Go, Captain, from me greet the Danish king.
    Tell him that 
by his license Fortinbras
    Craves the conveyance of a promis'd march
    Over his kingdom. You 
know the rendezvous.
    If that his Majesty would aught with us,
    We shall express our duty in
 his eye;
    And let him know so.
  Capt. I will do't, my lord.
  For. Go softly on.
          
                         Exeunt [all but the Captain].

       Enter Hamlet, Rosencrantz, [Guilden
stern,] and others.

  Ham. Good sir, whose powers are these?
  Capt. They are of Norway, sir.
 
 Ham. How purpos'd, sir, I pray you?
  Capt. Against some part of Poland.
  Ham. Who commands them
, sir?
  Capt. The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.
  Ham. Goes it against the main of Poland, si
r,
    Or for some frontier?
  Capt. Truly to speak, and with no addition,
    We go to gain a li
ttle patch of ground
    That hath in it no profit but the name.
    To pay five ducats, five, I w
ould not farm it;
    Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
    A ranker rate, should it be sold
 in fee.
  Ham. Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
  Capt. Yes, it is already garrison'd.

  Ham. Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
    Will not debate the question of this stra
w.
    This is th' imposthume of much wealth and peace,
    That inward breaks, and shows no cause
 without
    Why the man dies.- I humbly thank you, sir.
  Capt. God b' wi' you, sir.             
                [Exit.]
  Ros. Will't please you go, my lord?
  Ham. I'll be with you straight. Go
 a little before.
                                        [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]
    How all occ
asions do inform against me
    And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
    If his chief good and
 market of his time
    Be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.
    Sure he that made us with 
such large discourse,
    Looking before and after, gave us not
    That capability and godlike re
ason
    To fust in us unus'd. Now, whether it be
    Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple
  
  Of thinking too precisely on th' event,-
    A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom

    And ever three parts coward,- I do not know
    Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do,'

    Sith I have cause, and will, and strength, and means
    To do't. Examples gross as earth exhor
t me.
    Witness this army of such mass and charge,
    Led by a delicate and tender prince,
   
 Whose spirit, with divine ambition puff'd,
    Makes mouths at the invisible event,
    Exposing 
what is mortal and unsure
    To all that fortune, death, and danger dare,
    Even for an eggshel
l. Rightly to be great
    Is not to stir without great argument,
    But greatly to find quarrel 
in a straw
    When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,
    That have a father kill'd, a moth
er stain'd,
    Excitements of my reason and my blood,
    And let all sleep, while to my shame I 
see
    The imminent death of twenty thousand men
    That for a fantasy and trick of fame
    Go
 to their graves like beds, fight for a plot
    Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
    Whi
ch is not tomb enough and continent
    To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,
    My thought
s be bloody, or be nothing worth!            Exit.

Scene V.
Elsinore. A room i
n the Castle.

Enter Horatio, Queen, and a Gentleman.

  Queen. I will not speak with her.
  Ge
nt. She is importunate, indeed distract.
    Her mood will needs be pitied.
  Queen. What would sh
e have?
  Gent. She speaks much of her father; says she hears
    There's tricks i' th' world, and
 hems, and beats her heart;
    Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,
    That carry
 but half sense. Her speech is nothing,
    Yet the unshaped use of it doth move
    The hearers t
o collection; they aim at it,
    And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;
    Which, as 
her winks and nods and gestures yield them,
    Indeed would make one think there might be thought,

    Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
  Hor. 'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may
 strew
    Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.
  Queen. Let her come in.
               
                                [Exit Gentleman.]
    [Aside] To my sick soul (as sin's true nature
 is)
    Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
    So full of artless jealousy is guilt
  
  It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.

                 Enter Ophelia distracted.

  Oph. W
here is the beauteous Majesty of Denmark?
  Queen. How now, Ophelia?
  Oph. (sings)
         How 
should I your true-love know
           From another one?
         By his cockle bat and' staff
 
          And his sandal shoon.

  Queen. Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
  Oph. Say yo
u? Nay, pray You mark.

    (Sings) He is dead and gone, lady,
              He is dead and gone;

            At his head a grass-green turf,
              At his heels a stone.

    O, ho!
  
Queen. Nay, but Ophelia-
  Oph. Pray you mark.

    (Sings) White his shroud as the mountain snow
-

                    Enter King.

  Queen. Alas, look here, my lord!
  Oph. (Sings)
        
   Larded all with sweet flowers;
         Which bewept to the grave did not go
           With tr
ue-love showers.

  King. How do you, pretty lady?
  Oph. Well, God dild you! They say the owl wa
s a baker's
daughter.
    Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be. God
be at
    
your table!
  King. Conceit upon her father.
  Oph. Pray let's have no words of this; but when the
y ask, you
what
    it means, say you this:

    (Sings) To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,
  
            All in the morning bedtime,
            And I a maid at your window,
              To 
be your Valentine.

            Then up he rose and donn'd his clo'es
              And dupp'd th
e chamber door,
            Let in the maid, that out a maid
              Never departed more.


  King. Pretty Ophelia!
  Oph. Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't!

    [Sings] 
By Gis and by Saint Charity,
              Alack, and fie for shame!
            Young men will do
't if they come to't
              By Cock, they are to blame.

            Quoth she, 'Before yo
u tumbled me,
              You promis'd me to wed.'

    He answers:

            'So would I 
'a' done, by yonder sun,
              An thou hadst not come to my bed.'

  King. How long hath 
she been thus?
  Oph. I hope all will be well. We must be patient; but I cannot
    choose but wee
p to think they would lay him i' th' cold
ground.
    My brother shall know of it; and so I thank 
you for your good
    counsel. Come, my coach! Good night, ladies. Good night,
sweet
    ladies. 
Good night, good night.                         Exit
  King. Follow her close; give her good watch,
 I pray you.
                                                 [Exit Horatio.]

    O, this is the
 poison of deep grief; it springs
    All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
    When 
sorrows come, they come not single spies.
    But in battalions! First, her father slain;
    Next
, your son gone, and he most violent author
    Of his own just remove; the people muddied,
    Th
ick and and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers
    For good Polonius' death, and we have do
ne but greenly
    In hugger-mugger to inter him; poor Ophelia
    Divided from herself and her fa
ir judgment,
    Without the which we are pictures or mere beasts;
    Last, and as much containin
g as all these,
    Her brother is in secret come from France;
    And wants not buzzers to infect
 his ear
    Feeds on his wonder, keep, himself in clouds,
    With pestilent speeches of his fath
er's death,
    Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
    Will nothing stick our person to arraig
n
    In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
    Like to a murd'ring piece, in many places
   
 Give me superfluous death.                  A noise within.
  Queen. Alack, what noise is this?
 
 King. Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.

                     Enter a Messenger.


    What is the matter?
  Mess. Save Yourself, my lord:
    The ocean, overpeering of his list,

    Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
    Than Young Laertes, in a riotous head,
    O'
erbears Your offices. The rabble call him lord;
    And, as the world were now but to begin,
    A
ntiquity forgot, custom not known,
    The ratifiers and props of every word,
    They cry 'Choose
 we! Laertes shall be king!'
    Caps, hands, and tongues applaud it to the clouds,
    'Laertes s
hall be king! Laertes king!'
                                                 A noise within.
  Qu
een. How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!
    O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!
  
King. The doors are broke.

                    Enter Laertes with others.

  Laer. Where is thi
s king?- Sirs, staid you all without.
  All. No, let's come in!
  Laer. I pray you give me leave.

  All. We will, we will!
  Laer. I thank you. Keep the door.      [Exeunt his Followers.]
    O t
hou vile king,
    Give me my father!
  Queen. Calmly, good Laertes.
  Laer. That drop of blood t
hat's calm proclaims me bastard;
    Cries cuckold to my father; brands the harlot
    Even here b
etween the chaste unsmirched brows
    Of my true mother.
  King. What is the cause, Laertes,
   
 That thy rebellion looks so giantlike?
    Let him go, Gertrude. Do not fear our person.
    Ther
e's such divinity doth hedge a king
    That treason can but peep to what it would,
    Acts littl
e of his will. Tell me, Laertes,
    Why thou art thus incens'd. Let him go, Gertrude.
    Speak, 
man.
  Laer. Where is my father?
  King. Dead.
  Queen. But not by him!
  King. Let him demand h
is fill.
  Laer. How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
    To hell, allegiance! vows, to the
 blackest devil
    Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
    I dare damnation. To this po
int I stand,
    That both the world, I give to negligence,
    Let come what comes; only I'll be 
reveng'd
    Most throughly for my father.
  King. Who shall stay you?
  Laer. My will, not all t
he world!
    And for my means, I'll husband them so well
    They shall go far with little.
  Ki
ng. Good Laertes,
    If you desire to know the certainty
    Of your dear father's death, is't wr
it in your revenge
    That sweepstake you will draw both friend and foe,
    Winner and loser?
 
 Laer. None but his enemies.
  King. Will you know them then?
  Laer. To his good friends thus wid
e I'll ope my arms
    And, like the kind life-rend'ring pelican,
    Repast them with my blood.

  King. Why, now You speak
    Like a good child and a true gentleman.
    That I am guiltless of 
your father's death,
    And am most sensibly in grief for it,
    It shall as level to your judgm
ent pierce
    As day does to your eye.
                              A noise within: 'Let her com
e in.'
  Laer. How now? What noise is that?

                      Enter Ophelia.

    O heat, 
dry up my brains! Tears seven times salt
    Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!
    By hea
ven, thy madness shall be paid by weight
    Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!
    Dear
 maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
    O heavens! is't possible a young maid's wits
    Should be 
as mortal as an old man's life?
    Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,
    It sends some
 precious instance of itself
    After the thing it loves.

  Oph. (sings)
         They bore hi
m barefac'd on the bier
           (Hey non nony, nony, hey nony)
         And in his grave rain'd
 many a tear.

    Fare you well, my dove!
  Laer. Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade reveng
e,
    It could not move thus.
  Oph. You must sing 'A-down a-down, and you call him a-down-a.'
O
,
    how the wheel becomes it! It is the false steward, that stole
his
    master's daughter.
 
 Laer. This nothing's more than matter.
  Oph. There's rosemary, that's for remembrance. Pray you, 
love,
    remember. And there is pansies, that's for thoughts.
  Laer. A document in madness! Thou
ghts and remembrance fitted.
  Oph. There's fennel for you, and columbines. There's rue for
you,

    and here's some for me. We may call it herb of grace o'
Sundays.
    O, you must wear your rue
 with a difference! There's a daisy.
I
    would give you some violets, but they wither'd all when
 my
father
    died. They say he made a good end.

    [Sings] For bonny sweet Robin is all my j
oy.

  Laer. Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,
    She turns to favour and to prettin
ess.
  Oph. (sings)
         And will he not come again?
         And will he not come again?
  
         No, no, he is dead;
           Go to thy deathbed;
         He never will come again.


         His beard was as white as snow,
         All flaxen was his poll.
           He is gone, 
he is gone,
           And we cast away moan.
         God 'a'mercy on his soul!

    And of all
 Christian souls, I pray God. God b' wi' you.
Exit.
  Laer. Do you see this, O God?
  King. Laert
es, I must commune with your grief,
    Or you deny me right. Go but apart,
    Make choice of who
m your wisest friends you will,
    And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me.
    If by dir
ect or by collateral hand
    They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,
    Our crown, our l
ife, and all that we call ours,
    To you in satisfaction; but if not,
    Be you content to lend
 your patience to us,
    And we shall jointly labour with your soul
    To give it due content.

  Laer. Let this be so.
    His means of death, his obscure funeral-
    No trophy, sword, nor hat
chment o'er his bones,
    No noble rite nor formal ostentation,-
    Cry to be heard, as 'twere f
rom heaven to earth,
    That I must call't in question.
  King. So you shall;
    And where th' 
offence is let the great axe fall.
    I pray you go with me.
                                    
                      Exeunt

Scene VI.
Elsinore. Another room in the Castle.


Enter Horatio with an Attendant.

  Hor. What are they that would speak with me?
  Servant. Sea
faring men, sir. They say they have letters for
you.
  Hor. Let them come in.
                   
                            [Exit Attendant.]
    I do not know from what part of the world
    I 
should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.

                          Enter Sailors.

  Sailor.
 God bless you, sir.
  Hor. Let him bless thee too.
  Sailor. 'A shall, sir, an't please him. Ther
e's a letter for
you,
    sir,- it comes from th' ambassador that was bound for
England- if
    
your name be Horatio, as I am let to know it is.
  Hor. (reads the letter) 'Horatio, when thou shal
t have
overlook'd
    this, give these fellows some means to the King. They have
    letters for 
him. Ere we were two days old at sea, a pirate of

    very warlike appointment gave us chase. Fin
ding ourselves too
    slow of sail, we put on a compelled valour, and in the
grapple I
    board
ed them. On the instant they got clear of our ship; so I
    alone became their prisoner. They have
 dealt with me like
thieves
    of mercy; but they knew what they did: I am to do a good turn
for

    them. Let the King have the letters I have sent, and repair
thou
    to me with as much spee
d as thou wouldst fly death. I have
words
    to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb; yet are t
hey much
too
    light for the bore of the matter. These good fellows will
bring
    thee where 
I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their
course
    for England. Of them I have much to tell 
thee. Farewell.
                            'He that thou knowest thine, HAMLET.'

    Come, I wi
ll give you way for these your letters,
    And do't the speedier that you may direct me
    To hi
m from whom you brought them.                   Exeunt.

nother room in the Castle.

Enter King and Laertes.

  King. Now must your conscience my acquitt
ance seal,
    And You must put me in your heart for friend,
    Sith you have heard, and with a k
nowing ear,
    That he which hath your noble father slain
    Pursued my life.
  Laer. It well a
ppears. But tell me
    Why you proceeded not against these feats
    So crimeful and so capital i
n nature,
    As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
    You mainly were stirr'd up.
  King.
 O, for two special reasons,
    Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,
    But yet to me
 they are strong. The Queen his mother
    Lives almost by his looks; and for myself,-
    My virt
ue or my plague, be it either which,-
    She's so conjunctive to my life and soul
    That, as th
e star moves not but in his sphere,
    I could not but by her. The other motive
    Why to a publ
ic count I might not go
    Is the great love the general gender bear him,
    Who, dipping all hi
s faults in their affection,
    Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
    Convert hi
s gives to graces; so that my arrows,
    Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,
    Would have
 reverted to my bow again,
    And not where I had aim'd them.
  Laer. And so have I a noble fathe
r lost;
    A sister driven into desp'rate terms,
    Whose worth, if praises may go back again,

    Stood challenger on mount of all the age
    For her perfections. But my revenge will come.
  
King. Break not your sleeps for that. You must not think
    That we are made of stuff so flat and 
dull
    That we can let our beard be shook with danger,
    And think it pastime. You shortly sha
ll hear more.
    I lov'd your father, and we love ourself,
    And that, I hope, will teach you t
o imagine-

                 Enter a Messenger with letters.

    How now? What news?
  Mess. L
etters, my lord, from Hamlet:
    This to your Majesty; this to the Queen.
  King. From Hamlet? Wh
o brought them?
  Mess. Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not.
    They were given me by Clau
dio; he receiv'd them
    Of him that brought them.
  King. Laertes, you shall hear them.
    Lea
ve us.
                                                 Exit Messenger.
    [Reads]'High and Might
y,-You shall know I am set naked on
your
    kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see your king
ly eyes;
    when I shall (first asking your pardon thereunto) recount the
    occasion of my sudd
en and more strange return.
                                                     'HAMLET.'
    Wha
t should this mean? Are all the rest come back?
    Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?
  Laer
. Know you the hand?
  King. 'Tis Hamlet's character. 'Naked!'
    And in a postscript here, he sa
ys 'alone.'
    Can you advise me?
  Laer. I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come!
    It war
ms the very sickness in my heart
    That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,
    'Thus didest
 thou.'
  King. If it be so, Laertes
    (As how should it be so? how otherwise?),
    Will you b
e rul'd by me?
  Laer. Ay my lord,
    So you will not o'errule me to a peace.
  King. To thine o
wn peace. If he be now return'd
    As checking at his voyage, and that he means
    No more to un
dertake it, I will work him
    To exploit now ripe in my device,
    Under the which he shall not
 choose but fall;
    And for his death no wind shall breathe
    But even his mother shall unchar
ge the practice
    And call it accident.
  Laer. My lord, I will be rul'd;
    The rather, if yo
u could devise it so
    That I might be the organ.
  King. It falls right.
    You have been tal
k'd of since your travel much,
    And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality
    Wherein they sa
y you shine, Your sum of parts
    Did not together pluck such envy from him
    As did that one; 
and that, in my regard,
    Of the unworthiest siege.
  Laer. What part is that, my lord?
  King.
 A very riband in the cap of youth-
    Yet needfull too; for youth no less becomes
    The light 
and careless livery that it wears
    Than settled age his sables and his weeds,
    Importing hea
lth and graveness. Two months since
    Here was a gentleman of Normandy.
    I have seen myself, 
and serv'd against, the French,
    And they can well on horseback; but this gallant
    Had witch
craft in't. He grew unto his seat,
    And to such wondrous doing brought his horse
    As had he 
been incorps'd and demi-natur'd
    With the brave beast. So far he topp'd my thought
    That I, 
in forgery of shapes and tricks,
    Come short of what he did.
  Laer. A Norman was't?
  King. A
 Norman.
  Laer. Upon my life, Lamound.
  King. The very same.
  Laer. I know him well. He is the
 broach indeed
    And gem of all the nation.
  King. He made confession of you;
    And gave you
 such a masterly report
    For art and exercise in your defence,
    And for your rapier most esp
ecially,
    That he cried out 'twould be a sight indeed
    If one could match you. The scrimers 
of their nation
    He swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
    If you oppos'd them. Sir, thi
s report of his
    Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
    That he could nothing do but wish and 
beg
    Your sudden coming o'er to play with you.
    Now, out of this-
  Laer. What out of this,
 my lord?
  King. Laertes, was your father dear to you?
    Or are you like the painting of a sorr
ow,
    A face without a heart,'
  Laer. Why ask you this?
  King. Not that I think you did not l
ove your father;
    But that I know love is begun by time,
    And that I see, in passages of pro
of,
    Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
    There lives within the very flame of love
  
  A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
    And nothing is at a like goodness still;
    For
 goodness, growing to a plurisy,
    Dies in his own too-much. That we would do,
    We should do 
when we would; for this 'would' changes,
    And hath abatements and delays as many
    As there a
re tongues, are hands, are accidents;
    And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
    T
hat hurts by easing. But to the quick o' th' ulcer!
    Hamlet comes back. What would you undertake

    To show yourself your father's son in deed
    More than in words?
  Laer. To cut his throat
 i' th' church!
  King. No place indeed should murther sanctuarize;
    Revenge should have no bou
nds. But, good Laertes,
    Will you do this? Keep close within your chamber.
    Hamlet return'd 
shall know you are come home.
    We'll put on those shall praise your excellence
    And set a do
uble varnish on the fame
    The Frenchman gave you; bring you in fine together
    And wager on y
our heads. He, being remiss,
    Most generous, and free from all contriving,
    Will not peruse 
the foils; so that with ease,
    Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
    A sword unbated, 
and, in a pass of practice,
    Requite him for your father.
  Laer. I will do't!
    And for tha
t purpose I'll anoint my sword.
    I bought an unction of a mountebank,
    So mortal that, but d
ip a knife in it,
    Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
    Collected from all simples th
at have virtue
    Under the moon, can save the thing from death
    This is but scratch'd withal.
 I'll touch my point
    With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
    It may be death.

  King. Let's further think of this,
    Weigh what convenience both of time and means
    May fit
 us to our shape. If this should fall,
    And that our drift look through our bad performance.
  
  'Twere better not assay'd. Therefore this project
    Should have a back or second, that might ho
ld
    If this did blast in proof. Soft! let me see.
    We'll make a solemn wager on your cunning
s-
    I ha't!
    When in your motion you are hot and dry-
    As make your bouts more violent t
o that end-
    And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepar'd him
    A chalice for the nonce; w
hereon but sipping,
    If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
    Our purpose may hold there.
- But stay, what noise,

                           Enter Queen.

    How now, sweet queen?
  Q
ueen. One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
    So fast they follow. Your sister's drown'd, Laert
es.
  Laer. Drown'd! O, where?
  Queen. There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
    That shows hi
s hoar leaves in the glassy stream.
    There with fantastic garlands did she come
    Of crowflow
ers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,
    That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
    But o
ur cold maids do dead men's fingers call them.
    There on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds
 
   Clamb'ring to hang, an envious sliver broke,
    When down her weedy trophies and herself
    F
ell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide
    And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up;

    Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes,
    As one incapable of her own distress,
    O
r like a creature native and indued
    Unto that element; but long it could not be
    Till that 
her garments, heavy with their drink,
    Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay
    To mud
dy death.
  Laer. Alas, then she is drown'd?
  Queen. Drown'd, drown'd.
  Laer. Too much of water
 hast thou, poor Ophelia,
    And therefore I forbid my tears; but yet
    It is our trick; nature
 her custom holds,
    Let shame say what it will. When these are gone,
    The woman will be out.
 Adieu, my lord.
    I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze
    But that this folly douts 
it.                          Exit.
  King. Let's follow, Gertrude.
    How much I had to do to cal
m his rage I
    Now fear I this will give it start again;
    Therefore let's follow.
          
                                               Exeunt.

ACT V. Scene I.
Elsinor
e. A churchyard.

Enter two Clowns, [with spades and pickaxes].

  Clown. Is she to be buried in
 Christian burial when she
wilfully
    seeks her own salvation?
  Other. I tell thee she is; the
refore make her grave straight.
    The crowner hath sate on her, and finds it Christian burial.
 
 Clown. How can that be, unless she drown'd herself in her own
    defence?
  Other. Why, 'tis fou
nd so.
  Clown. It must be se offendendo; it cannot be else. For here
lies
    the point: if I dr
own myself wittingly, it argues an act; and
an
    act hath three branches-it is to act, to do, an
d to perform;
    argal, she drown'd herself wittingly.
  Other. Nay, but hear you, Goodman Delver
!
  Clown. Give me leave. Here lies the water; good. Here stands
the
    man; good. If the man go
 to this water and drown himself, it
is,
    will he nill he, he goes- mark you that. But if the w
ater
come to
    him and drown him, he drowns not himself. Argal, he that is
not
    guilty of h
is own death shortens not his own life.
  Other. But is this law?
  Clown. Ay, marry, is't- crowne
r's quest law.
  Other. Will you ha' the truth an't? If this had not been a
    gentlewoman, she s
hould have been buried out o' Christian
burial.
  Clown. Why, there thou say'st! And the more pity
 that great
folk
    should have count'nance in this world to drown or hang
themselves
    more 
than their even-Christian. Come, my spade! There is no
    ancient gentlemen but gard'ners, ditcher
s, and grave-makers.
They
    hold up Adam's profession.
  Other. Was he a gentleman?
  Clown. '
A was the first that ever bore arms.
  Other. Why, he had none.
  Clown. What, art a heathen? How 
dost thou understand the
Scripture?
    The Scripture says Adam digg'd. Could he dig without arms?

I'll
    put another question to thee. If thou answerest me not to the
    purpose, confess thys
elf-
  Other. Go to!
  Clown. What is he that builds stronger than either the mason,
the
    shi
pwright, or the carpenter?
  Other. The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand
    tena
nts.
  Clown. I like thy wit well, in good faith. The gallows does
well.
    But how does it well
? It does well to those that do ill. Now,
    thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger th
an the
    church. Argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To't again,
come!
  Other. Who builds 
stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a
    carpenter?
  Clown. Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
 
 Other. Marry, now I can tell!
  Clown. To't.
  Other. Mass, I cannot tell.

                 En
ter Hamlet and Horatio afar off.

  Clown. Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull ass

will
    not mend his pace with beating; and when you are ask'd this
    question next, say 'a gra
ve-maker.' The houses he makes lasts
    till doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan; fetch me a stoup o
f
    liquor.
                                            [Exit Second Clown.]


              
         [Clown digs and] sings.

       In youth when I did love, did love,
         Methought i
t was very sweet;
       To contract- O- the time for- a- my behove,
         O, methought there- 
a- was nothing- a- meet.

  Ham. Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings
at
  
  grave-making?
  Hor. Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.
  Ham. 'Tis e'en so. The
 hand of little employment hath the
daintier
    sense.
  Clown. (sings)
         But age with h
is stealing steps
           Hath clawed me in his clutch,
         And hath shipped me intil the 
land,
           As if I had never been such.
                                            [Throws 
up a skull.]

  Ham. That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once. How
the
    knave jowls
 it to the ground,as if 'twere Cain's jawbone,
that
    did the first murther! This might be the p
ate of a
Politician,
    which this ass now o'erreaches; one that would circumvent
God,
    migh
t it not?
  Hor. It might, my lord.
  Ham. Or of a courtier, which could say 'Good morrow, sweet

lord!
    How dost thou, good lord?' This might be my Lord Such-a-one,
that
    prais'd my Lord S
uch-a-one's horse when he meant to beg it-
might
    it not?
  Hor. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Why, e'e
n so! and now my Lady Worm's, chapless, and
knock'd
    about the mazzard with a sexton's spade. H
ere's fine
revolution,
    and we had the trick to see't. Did these bones cost no more
the
    b
reeding but to play at loggets with 'em? Mine ache to think
    on't.
  Clown. (Sings)
         A
 pickaxe and a spade, a spade,
           For and a shrouding sheet;
         O, a Pit of clay for
 to be made
           For such a guest is meet.
                                      Throws up [
another skull].

  Ham. There's another. Why may not that be the skull of a
lawyer?
    Where be
 his quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, his
tenures,
    and his tricks? Why does he suffer th
is rude knave now to
knock
    him about the sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell
him
 
   of his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be in's time
a
    great buyer of land, with h
is statutes, his recognizances,
his
    fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries. Is this the fi
ne
of
    his fines, and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his
fine
    pate full of fine 
dirt? Will his vouchers vouch him no more
of
    his purchases, and double ones too, than the leng
th and
breadth
    of a pair of indentures? The very conveyances of his lands
will
    scarcely 
lie in this box; and must th' inheritor himself have
no
    more, ha?
  Hor. Not a jot more, my l
ord.
  Ham. Is not parchment made of sheepskins?
  Hor. Ay, my lord, And of calveskins too.
  Ham
. They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in
that. I
    will speak to this fellow. Who
se grave's this, sirrah?
  Clown. Mine, sir.

    [Sings] O, a pit of clay for to be made
      
        For such a guest is meet.

  Ham. I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in't.
  Clow
n. You lie out on't, sir, and therefore 'tis not yours.
    For my part, I do not lie in't, yet it 
is mine.
  Ham. Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine. 'Tis
for
    the dead, not fo
r the quick; therefore thou liest.
  Clown. 'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away again from me to you
.
  Ham. What man dost thou dig it for?
  Clown. For no man, sir.
  Ham. What woman then?
  Clow
n. For none neither.
  Ham. Who is to be buried in't?
  Clown. One that was a woman, sir; but, res
t her soul, she's
dead.
  Ham. How absolute the knave is! We must speak by the card, or
    equiv
ocation will undo us. By the Lord, Horatio, this three
years
    I have taken note of it, the age 
is grown so picked that the
toe
    of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he
gall
s
    his kibe.- How long hast thou been a grave-maker?
  Clown. Of all the days i' th' year, I ca
me to't that day that
our
    last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.
  Ham. How long is that since
?
  Clown. Cannot you tell that? Every fool can tell that. It was
the
    very day that young Ham
let was born- he that is mad, and sent
    into England.
  Ham. Ay, marry, why was be sent into En
gland?
  Clown. Why, because 'a was mad. 'A shall recover his wits
there;
    or, if 'a do not, '
tis no great matter there.
  Ham. Why?
  Clown. 'Twill not he seen in him there. There the men are
 as
mad as
    he.
  Ham. How came he mad?
  Clown. Very strangely, they say.
  Ham. How strang
ely?
  Clown. Faith, e'en with losing his wits.
  Ham. Upon what ground?
  Clown. Why, here in De
nmark. I have been sexton here, man and
boy
    thirty years.
  Ham. How long will a man lie i' t
h' earth ere he rot?
  Clown. Faith, if 'a be not rotten before 'a die (as we have
many
    pocky
 corses now-a-days that will scarce hold the laying in,
I
    will last you some eight year or nin
e year. A tanner will
last
    you nine year.
  Ham. Why he more than another?
  Clown. Why, sir
, his hide is so tann'd with his trade that 'a
will
    keep out water a great while; and your wat
er is a sore
decayer of
    your whoreson dead body. Here's a skull now. This skull hath
lien
  
  you i' th' earth three-and-twenty years.
  Ham. Whose was it?
  Clown. A whoreson, mad fellow's 
it was. Whose do you think it
was?
  Ham. Nay, I know not.
  Clown. A pestilence on him for a mad
 rogue! 'A pour'd a flagon
of
    Rhenish on my head once. This same skull, sir, was Yorick's
   
 skull, the King's jester.
  Ham. This?
  Clown. E'en that.
  Ham. Let me see. [Takes the skull.]
 Alas, poor Yorick! I knew
him,
    Horatio. A fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy.

He
    hath borne me on his back a thousand times. And now how
abhorred
    in my imagination it 
is! My gorge rises at it. Here hung
those
    lips that I have kiss'd I know not how oft. Where be
 your
gibes
    now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment that
    were wont to se
t the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock
your
    own grinning? Quite chap- fall'n? Now get you
 to my lady's
    chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this
    favour she must 
come. Make her laugh at that. Prithee,
Horatio,
    tell me one thing.
  Hor. What's that, my lor
d?
  Ham. Dost thou think Alexander look'd o' this fashion i' th'
earth?
  Hor. E'en so.
  Ham. 
And smelt so? Pah!
                                          [Puts down the skull.]
  Hor. E'en so
, my lord.
  Ham. To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not
    imagination trace the 
noble dust of Alexander till he find it
    stopping a bunghole?
  Hor. 'Twere to consider too cur
iously, to consider so.
  Ham. No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with
modesty
    e
nough, and likelihood to lead it; as thus: Alexander died,
    Alexander was buried, Alexander retu
rneth into dust; the dust
is
    earth; of earth we make loam; and why of that loam (whereto
he

    was converted) might they not stop a beer barrel?
    Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay
,
    Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.
    O, that that earth which kept the world in awe

    Should patch a wall t' expel the winter's flaw!
    But soft! but soft! aside! Here comes the 
King-

    Enter [priests with] a coffin [in funeral procession], King,
             Queen, Laert
es, with Lords attendant.]

    The Queen, the courtiers. Who is this they follow?
    And with s
uch maimed rites? This doth betoken
    The corse they follow did with desp'rate hand
    Fordo it
 own life. 'Twas of some estate.
    Couch we awhile, and mark.
                                  
       [Retires with Horatio.]

  Laer. What ceremony else?
  Ham. That is Laertes,
    A very n
oble youth. Mark.
  Laer. What ceremony else?
  Priest. Her obsequies have been as far enlarg'd
 
   As we have warranty. Her death was doubtful;
    And, but that great command o'ersways the order
,
    She should in ground unsanctified have lodg'd
    Till the last trumpet. For charitable pray
ers,
    Shards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on her.
    Yet here she is allow'd her virg
in rites,
    Her maiden strewments, and the bringing home
    Of bell and burial.
  Laer. Must t
here no more be done?
  Priest. No more be done.
    We should profane the service of the dead
  
  To sing a requiem and such rest to her
    As to peace-parted souls.
  Laer. Lay her i' th' eart
h;
    And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
    May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest
,
    A minist'ring angel shall my sister be
    When thou liest howling.
  Ham. What, the fair O
phelia?
  Queen. Sweets to the sweet! Farewell.
                                             [Scat
ters flowers.]
    I hop'd thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
    I thought thy bride-bed t
o have deck'd, sweet maid,
    And not have strew'd thy grave.
  Laer. O, treble woe
    Fall ten
 times treble on that cursed head
    Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
    Depriv'd thee
 of! Hold off the earth awhile,
    Till I have caught her once more in mine arms.
               
                              Leaps in the grave.
    Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead
 
   Till of this flat a mountain you have made
    T' o'ertop old Pelion or the skyish head
    Of 
blue Olympus.
  Ham. [comes forward] What is he whose grief
    Bears such an emphasis? whose phra
se of sorrow
    Conjures the wand'ring stars, and makes them stand
    Like wonder-wounded hearer
s? This is I,
    Hamlet the Dane.                    [Leaps in after Laertes.
  Laer. The devil t
ake thy soul!
                                            [Grapples with him].
  Ham. Thou pray'st
 not well.
    I prithee take thy fingers from my throat;
    For, though I am not splenitive and 
rash,
    Yet have I in me something dangerous,
    Which let thy wisdom fear. Hold off thy hand!

  King. Pluck them asunder.
  Queen. Hamlet, Hamlet!
  All. Gentlemen!
  Hor. Good my lord, be q
uiet.
             [The Attendants part them, and they come out of the
                           
                              grave.]
  Ham. Why, I will fight with him upon this theme
    Until 
my eyelids will no longer wag.
  Queen. O my son, what theme?
  Ham. I lov'd Ophelia. Forty thousa
nd brothers
    Could not (with all their quantity of love)
    Make up my sum. What wilt thou do 
for her?
  King. O, he is mad, Laertes.
  Queen. For love of God, forbear him!
  Ham. 'Swounds, s
how me what thou't do.
    Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?
    Woo't drin
k up esill? eat a crocodile?
    I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?
    To outface me with l
eaping in her grave?
    Be buried quick with her, and so will I.
    And if thou prate of mountai
ns, let them throw
    Millions of acres on us, till our ground,
    Singeing his pate against the
 burning zone,
    Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
    I'll rant as well as thou.
 
 Queen. This is mere madness;
    And thus a while the fit will work on him.
    Anon, as patient 
as the female dove
    When that her golden couplets are disclos'd,
    His silence will sit droop
ing.
  Ham. Hear you, sir!
    What is the reason that you use me thus?
    I lov'd you ever. But
 it is no matter.
    Let Hercules himself do what he may,
    The cat will mew, and dog will have
 his day.
Exit.
  King. I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.
                               
                    Exit Horatio.
    [To Laertes] Strengthen your patience in our last night's
sp
eech.
    We'll put the matter to the present push.-
    Good Gertrude, set some watch over your s
on.-
    This grave shall have a living monument.
    An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
    
Till then in patience our proceeding be.
                                                         E

Scene II.
Elsinore. A hall in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet and Horatio.

  Ham. So
 much for this, sir; now shall you see the other.
    You do remember all the circumstance?
  Hor.
 Remember it, my lord!
  Ham. Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting
    That would not let
 me sleep. Methought I lay
    Worse than the mutinies in the bilboes. Rashly-
    And prais'd be 
rashness for it; let us know,
    Our indiscretion sometime serves us well
    When our deep plots
 do pall; and that should learn us
    There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
    Rough-hew them
 how we will-
  Hor. That is most certain.
  Ham. Up from my cabin,
    My sea-gown scarf'd about
 me, in the dark
    Grop'd I to find out them; had my desire,
    Finger'd their packet, and in f
ine withdrew
    To mine own room again; making so bold
    (My fears forgetting manners) to unsea
l
    Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio
    (O royal knavery!), an exact command,
  
  Larded with many several sorts of reasons,
    Importing Denmark's health, and England's too,
  
  With, hoo! such bugs and goblins in my life-
    That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
    N
o, not to stay the finding of the axe,
    My head should be struck off.
  Hor. Is't possible?
  
Ham. Here's the commission; read it at more leisure.
    But wilt thou bear me how I did proceed?

  Hor. I beseech you.
  Ham. Being thus benetted round with villanies,
    Or I could make a prolo
gue to my brains,
    They had begun the play. I sat me down;
    Devis'd a new commission; wrote 
it fair.
    I once did hold it, as our statists do,
    A baseness to write fair, and labour'd mu
ch
    How to forget that learning; but, sir, now
    It did me yeoman's service. Wilt thou know

    Th' effect of what I wrote?
  Hor. Ay, good my lord.
  Ham. An earnest conjuration from the Ki
ng,
    As England was his faithful tributary,
    As love between them like the palm might flouri
sh,
    As peace should still her wheaten garland wear
    And stand a comma 'tween their amities,

    And many such-like as's of great charge,
    That, on the view and knowing of these contents,

    Without debatement further, more or less,
    He should the bearers put to sudden death,
   
 Not shriving time allow'd.
  Hor. How was this seal'd?
  Ham. Why, even in that was heaven ordina
nt.
    I had my father's signet in my purse,
    Which was the model of that Danish seal;
    Fo
lded the writ up in the form of th' other,
    Subscrib'd it, gave't th' impression, plac'd it safe
ly,
    The changeling never known. Now, the next day
    Was our sea-fight; and what to this was 
sequent
    Thou know'st already.
  Hor. So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.
  Ham. Why, man
, they did make love to this employment!
    They are not near my conscience; their defeat
    Doe
s by their own insinuation grow.
    'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
    Between the pa
ss and fell incensed points
    Of mighty opposites.
  Hor. Why, what a king is this!
  Ham. Does
 it not, thinks't thee, stand me now upon-
    He that hath kill'd my king, and whor'd my mother;

    Popp'd in between th' election and my hopes;
    Thrown out his angle for my proper life,
    
And with such coz'nage- is't not perfect conscience
    To quit him with this arm? And is't not to 
be damn'd
    To let this canker of our nature come
    In further evil?
  Hor. It must be shortl
y known to him from England
    What is the issue of the business there.
  Ham. It will be short; 
the interim is mine,
    And a man's life is no more than to say 'one.'
    But I am very sorry, g
ood Horatio,
    That to Laertes I forgot myself,
    For by the image of my cause I see
    The 
portraiture of his. I'll court his favours.
    But sure the bravery of his grief did put me
    I
nto a tow'ring passion.
  Hor. Peace! Who comes here?

                 Enter young Osric, a cour
tier.

  Osr. Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
  Ham. I humbly thank you, sir. [As
ide to Horatio] Dost know this
    waterfly?
  Hor. [aside to Hamlet] No, my good lord.
  Ham. [a
side to Horatio] Thy state is the more gracious; for
'tis a
    vice to know him. He hath much lan
d, and fertile. Let a beast
be
    lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at the king's mess.
'
Tis
    a chough; but, as I say, spacious in the possession of dirt.

  Osr. Sweet lord, if your 
lordship were at leisure, I should
impart
    a thing to you from his Majesty.
  Ham. I will rece
ive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit. Put
your
    bonnet to his right use. 'Tis for the head
.
  Osr. I thank your lordship, it is very hot.
  Ham. No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is
 northerly.
  Osr. It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
  Ham. But yet methinks it is very sul
try and hot for my
complexion.
  Osr. Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry, as 'twere- I
canno
t
    tell how. But, my lord, his Majesty bade me signify to you
that
    he has laid a great wag
er on your head. Sir, this is the
matter-
  Ham. I beseech you remember.
                        
   [Hamlet moves him to put on his hat.]
  Osr. Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith. Si
r, here
is
    newly come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute
gentleman,
    full of most 
excellent differences, of very soft society and
    great showing. Indeed, to speak feelingly of hi
m, he is the
card
    or calendar of gentry; for you shall find in him the
continent of
    what
 part a gentleman would see.
  Ham. Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you; though, I

 
   know, to divide him inventorially would dozy th' arithmetic
of
    memory, and yet but yaw neit
her in respect of his quick sail.
    But, in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of

great
    article, and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as, to
make
    true diction of h
im, his semblable is his mirror, and who
else
    would trace him, his umbrage, nothing more.
  O
sr. Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
  Ham. The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the ge
ntleman in our
more
    rawer breath?
  Osr. Sir?
  Hor [aside to Hamlet] Is't not possible to u
nderstand in
another
    tongue? You will do't, sir, really.
  Ham. What imports the nomination o
f this gentleman?
  Osr. Of Laertes?
  Hor. [aside] His purse is empty already. All's golden words
 are
    spent.
  Ham. Of him, sir.
  Osr. I know you are not ignorant-
  Ham. I would you did, 
sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would
not
    much approve me. Well, sir?
  Osr. You are not i
gnorant of what excellence Laertes is-
  Ham. I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with h
im in
    excellence; but to know a man well were to know himself.
  Osr. I mean, sir, for his wea
pon; but in the imputation laid on
him
    by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.
  Ham. What's hi
s weapon?
  Osr. Rapier and dagger.
  Ham. That's two of his weapons- but well.
  Osr. The King, 
sir, hath wager'd with him six Barbary horses;
    against the which he has impon'd, as I take it, 
six French
    rapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers,
and
    so. Three of
 the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy,
    very responsive to the hilts, most delicate c
arriages, and of
    very liberal conceit.
  Ham. What call you the carriages?
  Hor. [aside to H
amlet] I knew you must be edified by the
margent
    ere you had done.
  Osr. The carriages, sir,
 are the hangers.
  Ham. The phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could
    carry cann
on by our sides. I would it might be hangers till
then.
    But on! Six Barbary horses against six
 French swords, their
    assigns, and three liberal-conceited carriages: that's the
French
    b
et against the Danish. Why is this all impon'd, as you call
it?
  Osr. The King, sir, hath laid th
at, in a dozen passes between
    yourself and him, he shall not exceed you three hits; he hath
  
  laid on twelve for nine, and it would come to immediate trial
    if your lordship would vouchsaf
e the answer.
  Ham. How if I answer no?
  Osr. I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in 
trial.
  Ham. Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please his
Majesty,
    it is the breathin
g time of day with me. Let the foils be
    brought, the gentleman willing, and the King hold his

purpose,
    I will win for him if I can; if not, I will gain nothing but
my
    shame and the od
d hits.
  Osr. Shall I redeliver you e'en so?
  Ham. To this effect, sir, after what flourish your
 nature will.
  Osr. I commend my duty to your lordship.
  Ham. Yours, yours. [Exit Osric.] He doe
s well to commend it
    himself; there are no tongues else for's turn.
  Hor. This lapwing runs a
way with the shell on his head.
  Ham. He did comply with his dug before he suck'd it. Thus has
he
,
    and many more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age
dotes
    on, only got the tune o
f the time and outward habit of
encounter-
    a kind of yesty collection, which carries them thro
ugh and
    through the most fann'd and winnowed opinions; and do but
blow
    them to their tria
l-the bubbles are out,

                            Enter a Lord.

  Lord. My lord, his Majesty 
commended him to you by young Osric,
who
    brings back to him, that you attend him in the hall. 
He sends
to
    know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you
will
    take longe
r time.
  Ham. I am constant to my purposes; they follow the King's
pleasure.
    If his fitness 
speaks, mine is ready; now or whensoever,
provided
    I be so able as now.
  Lord. The King and 
Queen and all are coming down.
  Ham. In happy time.
  Lord. The Queen desires you to use some gen
tle entertainment to
    Laertes before you fall to play.
  Ham. She well instructs me.
         
                                           [Exit Lord.]
  Hor. You will lose this wager, my lord.

  Ham. I do not think so. Since he went into France I have been
in
    continual practice. I shall
 win at the odds. But thou wouldst
not
    think how ill all's here about my heart. But it is no m
atter.
  Hor. Nay, good my lord -
  Ham. It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gaingiving as

    would perhaps trouble a woman.
  Hor. If your mind dislike anything, obey it. I will forestal
l
their
    repair hither and say you are not fit.
  Ham. Not a whit, we defy augury; there's a s
pecial providence
in
    the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not to come; if it
be
    not
 to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will
come:
    the readiness is all. Since no m
an knows aught of what he
leaves,
    what is't to leave betimes? Let be.

    Enter King, Queen
, Laertes, Osric, and Lords, with other
              Attendants with foils and gauntlets.
       
        A table and flagons of wine on it.

  King. Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me
.
                    [The King puts Laertes' hand into Hamlet's.]
  Ham. Give me your pardon, sir
. I have done you wrong;
    But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.
    This presence knows,
    A
nd you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd
    With sore distraction. What I have done
    Th
at might your nature, honour, and exception
    Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
    Wa
s't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet.
    If Hamlet from himself be taken away,
    And when h
e's not himself does wrong Laertes,
    Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
    Who does it
, then? His madness. If't be so,
    Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
    His madness is 
poor Hamlet's enemy.
    Sir, in this audience,
    Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd evil
    F
ree me so far in your most generous thoughts
    That I have shot my arrow o'er the house
    And 
hurt my brother.
  Laer. I am satisfied in nature,
    Whose motive in this case should stir me mo
st
    To my revenge. But in my terms of honour
    I stand aloof, and will no reconcilement
    
Till by some elder masters of known honour
    I have a voice and precedent of peace
    To keep m
y name ungor'd. But till that time
    I do receive your offer'd love like love,
    And will not 
wrong it.
  Ham. I embrace it freely,
    And will this brother's wager frankly play.
    Give us
 the foils. Come on.
  Laer. Come, one for me.
  Ham. I'll be your foil, Laertes. In mine ignoranc
e
    Your skill shall, like a star i' th' darkest night,
    Stick fiery off indeed.
  Laer. You
 mock me, sir.
  Ham. No, by this hand.
  King. Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,

    You know the wager?
  Ham. Very well, my lord.
    Your Grace has laid the odds o' th' weaker 
side.
  King. I do not fear it, I have seen you both;
    But since he is better'd, we have theref
ore odds.
  Laer. This is too heavy; let me see another.
  Ham. This likes me well. These foils ha
ve all a length?
                                                Prepare to play.
  Osr. Ay, my go
od lord.
  King. Set me the stoups of wine upon that table.
    If Hamlet give the first or second
 hit,
    Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
    Let all the battlements their ordnance fire
;
    The King shall drink to Hamlet's better breath,
    And in the cup an union shall he throw

    Richer than that which four successive kings
    In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups
;
    And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
    The trumpet to the cannoneer without,
    The 
cannons to the heavens, the heaven to earth,
    'Now the King drinks to Hamlet.' Come, begin.
   
 And you the judges, bear a wary eye.
  Ham. Come on, sir.
  Laer. Come, my lord.                 
               They play.
  Ham. One.
  Laer. No.
  Ham. Judgment!
  Osr. A hit, a very palpable
 hit.
  Laer. Well, again!
  King. Stay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
    Here's t
o thy health.
               [Drum; trumpets sound; a piece goes off [within].
    Give him the cu
p.
  Ham. I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile.
    Come. (They play.) Another hit. What sa
y you?
  Laer. A touch, a touch; I do confess't.
  King. Our son shall win.
  Queen. He's fat, an
d scant of breath.
    Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows.
    The Queen carouses to thy 
fortune, Hamlet.
  Ham. Good madam!
  King. Gertrude, do not drink.
  Queen. I will, my lord; I p
ray you pardon me.          Drinks.
  King. [aside] It is the poison'd cup; it is too late.
  Ham.
 I dare not drink yet, madam; by-and-by.
  Queen. Come, let me wipe thy face.
  Laer. My lord, I'l
l hit him now.
  King. I do not think't.
  Laer. [aside] And yet it is almost against my conscienc
e.
  Ham. Come for the third, Laertes! You but dally.
    Pray you pass with your best violence;

    I am afeard you make a wanton of me.
  Laer. Say you so? Come on.                              
 Play.
  Osr. Nothing neither way.
  Laer. Have at you now!
                [Laertes wounds Hamle
t; then] in scuffling, they
                    change rapiers, [and Hamlet wounds Laertes].
  Kin
g. Part them! They are incens'd.
  Ham. Nay come! again!                         The Queen falls.


  Osr. Look to the Queen there, ho!
  Hor. They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?
  Osr. 
How is't, Laertes?
  Laer. Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric.
    I am justly kill'd w
ith mine own treachery.
  Ham. How does the Queen?
  King. She sounds to see them bleed.
  Queen.
 No, no! the drink, the drink! O my dear Hamlet!
    The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.          
       [Dies.]
  Ham. O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd.
    Treachery! Seek it out.
        
                                        [Laertes falls.]
  Laer. It is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou a
rt slain;
    No medicine in the world can do thee good.
    In thee there is not half an hour of 
life.
    The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
    Unbated and envenom'd. The foul practice

    Hath turn'd itself on me. Lo, here I lie,
    Never to rise again. Thy mother's poison'd.
   
 I can no more. The King, the King's to blame.
  Ham. The point envenom'd too?
    Then, venom, to
 thy work.                    Hurts the King.
  All. Treason! treason!
  King. O, yet defend me, f
riends! I am but hurt.
  Ham. Here, thou incestuous, murd'rous, damned Dane,
    Drink off this po
tion! Is thy union here?
    Follow my mother.                                 King dies.
  Laer. 
He is justly serv'd.
    It is a poison temper'd by himself.
    Exchange forgiveness with me, nob
le Hamlet.
    Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
    Nor thine on me!                
                       Dies.
  Ham. Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.
    I am dead, Hor
atio. Wretched queen, adieu!
    You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
    That are but m
utes or audience to this act,
    Had I but time (as this fell sergeant, Death,
    Is strict in h
is arrest) O, I could tell you-
    But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;
    Thou liv'st; report me 
and my cause aright
    To the unsatisfied.
  Hor. Never believe it.
    I am more an antique Rom
an than a Dane.
    Here's yet some liquor left.
  Ham. As th'art a man,
    Give me the cup. Let
 go! By heaven, I'll ha't.
    O good Horatio, what a wounded name
    (Things standing thus unkno
wn) shall live behind me!
    If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,
    Absent thee from felici
ty awhile,
    And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
    To tell my story.         [Mar
ch afar off, and shot within.]
    What warlike noise is this?
  Osr. Young Fortinbras, with conqu
est come from Poland,
    To the ambassadors of England gives
    This warlike volley.
  Ham. O, 
I die, Horatio!
    The potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit.
    I cannot live to hear the new
s from England,
    But I do prophesy th' election lights
    On Fortinbras. He has my dying voice
.
    So tell him, with th' occurrents, more and less,
    Which have solicited- the rest is silen
ce.             Dies.
  Hor. Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince,
    And flights o
f angels sing thee to thy rest!
                                                 [March within.]
 
   Why does the drum come hither?

    Enter Fortinbras and English Ambassadors, with Drum,
     
             Colours, and Attendants.

  Fort. Where is this sight?
  Hor. What is it you will se
e?
    If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
  Fort. This quarry cries on havoc. O proud D
eath,
    What feast is toward in thine eternal cell
    That thou so many princes at a shot
    
So bloodily hast struck.
  Ambassador. The sight is dismal;
    And our affairs from England come 
too late.
    The ears are senseless that should give us hearing
    To tell him his commandment i
s fulfill'd
    That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.
    Where should we have our thanks?

  Hor. Not from his mouth,
    Had it th' ability of life to thank you.
    He never gave commandm
ent for their death.
    But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
    You from the Polack war
s, and you from England,
    Are here arriv'd, give order that these bodies
    High on a stage be
 placed to the view;
    And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
    How these things came abo
ut. So shall you hear
    Of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts;
    Of accidental judgments, casua
l slaughters;
    Of deaths put on by cunning and forc'd cause;
    And, in this upshot, purposes 
mistook
    Fall'n on th' inventors' heads. All this can I
    Truly deliver.
  Fort. Let us hast
e to hear it,
    And call the noblest to the audience.
    For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortu
ne.
    I have some rights of memory in this kingdom
    Which now, to claim my vantage doth invit
e me.
  Hor. Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
    And from his mouth whose voice will dra
w on more.
    But let this same be presently perform'd,
    Even while men's minds are wild, lest
 more mischance
    On plots and errors happen.
  Fort. Let four captains
    Bear Hamlet like a 
soldier to the stage;
    For he was likely, had he been put on,
    To have prov'd most royally; 
and for his passage
    The soldiers' music and the rites of war
    Speak loudly for him.
    Ta
ke up the bodies. Such a sight as this
    Becomes the field but here shows much amiss.
    Go, bi
d the soldiers shoot.
            Exeunt marching; after the which a peal of ordnance
            
                                       are shot off.

ACT I. Scene I.
Elsinore. A platform before the Castle.

Enter two Sentinels-[first,] F
rancisco, [who paces up and down
at his post; then] Bernardo, [who approaches him].

  Ber. Who's
 there?
  Fran. Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.
  Ber. Long live the King!
  Fran. Ber
nardo?
  Ber. He.
  Fran. You come most carefully upon your hour.
  Ber. 'Tis now struck twelve. 
Get thee to bed, Francisco.
  Fran. For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold,
    And I am si
ck at heart.
  Ber. Have you had quiet guard?
  Fran. Not a mouse stirring.
  Ber. Well, good nig
ht.
    If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
    The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.


                    Enter Horatio and Marcellus.

  Fran. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is t
here?
  Hor. Friends to this ground.
  Mar. And liegemen to the Dane.
  Fran. Give you good night
.
  Mar. O, farewell, honest soldier.
    Who hath reliev'd you?
  Fran. Bernardo hath my place.

    Give you good night.                                   Exit.
  Mar. Holla, Bernardo!
  Ber. S
ay-
    What, is Horatio there ?
  Hor. A piece of him.
  Ber. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Ma
rcellus.
  Mar. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
  Ber. I have seen nothing.
  Mar. 
Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
    And will not let belief take hold of him
    Touching this 
dreaded sight, twice seen of us.
    Therefore I have entreated him along,
    With us to watch th
e minutes of this night,
    That, if again this apparition come,
    He may approve our eyes and 
speak to it.
  Hor. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
  Ber. Sit down awhile,
    And let us once ag
ain assail your ears,
    That are so fortified against our story,
    What we two nights have see
n.
  Hor. Well, sit we down,
    And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
  Ber. Last night of all
,
    When yond same star that's westward from the pole
    Had made his course t' illume that par
t of heaven
    Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
    The bell then beating one-

      
                  Enter Ghost.

  Mar. Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!
  Ber. I
n the same figure, like the King that's dead.
  Mar. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
  B
er. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.
  Hor. Most like. It harrows me with fear and won
der.
  Ber. It would be spoke to.
  Mar. Question it, Horatio.
  Hor. What art thou that usurp'st
 this time of night
    Together with that fair and warlike form
    In which the majesty of burie
d Denmark
    Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!
  Mar. It is offended.
  Ber. S
ee, it stalks away!
  Hor. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!
                              
                       Exit Ghost.
  Mar. 'Tis gone and will not answer.
  Ber. How now, Horatio? 
You tremble and look pale.
    Is not this something more than fantasy?
    What think you on't?

  Hor. Before my God, I might not this believe
    Without the sensible and true avouch
    Of min
e own eyes.
  Mar. Is it not like the King?
  Hor. As thou art to thyself.
    Such was the very 
armour he had on
    When he th' ambitious Norway combated.
    So frown'd he once when, in an ang
ry parle,
    He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
    'Tis strange.
  Mar. Thus twice before
, and jump at this dead hour,
    With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
  Hor. In what par
ticular thought to work I know not;
    But, in the gross and scope of my opinion,
    This bodes 
some strange eruption to our state.
  Mar. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows,
    Why 
this same strict and most observant watch
    So nightly toils the subject of the land,
    And wh
y such daily cast of brazen cannon
    And foreign mart for implements of war;
    Why such impres
s of shipwrights, whose sore task
    Does not divide the Sunday from the week.
    What might be 
toward, that this sweaty haste
    Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day?
    Who is't t
hat can inform me?
  Hor. That can I.
    At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
    Whose
 image even but now appear'd to us,
    Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
    Thereto pri
ck'd on by a most emulate pride,
    Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet
    (For so 
this side of our known world esteem'd him)
    Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,

    Well ratified by law and heraldry,
    Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
    Wh
ich he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror;
    Against the which a moiety competent
    Was gaged b
y our king; which had return'd
    To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
    Had he been vanquisher, a
s, by the same cov'nant
    And carriage of the article design'd,
    His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir
, young Fortinbras,
    Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
    Hath in the skirts of Norway, here 
and there,
    Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
    For food and diet, to some enterprise

    That hath a stomach in't; which is no other,
    As it doth well appear unto our state,
    Bu
t to recover of us, by strong hand
    And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
    So by his 
father lost; and this, I take it,
    Is the main motive of our preparations,
    The source of th
is our watch, and the chief head
    Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
  Ber. I think it 
be no other but e'en so.
    Well may it sort that this portentous figure
    Comes armed through 
our watch, so like the King
    That was and is the question of these wars.
  Hor. A mote it is to
 trouble the mind's eye.
    In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
    A little ere the mighti
est Julius fell,
    The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead
    Did squeak and gibber i
n the Roman streets;
    As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood,
    Disasters in the sun
; and the moist star
    Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
    Was sick almost to dooms
day with eclipse.
    And even the like precurse of fierce events,
    As harbingers preceding sti
ll the fates
    And prologue to the omen coming on,
    Have heaven and earth together demonstrat
ed
    Unto our climature and countrymen.

                      Enter Ghost again.

    But so
ft! behold! Lo, where it comes again!
    I'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!
     
                                          Spreads his arms.
    If thou hast any sound, or use of v
oice,
    Speak to me.
    If there be any good thing to be done,
    That may to thee do ease, a
nd, race to me,
    Speak to me.
    If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
    Which happily f
oreknowing may avoid,
    O, speak!
    Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
    Extorted treasu
re in the womb of earth
    (For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death),
                
                                 The cock crows.
    Speak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcel
lus!
  Mar. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
  Hor. Do, if it will not stand.
  Ber. 'Tis h
ere!
  Hor. 'Tis here!
  Mar. 'Tis gone!
                                                     Exi
t Ghost.
    We do it wrong, being so majestical,
    To offer it the show of violence;
    For i
t is as the air, invulnerable,
    And our vain blows malicious mockery.
  Ber. It was about to sp
eak, when the cock crew.
  Hor. And then it started, like a guilty thing
    Upon a fearful summon
s. I have heard
    The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
    Doth with his lofty and shrill-
sounding throat
    Awake the god of day; and at his warning,
    Whether in sea or fire, in earth
 or air,
    Th' extravagant and erring spirit hies
    To his confine; and of the truth herein
 
   This present object made probation.
  Mar. It faded on the crowing of the cock.
    Some say th
at ever, 'gainst that season comes
    Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
    The bird of 
dawning singeth all night long;
    And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,
    The nights
 are wholesome, then no planets strike,
    No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
    So 
hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
  Hor. So have I heard and do in part believe it.
    But lo
ok, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
    Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.
    Break w
e our watch up; and by my advice
    Let us impart what we have seen to-night
    Unto young Hamle
t; for, upon my life,
    This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
    Do you consent we shall 
acquaint him with it,
    As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
    Let's do't, I pray; and I
 this morning know
    Where we shall find him most conveniently.           Exeunt.




Scene 
II.
Elsinore. A room of state in the Castle.

Flourish. [Enter Claudius, King of Denmark, Gertrud
e the Queen,
Hamlet,
Polonius, Laertes and his sister Ophelia, [Voltemand, Cornelius,]
Lords Atte
ndant.

  King. Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
    The memory be green, and that i
t us befitted
    To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom
    To be contracted in one b
row of woe,
    Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
    That we with wisest sorrow think
 on him
    Together with remembrance of ourselves.
    Therefore our sometime sister, now our que
en,
    Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,
    Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,

    With an auspicious, and a dropping eye,
    With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,

    In equal scale weighing delight and dole,
    Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd
    Y
our better wisdoms, which have freely gone
    With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
    No
w follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
    Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
    Or think
ing by our late dear brother's death
    Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
    Colleagued
 with this dream of his advantage,
    He hath not fail'd to pester us with message
    Importing 
the surrender of those lands
    Lost by his father, with all bands of law,
    To our most valian
t brother. So much for him.
    Now for ourself and for this time of meeting.
    Thus much the bu
siness is: we have here writ
    To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,
    Who, impotent and bedri
d, scarcely hears
    Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress
    His further gait herein, in th
at the levies,
    The lists, and full proportions are all made
    Out of his subject; and we her
e dispatch
    You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,
    For bearers of this greeting to old No
rway,
    Giving to you no further personal power
    To business with the King, more than the sco
pe
    Of these dilated articles allow.            [Gives a paper.]
    Farewell, and let your has
te commend your duty.
  Cor., Volt. In that, and all things, will we show our duty.
  King. We dou
bt it nothing. Heartily farewell.
                                 Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius.

    And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
    You told us of some suit. What is't, Laertes?

    You cannot speak of reason to the Dane
    And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes
,
    That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
    The head is not more native to the heart,
 
   The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
    Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
    W
hat wouldst thou have, Laertes?
  Laer. My dread lord,
    Your leave and favour to return to Fran
ce;
    From whence though willingly I came to Denmark
    To show my duty in your coronation,
  
  Yet now I must confess, that duty done,
    My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
    
And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
  King. Have you your father's leave? What says Pol
onius?
  Pol. He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
    By laboursome petition, and at las
t
    Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent.
    I do beseech you give him leave to go.
  King. 
Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,
    And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
    But 
now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son-
  Ham. [aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind!
  Ki
ng. How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
  Ham. Not so, my lord. I am too much i' th' sun.

  Queen. Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
    And let thine eye look like a friend on Den
mark.
    Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
    Seek for thy noble father in the dust.
    Tho
u know'st 'tis common. All that lives must die,
    Passing through nature to eternity.
  Ham. Ay,
 madam, it is common.
  Queen. If it be,
    Why seems it so particular with thee?
  Ham. Seems, 
madam, Nay, it is. I know not 'seems.'
    'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
    Nor cust
omary suits of solemn black,
    Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,
    No, nor the fruitful 
river in the eye,
    Nor the dejected havior of the visage,
    Together with all forms, moods, s
hapes of grief,
    'That can denote me truly. These indeed seem,
    For they are actions that a 
man might play;
    But I have that within which passeth show-
    These but the trappings and the
 suits of woe.
  King. 'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
    To give these mourni
ng duties to your father;
    But you must know, your father lost a father;
    That father lost, 
lost his, and the survivor bound
    In filial obligation for some term
    To do obsequious sorro
w. But to persever
    In obstinate condolement is a course
    Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unma
nly grief;
    It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
    A heart unfortified, a mind impatient
,
    An understanding simple and unschool'd;
    For what we know must be, and is as common
    
As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
    Why should we in our peevish opposition
    Take it to 
heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
    A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
    To reason
 most absurd, whose common theme
    Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
    From the f
irst corse till he that died to-day,
    'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth
    This un
prevailing woe, and think of us
    As of a father; for let the world take note
    You are the mo
st immediate to our throne,
    And with no less nobility of love
    Than that which dearest fath
er bears his son
    Do I impart toward you. For your intent
    In going back to school in Witten
berg,
    It is most retrograde to our desire;
    And we beseech you, bend you to remain
    Her
e in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
    Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
  Queen. Le
t not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.
    I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.
  H
am. I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
  King. Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.
    Be as
 ourself in Denmark. Madam, come.
    This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet
    Sits smiling t
o my heart; in grace whereof,
    No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day
    But the great ca
nnon to the clouds shall tell,
    And the King's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,
    Respeaki
ng earthly thunder. Come away.
                                Flourish. Exeunt all but Hamlet.
  
Ham. O that this too too solid flesh would melt,
    Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!
    Or t
hat the Everlasting had not fix'd
    His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
    How weary,
 stale, flat, and unprofitable
    Seem to me all the uses of this world!
    Fie on't! ah, fie! '
Tis an unweeded garden
    That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
    Possess it mere
ly. That it should come to this!
    But two months dead! Nay, not so much, not two.
    So excell
ent a king, that was to this
    Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
    That he might not
 beteem the winds of heaven
    Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
    Must I remember?
 Why, she would hang on him
    As if increase of appetite had grown
    By what it fed on; and ye
t, within a month-
    Let me not think on't! Frailty, thy name is woman!-
    A little month, or 
ere those shoes were old
    With which she followed my poor father's body
    Like Niobe, all tea
rs- why she, even she
    (O God! a beast that wants discourse of reason
    Would have mourn'd lo
nger) married with my uncle;
    My father's brother, but no more like my father
    Than I to Her
cules. Within a month,
    Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
    Had left the flushing in
 her galled eyes,
    She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
    With such dexterity to incest
uous sheets!
    It is not, nor it cannot come to good.
    But break my heart, for I must hold my
 tongue!

          Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo.

  Hor. Hail to your lordship!
  Ha
m. I am glad to see you well.
    Horatio!- or I do forget myself.
  Hor. The same, my lord, and y
our poor servant ever.
  Ham. Sir, my good friend- I'll change that name with you.
    And what ma
ke you from Wittenberg, Horatio?
    Marcellus?
  Mar. My good lord!
  Ham. I am very glad to see
 you.- [To Bernardo] Good even, sir.-

    But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
  Hor. A
 truant disposition, good my lord.
  Ham. I would not hear your enemy say so,
    Nor shall you do
 my ear that violence
    To make it truster of your own report
    Against yourself. I know you a
re no truant.
    But what is your affair in Elsinore?
    We'll teach you to drink deep ere you d
epart.
  Hor. My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
  Ham. I prithee do not mock me, fello
w student.
    I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
  Hor. Indeed, my lord, it followed hard
 upon.
  Ham. Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats
    Did coldly furnish forth the ma
rriage tables.
    Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
    Or ever I had seen that day, Horat
io!
    My father- methinks I see my father.
  Hor. O, where, my lord?
  Ham. In my mind's eye, H
oratio.
  Hor. I saw him once. He was a goodly king.
  Ham. He was a man, take him for all in all.

    I shall not look upon his like again.
  Hor. My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
  Ham. 
Saw? who?
  Hor. My lord, the King your father.
  Ham. The King my father?
  Hor. Season your adm
iration for a while
    With an attent ear, till I may deliver
    Upon the witness of these gentl
emen,
    This marvel to you.
  Ham. For God's love let me hear!
  Hor. Two nights together had t
hese gentlemen
    (Marcellus and Bernardo) on their watch
    In the dead vast and middle of the 
night
    Been thus encount'red. A figure like your father,
    Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,

    Appears before them and with solemn march
    Goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walk'd

    By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
    Within his truncheon's length; whilst they dis
till'd
    Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
    Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me

    In dreadful secrecy impart they did,
    And I with them the third night kept the watch;
    W
here, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
    Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
  
  The apparition comes. I knew your father.
    These hands are not more like.
  Ham. But where wa
s this?
  Mar. My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
  Ham. Did you not speak to it?
  Hor
. My lord, I did;
    But answer made it none. Yet once methought
    It lifted up it head and did
 address
    Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
    But even then the morning cock crew lou
d,
    And at the sound it shrunk in haste away
    And vanish'd from our sight.
  Ham. 'Tis very
 strange.
  Hor. As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
    And we did think it writ down in o
ur duty
    To let you know of it.
  Ham. Indeed, indeed, sirs. But this troubles me.
    Hold yo
u the watch to-night?
  Both [Mar. and Ber.] We do, my lord.
  Ham. Arm'd, say you?
  Both. Arm'd
, my lord.
  Ham. From top to toe?
  Both. My lord, from head to foot.
  Ham. Then saw you not hi
s face?
  Hor. O, yes, my lord! He wore his beaver up.
  Ham. What, look'd he frowningly.
  Hor. 
A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
  Ham. Pale or red?
  Hor. Nay, very pale.
  Ham. And
 fix'd his eyes upon you?
  Hor. Most constantly.
  Ham. I would I had been there.
  Hor. It woul
d have much amaz'd you.
  Ham. Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
  Hor. While one with moderat
e haste might tell a hundred.
  Both. Longer, longer.
  Hor. Not when I saw't.
  Ham. His beard w
as grizzled- no?
  Hor. It was, as I have seen it in his life,
    A sable silver'd.
  Ham. I wil
l watch to-night.
    Perchance 'twill walk again.
  Hor. I warr'nt it will.
  Ham. If it assume 
my noble father's person,
    I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
    And bid me hold
 my peace. I pray you all,
    If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
    Let it be tenable in
 your silence still;
    And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
    Give it an understanding but 
no tongue.
    I will requite your loves. So, fare you well.
    Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven 
and twelve,
    I'll visit you.
  All. Our duty to your honour.
  Ham. Your loves, as mine to you
. Farewell.
                                        Exeunt [all but Hamlet].
    My father's spiri
t- in arms? All is not well.
    I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come!
    Till then 
sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,
    Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.

Exit.




Scene III.
Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius.

Enter Laertes and Ophelia.


  Laer. My necessaries are embark'd. Farewell.
    And, sister, as the winds give benefit
    A
nd convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
    But let me hear from you.
  Oph. Do you doubt that?
  L
aer. For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,
    Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood;
    A 
violet in the youth of primy nature,
    Forward, not permanent- sweet, not lasting;
    The perfu
me and suppliance of a minute;
    No more.
  Oph. No more but so?
  Laer. Think it no more.
   
 For nature crescent does not grow alone
    In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,
    The 
inward service of the mind and soul
    Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
    And now n
o soil nor cautel doth besmirch
    The virtue of his will; but you must fear,
    His greatness w
eigh'd, his will is not his own;
    For he himself is subject to his birth.
    He may not, as un
valued persons do,
    Carve for himself, for on his choice depends
    The safety and health of t
his whole state,
    And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd
    Unto the voice and yieldin
g of that body
    Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
    It fits your wisdom s
o far to believe it
    As he in his particular act and place
    May give his saying deed; which 
is no further
    Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
    Then weigh what loss your honour
 may sustain
    If with too credent ear you list his songs,
    Or lose your heart, or your chast
e treasure open
    To his unmast'red importunity.
    Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,

    And keep you in the rear of your affection,
    Out of the shot and danger of desire.
    The
 chariest maid is prodigal enough
    If she unmask her beauty to the moon.
    Virtue itself scop
es not calumnious strokes.
    The canker galls the infants of the spring
    Too oft before their
 buttons be disclos'd,
    And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
    Contagious blastments are m
ost imminent.
    Be wary then; best safety lies in fear.
    Youth to itself rebels, though none 
else near.
  Oph. I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep
    As watchman to my heart. But, go
od my brother,
    Do not as some ungracious pastors do,
    Show me the steep and thorny way to h
eaven,
    Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
    Himself the primrose path of dallianc
e treads
    And recks not his own rede.
  Laer. O, fear me not!

                       Enter P
olonius.

    I stay too long. But here my father comes.
    A double blessing is a double grace;

    Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
  Pol. Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame!
  
  The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
    And you are stay'd for. There- my blessing with t
hee!
    And these few precepts in thy memory
    Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue
,
    Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.
    Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar:
    T
hose friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
    Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of stee
l;
    But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
    Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Bew
are
    Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,
    Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee.
 
   Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice;
    Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgme
nt.
    Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
    But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
 
   For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
    And they in France of the best rank and station
    
Are most select and generous, chief in that.
    Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
    For loan 
oft loses both itself and friend,
    And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
    This above al
l- to thine own self be true,
    And it must follow, as the night the day,
    Thou canst not the
n be false to any man.
    Farewell. My blessing season this in thee!
  Laer. Most humbly do I tak
e my leave, my lord.
  Pol. The time invites you. Go, your servants tend.
  Laer. Farewell, Opheli
a, and remember well
    What I have said to you.
  Oph. 'Tis in my memory lock'd,
    And you yo
urself shall keep the key of it.
  Laer. Farewell.                                          Exit.

  Pol. What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?
  Oph. So please you, something touching the Lord H
amlet.
  Pol. Marry, well bethought!
    'Tis told me he hath very oft of late
    Given private 
time to you, and you yourself
    Have of your audience been most free and bounteous.
    If it be
 so- as so 'tis put on me,
    And that in way of caution- I must tell you
    You do not understa
nd yourself so clearly
    As it behooves my daughter and your honour.
    What is between you? Gi
ve me up the truth.
  Oph. He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
    Of his affection to me.

  Pol. Affection? Pooh! You speak like a green girl,
    Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.

    Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
  Oph. I do not know, my lord, what I should thi
nk,
  Pol. Marry, I will teach you! Think yourself a baby
    That you have ta'en these tenders fo
r true pay,
    Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,
    Or (not to crack the wind
 of the poor phrase,
    Running it thus) you'll tender me a fool.
  Oph. My lord, he hath importu
n'd me with love
    In honourable fashion.
  Pol. Ay, fashion you may call it. Go to, go to!
  O
ph. And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
    With almost all the holy vows of heaven.

  Pol. Ay, springes to catch woodcocks! I do know,
    When the blood burns, how prodigal the sou
l
    Lends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter,
    Giving more light than heat, extinct in b
oth
    Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
    You must not take for fire. From this time

    Be something scanter of your maiden presence.
    Set your entreatments at a higher rate
    T
han a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
    Believe so much in him, that he is young,
    And wi
th a larger tether may he walk
    Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia,
    Do not believe his 
vows; for they are brokers,
    Not of that dye which their investments show,
    But mere implora
tors of unholy suits,
    Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
    The better to beguile. Th
is is for all:
    I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth
    Have you so slander any m
oment leisure
    As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
    Look to't, I charge you. Come
 your ways.
  Oph. I shall obey, my lord.
                                                        
 Exeunt.




Scene IV.
Elsinore. The platform before the Castle.

Enter Hamlet, Horatio, and
 Marcellus.

  Ham. The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
  Hor. It is a nipping and an eager 
air.
  Ham. What hour now?
  Hor. I think it lacks of twelve.
  Mar. No, it is struck.
  Hor. In
deed? I heard it not. It then draws near the season
    Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.

                   A flourish of trumpets, and two pieces go off.
    What does this mean, my lord?

  Ham. The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
    Keeps wassail, and the swagg'ring ups
pring reels,
    And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
    The kettledrum and trumpet th
us bray out
    The triumph of his pledge.
  Hor. Is it a custom?
  Ham. Ay, marry, is't;
    Bu
t to my mind, though I am native here
    And to the manner born, it is a custom
    More honour'd
 in the breach than the observance.
    This heavy-headed revel east and west
    Makes us traduc'
d and tax'd of other nations;
    They clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase
    Soil our addi
tion; and indeed it takes
    From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
    The pith and 
marrow of our attribute.
    So oft it chances in particular men
    That, for some vicious mole o
f nature in them,
    As in their birth,- wherein they are not guilty,
    Since nature cannot cho
ose his origin,-
    By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
    Oft breaking down the pales and for
ts of reason,
    Or by some habit that too much o'erleavens
    The form of plausive manners, tha
t these men
    Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
    Being nature's livery, or fortune's 
star,
    Their virtues else- be they as pure as grace,
    As infinite as man may undergo-
    S
hall in the general censure take corruption
    From that particular fault. The dram of e'il
    D
oth all the noble substance often dout To his own scandal.

                         Enter Ghost.


  Hor. Look, my lord, it comes!
  Ham. Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
    Be thou a s
pirit of health or goblin damn'd,
    Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
    Be
 thy intents wicked or charitable,
    Thou com'st in such a questionable shape
    That I will sp
eak to thee. I'll call thee Hamlet,
    King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me?
    Let me not bur
st in ignorance, but tell
    Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,
    Have burst their cere
ments; why the sepulchre
    Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
    Hath op'd his ponderous and 
marble jaws
    To cast thee up again. What may this mean
    That thou, dead corse, again in comp
lete steel,
    Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
    Making night hideous, and we fools of 
nature
    So horridly to shake our disposition
    With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?

    Say, why is this? wherefore? What should we do?
                                           Gh
ost beckons Hamlet.
  Hor. It beckons you to go away with it,
    As if it some impartment did des
ire
    To you alone.
  Mar. Look with what courteous action
    It waves you to a more removed g
round.
    But do not go with it!
  Hor. No, by no means!
  Ham. It will not speak. Then will I f
ollow it.
  Hor. Do not, my lord!
  Ham. Why, what should be the fear?
    I do not set my life a
t a pin's fee;
    And for my soul, what can it do to that,
    Being a thing immortal as itself?

    It waves me forth again. I'll follow it.
  Hor. What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord
,
    Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
    That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
    And
 there assume some other, horrible form
    Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
    And
 draw you into madness? Think of it.
    The very place puts toys of desperation,
    Without more
 motive, into every brain
    That looks so many fadoms to the sea
    And hears it roar beneath.

  Ham. It waves me still.
    Go on. I'll follow thee.
  Mar. You shall not go, my lord.
  Ham. 
Hold off your hands!
  Hor. Be rul'd. You shall not go.
  Ham. My fate cries out
    And makes ea
ch petty artire in this body
    As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
                            
                    [Ghost beckons.]

    Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
    By heaven,
 I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!-
    I say, away!- Go on. I'll follow thee.
              
                          Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet.
  Hor. He waxes desperate with imagination.
  M
ar. Let's follow. 'Tis not fit thus to obey him.
  Hor. Have after. To what issue will this come?

  Mar. Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
  Hor. Heaven will direct it.
  Mar. Nay, let'
s follow him.
                                                         Exeunt.




Scene V.
E
lsinore. The Castle. Another part of the fortifications.

Enter Ghost and Hamlet.

  Ham. Whithe
r wilt thou lead me? Speak! I'll go no further.
  Ghost. Mark me.
  Ham. I will.
  Ghost. My hour
 is almost come,
    When I to sulph'rous and tormenting flames
    Must render up myself.
  Ham.
 Alas, poor ghost!
  Ghost. Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
    To what I shall unfold.

  Ham. Speak. I am bound to hear.
  Ghost. So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
  Ham. W
hat?
  Ghost. I am thy father's spirit,
    Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
    And 
for the day confin'd to fast in fires,
    Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
    Are 
burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid
    To tell the secrets of my prison house,
    I coul
d a tale unfold whose lightest word
    Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
    Make
 thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
    Thy knotted and combined locks to part,
 
   And each particular hair to stand on end
    Like quills upon the fretful porcupine.
    But th
is eternal blazon must not be
    To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
    If thou did
st ever thy dear father love-
  Ham. O God!
  Ghost. Revenge his foul and most unnatural murther.

  Ham. Murther?
  Ghost. Murther most foul, as in the best it is;
    But this most foul, strange
, and unnatural.
  Ham. Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
    As meditation or the t
houghts of love,
    May sweep to my revenge.
  Ghost. I find thee apt;
    And duller shouldst t
hou be than the fat weed
    That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
    Wouldst thou not stir in
 this. Now, Hamlet, hear.
    'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
    A serpent stung me.
 So the whole ear of Denmark
    Is by a forged process of my death
    Rankly abus'd. But know, t
hou noble youth,
    The serpent that did sting thy father's life
    Now wears his crown.
  Ham.
 O my prophetic soul!
    My uncle?
  Ghost. Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
    With
 witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts-
    O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
   
 So to seduce!- won to his shameful lust
    The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.
    O Ham
let, what a falling-off was there,
    From me, whose love was of that dignity
    That it went ha
nd in hand even with the vow
    I made to her in marriage, and to decline
    Upon a wretch whose
 natural gifts were poor
    To those of mine!
    But virtue, as it never will be mov'd,
    Tho
ugh lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
    So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
    Wil
l sate itself in a celestial bed
    And prey on garbage.
    But soft! methinks I scent the morni
ng air.
    Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
    My custom always of the afternoon,
 
   Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
    With juice of cursed hebona in a vial,
    And in the 
porches of my ears did pour
    The leperous distilment; whose effect
    Holds such an enmity wit
h blood of man
    That swift as quicksilver it courses through
    The natural gates and alleys o
f the body,
    And with a sudden vigour it doth posset
    And curd, like eager droppings into mi
lk,
    The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine;
    And a most instant tetter bark'd about,

    Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust
    All my smooth body.
    Thus was I, sleepi
ng, by a brother's hand
    Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd;
    Cut off even in t
he blossoms of my sin,
    Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd,
    No reckoning made, but sent to 
my account
    With all my imperfections on my head.
  Ham. O, horrible! O, horrible! most horribl
e!
  Ghost. If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.
    Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
   
 A couch for luxury and damned incest.
    But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
    Taint not th
y mind, nor let thy soul contrive
    Against thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven,
    And to th
ose thorns that in her bosom lodge
    To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once.
    The glo
wworm shows the matin to be near
    And gins to pale his uneffectual fire.
    Adieu, adieu, adie
u! Remember me.                      Exit.

  Ham. O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?

    And shall I couple hell? Hold, hold, my heart!
    And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
 
   But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?
    Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
    I
n this distracted globe. Remember thee?
    Yea, from the table of my memory
    I'll wipe away al
l trivial fond records,
    All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past
    That youth and ob
servation copied there,
    And thy commandment all alone shall live
    Within the book and volum
e of my brain,
    Unmix'd with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!
    O most pernicious woman!
    O 
villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
    My tables! Meet it is I set it down
    That one ma
y smile, and smile, and be a villain;
    At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark.        [Write
s.]
    So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word:
    It is 'Adieu, adieu! Remember me.'
    I ha
ve sworn't.
  Hor. (within) My lord, my lord!

                   Enter Horatio and Marcellus.


  Mar. Lord Hamlet!
  Hor. Heaven secure him!
  Ham. So be it!
  Mar. Illo, ho, ho, my lord!
  
Ham. Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.
  Mar. How is't, my noble lord?
  Hor. What news, my lo
rd?
  Mar. O, wonderful!
  Hor. Good my lord, tell it.
  Ham. No, you will reveal it.
  Hor. Not
 I, my lord, by heaven!
  Mar. Nor I, my lord.
  Ham. How say you then? Would heart of man once th
ink it?
    But you'll be secret?
  Both. Ay, by heaven, my lord.
  Ham. There's neer a villain d
welling in all Denmark
    But he's an arrant knave.
  Hor. There needs no ghost, my lord, come fr
om the grave
    To tell us this.
  Ham. Why, right! You are in the right!
    And so, without mo
re circumstance at all,
    I hold it fit that we shake hands and part;
    You, as your business 
and desires shall point you,
    For every man hath business and desire,
    Such as it is; and fo
r my own poor part,
    Look you, I'll go pray.
  Hor. These are but wild and whirling words, my l
ord.
  Ham. I am sorry they offend you, heartily;
    Yes, faith, heartily.
  Hor. There's no off
ence, my lord.
  Ham. Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
    And much offence too. Touc
hing this vision here,
    It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.
    For your desire to kno
w what is between us,
    O'ermaster't as you may. And now, good friends,
    As you are friends, 
scholars, and soldiers,
    Give me one poor request.
  Hor. What is't, my lord? We will.
  Ham. 
Never make known what you have seen to-night.
  Both. My lord, we will not.
  Ham. Nay, but swear'
t.
  Hor. In faith,
    My lord, not I.
  Mar. Nor I, my lord- in faith.
  Ham. Upon my sword.

  Mar. We have sworn, my lord, already.
  Ham. Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.

                 G
host cries under the stage.

  Ghost. Swear.
  Ham. Aha boy, say'st thou so? Art thou there, true
penny?
    Come on! You hear this fellow in the cellarage.
    Consent to swear.
  Hor. Propose t
he oath, my lord.
  Ham. Never to speak of this that you have seen.
    Swear by my sword.
  Ghos
t. [beneath] Swear.
  Ham. Hic et ubique? Then we'll shift our ground.
    Come hither, gentlemen,

    And lay your hands again upon my sword.
    Never to speak of this that you have heard:
    
Swear by my sword.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear by his sword.
  Ham. Well said, old mole! Canst work i
' th' earth so fast?
    A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends."
  Hor. O day and night,
 but this is wondrous strange!
  Ham. And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
    There are m
ore things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
    Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
    But come!

    Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
    How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself
    (A
s I perchance hereafter shall think meet
    To put an antic disposition on),
    That you, at suc
h times seeing me, never shall,
    With arms encumb'red thus, or this head-shake,
    Or by prono
uncing of some doubtful phrase,
    As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'
    O
r 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'
    Or such ambiguous giving out, to note

    That you know aught of me- this is not to do,
    So grace and mercy at your most need help y
ou,
    Swear.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
                                                   [They
 swear.]
  Ham. Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! So, gentlemen,
    With all my love I do commend me 
to you;
    And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
    May do t' express his love and friending to yo
u,
    God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;
    And still your fingers on your lips
, I pray.
    The time is out of joint. O cursed spite
    That ever I was born to set it right!

    Nay, come, let's go together.
                                                         Exeunt.

Act II. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius.

Enter Polonius 
and Reynaldo.

  Pol. Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
  Rey. I will, my lord.
  P
ol. You shall do marvell's wisely, good Reynaldo,
    Before You visit him, to make inquire
    Of
 his behaviour.
  Rey. My lord, I did intend it.
  Pol. Marry, well said, very well said. Look you
, sir,
    Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
    And how, and who, what means, and wher
e they keep,
    What company, at what expense; and finding
    By this encompassment and drift of
 question
    That they do know my son, come you more nearer
    Than your particular demands will
 touch it.
    Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
    As thus, 'I know his father
 and his friends,
    And in part him.' Do you mark this, Reynaldo?
  Rey. Ay, very well, my lord.

  Pol. 'And in part him, but,' you may say, 'not well.
    But if't be he I mean, he's very wild

    Addicted so and so'; and there put on him
    What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank

    As may dishonour him- take heed of that;
    But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips
    
As are companions noted and most known
    To youth and liberty.
  Rey. As gaming, my lord.
  Pol
. Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
    Drabbing. You may go so far.
  Rey. My lord
, that would dishonour him.
  Pol. Faith, no, as you may season it in the charge.
    You must not
 put another scandal on him,
    That he is open to incontinency.
    That's not my meaning. But b
reathe his faults so quaintly
    That they may seem the taints of liberty,
    The flash and outb
reak of a fiery mind,
    A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
    Of general assault.
  Rey. But, 
my good lord-
  Pol. Wherefore should you do this?
  Rey. Ay, my lord,
    I would know that.
  
Pol. Marry, sir, here's my drift,
    And I believe it is a fetch of warrant.
    You laying these
 slight sullies on my son
    As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' th' working,
    Mark you,
   
 Your party in converse, him you would sound,
    Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
    T
he youth you breathe of guilty, be assur'd
    He closes with you in this consequence:
    'Good s
ir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman'-
    According to the phrase or the addition
    Of man an
d country-
  Rey. Very good, my lord.
  Pol. And then, sir, does 'a this- 'a does- What was I abou
t to
say?
    By the mass, I was about to say something! Where did I leave?
  Rey. At 'closes in 
the consequence,' at 'friend or so,' and
    gentleman.'
  Pol. At 'closes in the consequence'- Ay
, marry!
    He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman.
    I saw him yesterday, or t'other day,
    
Or then, or then, with such or such; and, as you say,
    There was 'a gaming; there o'ertook in's 
rouse;
    There falling out at tennis'; or perchance,
    'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'

    Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
    See you now-
    Your bait of falsehood takes this ca
rp of truth;
    And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
    With windlasses and with assays of bia
s,
    By indirections find directions out.
    So, by my former lecture and advice,
    Shall yo
u my son. You have me, have you not?
  Rey. My lord, I have.
  Pol. God b' wi' ye, fare ye well!

  Rey. Good my lord!                                    [Going.]
  Pol. Observe his inclination in 
yourself.
  Rey. I shall, my lord.
  Pol. And let him ply his music.
  Rey. Well, my lord.
  Pol
. Farewell!
                                                  Exit Reynaldo.

                   
    Enter Ophelia.

    How now, Ophelia? What's the matter?
  Oph. O my lord, my lord, I have be
en so affrighted!
  Pol. With what, i' th' name of God?
  Oph. My lord, as I was sewing in my clos
et,
    Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac'd,
    No hat upon his head, his stockings foul'd
,
    Ungart'red, and down-gyved to his ankle;
    Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each othe
r,
    And with a look so piteous in purport
    As if he had been loosed out of hell
    To spea
k of horrors- he comes before me.
  Pol. Mad for thy love?
  Oph. My lord, I do not know,
    But
 truly I do fear it.
  Pol. What said he?
  Oph. He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
    Th
en goes he to the length of all his arm,
    And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
    He f
alls to such perusal of my face
    As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so.
    At last, a little 
shaking of mine arm,
    And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
    He rais'd a sigh so pite
ous and profound
    As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
    And end his being. That done, he l
ets me go,
    And with his head over his shoulder turn'd
    He seem'd to find his way without hi
s eyes,
    For out o' doors he went without their help
    And to the last bended their light on 
me.
  Pol. Come, go with me. I will go seek the King.
    This is the very ecstasy of love,
    W
hose violent property fordoes itself
    And leads the will to desperate undertakings
    As oft a
s any passion under heaven
    That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
    What, have you given
 him any hard words of late?
  Oph. No, my good lord; but, as you did command,
    I did repel his
 letters and denied
    His access to me.
  Pol. That hath made him mad.
    I am sorry that with
 better heed and judgment
    I had not quoted him. I fear'd he did but trifle
    And meant to wr
ack thee; but beshrew my jealousy!
    By heaven, it is as proper to our age
    To cast beyond ou
rselves in our opinions
    As it is common for the younger sort
    To lack discretion. Come, go 
we to the King.
    This must be known; which, being kept close, might move
    More grief to hide
 than hate to utter love.
    Come.
                                                         Exeun

Scene II.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Flourish. [Enter King and Queen, Rosencrantz and
 Guildenstern,
cum aliis.

  King. Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
    Moreover that
 we much did long to see you,
    The need we have to use you did provoke
    Our hasty sending. S
omething have you heard
    Of Hamlet's transformation. So I call it,
    Sith nor th' exterior no
r the inward man
    Resembles that it was. What it should be,
    More than his father's death, t
hat thus hath put him
    So much from th' understanding of himself,
    I cannot dream of. I entr
eat you both
    That, being of so young days brought up with him,
    And since so neighbour'd to
 his youth and haviour,
    That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
    Some little time; s
o by your companies
    To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather
    So much as from occasion yo
u may glean,
    Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus
    That, open'd, lies within our r
emedy.
  Queen. Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,
    And sure I am two men there are no
t living
    To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
    To show us so much gentry and good
 will
    As to expend your time with us awhile
    For the supply and profit of our hope,
    Yo
ur visitation shall receive such thanks
    As fits a king's remembrance.
  Ros. Both your Majesti
es
    Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
    Put your dread pleasures more into comman
d
    Than to entreaty.
  Guil. But we both obey,
    And here give up ourselves, in the full ben
t,
    To lay our service freely at your feet,
    To be commanded.
  King. Thanks, Rosencrantz a
nd gentle Guildenstern.
  Queen. Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz.
    And I beseech yo
u instantly to visit
    My too much changed son.- Go, some of you,
    And bring these gentlemen 
where Hamlet is.
  Guil. Heavens make our presence and our practices
    Pleasant and helpful to h
im!
  Queen. Ay, amen!
                 Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, [with some
         
                                           Attendants].

                         Enter Polonius.


  Pol. Th' ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
    Are joyfully return'd.
  King. Thou still
 hast been the father of good news.
  Pol. Have I, my lord? Assure you, my good liege,
    I hold 
my duty as I hold my soul,
    Both to my God and to my gracious king;
    And I do think- or else
 this brain of mine
    Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
    As it hath us'd to do- that I ha
ve found
    The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
  King. O, speak of that! That do I long to hear.

  Pol. Give first admittance to th' ambassadors.
    My news shall be the fruit to that great feas
t.
  King. Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
                                          
      [Exit Polonius.]
    He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found
    The head and source of
 all your son's distemper.
  Queen. I doubt it is no other but the main,
    His father's death an
d our o'erhasty marriage.
  King. Well, we shall sift him.

              Enter Polonius, Voltema
nd, and Cornelius.

    Welcome, my good friends.
    Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norwa
y?
  Volt. Most fair return of greetings and desires.
    Upon our first, he sent out to suppress

    His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
    To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack,
    Bu
t better look'd into, he truly found
    It was against your Highness; whereat griev'd,
    That s
o his sickness, age, and impotence
    Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
    On Fortinb
ras; which he, in brief, obeys,
    Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,
    Makes vow befor
e his uncle never more
    To give th' assay of arms against your Majesty.
    Whereon old Norway,
 overcome with joy,
    Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee
    And his commission to em
ploy those soldiers,
    So levied as before, against the Polack;
    With an entreaty, herein fur
ther shown,
                                                [Gives a paper.]
    That it might ple
ase you to give quiet pass
    Through your dominions for this enterprise,
    On such regards of 
safety and allowance
    As therein are set down.
  King. It likes us well;
    And at our more c
onsider'd time we'll read,
    Answer, and think upon this business.
    Meantime we thank you for
 your well-took labour.
    Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together.
    Most welcome home!
                       Exeunt Ambassadors.
  Pol. This business is well ended.
    My liege, and m
adam, to expostulate
    What majesty should be, what duty is,
    Why day is day, night is night,
 and time is time.
    Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time.
    Therefore, since brevit
y is the soul of wit,
    And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
    I will be brief. Y
our noble son is mad.
    Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,
    What is't but to be noth
ing else but mad?
    But let that go.
  Queen. More matter, with less art.
  Pol. Madam, I swear
 I use no art at all.
    That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
    And pity 'tis 'tis t
rue. A foolish figure!
    But farewell it, for I will use no art.
    Mad let us grant him then. 
And now remains
    That we find out the cause of this effect-
    Or rather say, the cause of thi
s defect,
    For this effect defective comes by cause.
    Thus it remains, and the remainder thu
s.
    Perpend.
    I have a daughter (have while she is mine),
    Who in her duty and obedience
, mark,
    Hath given me this. Now gather, and surmise.
                                         
    [Reads] the letter.
    'To the celestial, and my soul's idol, the most beautified
      Ophel
ia,'-

    That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is a vile
      phrase.
    But you
 shall hear. Thus:
                                                        [Reads.]
    'In her ex
cellent white bosom, these, &c.'
  Queen. Came this from Hamlet to her?
  Pol. Good madam, stay aw
hile. I will be faithful.     [Reads.]


          'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
            D
oubt that the sun doth move;
          Doubt truth to be a liar;
            But never doubt I lov
e.
      'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers; I have not art
to
    reckon my groans; but 
that I love thee best, O most best,
believe
    it. Adieu.
      'Thine evermore, most dear lady,
 whilst this machine is to
him,

HAMLET.'

    This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me;

    And more above, hath his solicitings,
    As they fell out by time, by means, and place,
    A
ll given to mine ear.
  King. But how hath she
    Receiv'd his love?
  Pol. What do you think of
 me?
  King. As of a man faithful and honourable.
  Pol. I would fain prove so. But what might you
 think,
    When I had seen this hot love on the wing
    (As I perceiv'd it, I must tell you that
,
    Before my daughter told me), what might you,
    Or my dear Majesty your queen here, think,

    If I had play'd the desk or table book,
    Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
    O
r look'd upon this love with idle sight?
    What might you think? No, I went round to work
    An
d my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
    'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star.
    This mu
st not be.' And then I prescripts gave her,
    That she should lock herself from his resort,
    
Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
    Which done, she took the fruits of my advice,
    And 
he, repulsed, a short tale to make,
    Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
    Thence to a wat
ch, thence into a weakness,
    Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
    Into the madne
ss wherein now he raves,
    And all we mourn for.
  King. Do you think 'tis this?
  Queen. it ma
y be, very like.
  Pol. Hath there been such a time- I would fain know that-
    That I have Posit
ively said ''Tis so,'
    When it prov'd otherwise.?
  King. Not that I know.
  Pol. [points to h
is head and shoulder] Take this from this, if
this
      be otherwise.
    If circumstances lead 
me, I will find
    Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
    Within the centre.
  King. 
How may we try it further?
  Pol. You know sometimes he walks for hours together
    Here in the l
obby.
  Queen. So he does indeed.
  Pol. At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him.
    Be you
 and I behind an arras then.
    Mark the encounter. If he love her not,
    And he not from his r
eason fall'n thereon
    Let me be no assistant for a state,
    But keep a farm and carters.
  K
ing. We will try it.

                 Enter Hamlet, reading on a book.

  Queen. But look where
 sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
  Pol. Away, I do beseech you, both away
    I'll board him 
presently. O, give me leave.
                       Exeunt King and Queen, [with Attendants].
    
How does my good Lord Hamlet?
  Ham. Well, God-a-mercy.
  Pol. Do you know me, my lord?
  Ham. Ex
cellent well. You are a fishmonger.
  Pol. Not I, my lord.
  Ham. Then I would you were so honest 
a man.
  Pol. Honest, my lord?
  Ham. Ay, sir. To be honest, as this world goes, is to be one
man

    pick'd out of ten thousand.
  Pol. That's very true, my lord.
  Ham. For if the sun breed ma
ggots in a dead dog, being a god
    kissing carrion- Have you a daughter?
  Pol. I have, my lord.

  Ham. Let her not walk i' th' sun. Conception is a blessing, but
not
    as your daughter may c
onceive. Friend, look to't.
  Pol. [aside] How say you by that? Still harping on my daughter.
Yet

    he knew me not at first. He said I was a fishmonger. He is
far
    gone, far gone! And truly 
in my youth I suff'red much
extremity
    for love- very near this. I'll speak to him again.- What
 do
you
    read, my lord?
  Ham. Words, words, words.
  Pol. What is the matter, my lord?
  Ha
m. Between who?
  Pol. I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
  Ham. Slanders, sir; for the sa
tirical rogue says here that old
men
    have grey beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their ey
es
    purging thick amber and plum-tree gum; and that they have a
    plentiful lack of wit, toge
ther with most weak hams. All
which,
    sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I

hold it
    not honesty to have it thus set down; for you yourself, sir,
    should be old as I 
am if, like a crab, you could go backward.

  Pol. [aside] Though this be madness, yet there is a 
method
in't.-
   Will You walk out of the air, my lord?
  Ham. Into my grave?
  Pol. Indeed, tha
t is out o' th' air. [Aside] How pregnant
sometimes
    his replies are! a happiness that often ma
dness hits on,
which
    reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of.
I
    will
 leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting
between
    him and my daughter.- My honoura
ble lord, I will most humbly
take
    my leave of you.
  Ham. You cannot, sir, take from me anyth
ing that I will more
    willingly part withal- except my life, except my life, except
my
    lif
e,

                    Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Pol. Fare you well, my lord.
  H
am. These tedious old fools!
  Pol. You go to seek the Lord Hamlet. There he is.
  Ros. [to Poloni
us] God save you, sir!
                                                Exit [Polonius].

  Guil. 
My honour'd lord!
  Ros. My most dear lord!
  Ham. My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guild
enstern?
Ah,
    Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
  Ros. As the indifferent children of th
e earth.
  Guil. Happy in that we are not over-happy.
    On Fortune's cap we are not the very but
ton.
  Ham. Nor the soles of her shoe?
  Ros. Neither, my lord.
  Ham. Then you live about her wa
ist, or in the middle of her
    favours?
  Guil. Faith, her privates we.
  Ham. In the secret pa
rts of Fortune? O! most true! she is a
    strumpet. What news ?
  Ros. None, my lord, but that th
e world's grown honest.
  Ham. Then is doomsday near! But your news is not true. Let me
    questi
on more in particular. What have you, my good friends,
    deserved at the hands of Fortune that sh
e sends you to prison
    hither?
  Guil. Prison, my lord?
  Ham. Denmark's a prison.
  Ros. The
n is the world one.
  Ham. A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and
    dungeons
, Denmark being one o' th' worst.
  Ros. We think not so, my lord.
  Ham. Why, then 'tis none to y
ou; for there is nothing either
good
    or bad but thinking makes it so. To me it is a prison.
 
 Ros. Why, then your ambition makes it one. 'Tis too narrow for
your
    mind.
  Ham. O God, I co
uld be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a
    king of infinite space, were it not that I have
 bad dreams.
  Guil. Which dreams indeed are ambition; for the very substance
of
    the ambitiou
s is merely the shadow of a dream.
  Ham. A dream itself is but a shadow.
  Ros. Truly, and I hold
 ambition of so airy and light a quality
that
    it is but a shadow's shadow.
  Ham. Then are ou
r beggars bodies, and our monarchs and
outstretch'd
    heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we to t
h' court? for, by
my
    fay, I cannot reason.
  Both. We'll wait upon you.
  Ham. No such matte
r! I will not sort you with the rest of my
    servants; for, to speak to you like an honest man, I
 am most
    dreadfully attended. But in the beaten way of friendship,
what
    make you at Elsin
ore?
  Ros. To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
  Ham. Beggar that I am, I am even poor in t
hanks; but I thank
you;
    and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny.
Were
   
 you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free
    visitation? Come, deal justly with me
. Come, come! Nay,
speak.
  Guil. What should we say, my lord?
  Ham. Why, anything- but to th' p
urpose. You were sent for; and
    there is a kind of confession in your looks, which your
modesti
es
    have not craft enough to colour. I know the good King and
Queen
    have sent for you.
  
Ros. To what end, my lord?
  Ham. That you must teach me. But let me conjure you by the
rights
  
  of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the
    obligation of our ever-preserved lo
ve, and by what more dear
a
    better proposer could charge you withal, be even and direct
with

    me, whether you were sent for or no.
  Ros. [aside to Guildenstern] What say you?
  Ham. [asi
de] Nay then, I have an eye of you.- If you love me,
hold
    not off.
  Guil. My lord, we were s
ent for.
  Ham. I will tell you why. So shall my anticipation prevent your
    discovery, and your
 secrecy to the King and Queen moult no
    feather. I have of late- but wherefore I know not- lost
 all
my
    mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes
so
    heavily with my d
isposition that this goodly frame, the
earth,
    seems to me a sterile promontory; this most exce
llent canopy,
the
    air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this
majestical
    roof 
fretted with golden fire- why, it appeareth no other
thing
    to me than a foul and pestilent con
gregation of vapours. What
a
    piece of work is a man! how noble in reason! how infinite in
   
 faculties! in form and moving how express and admirable! in
    action how like an angel! in appre
hension how like a god! the
    beauty of the world, the paragon of animals! And yet to me
what
 
   is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me- no, nor
woman
    neither, though by your sm
iling you seem to say so.
  Ros. My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.
  Ham. Why did y
ou laugh then, when I said 'Man delights not me'?
  Ros. To think, my lord, if you delight not in m
an, what lenten
    entertainment the players shall receive from you. We coted
them
    on the wa
y, and hither are they coming to offer you service.
  Ham. He that plays the king shall be welcome-
 his Majesty shall
    have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil
and
    targ
et; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humorous man
shall
    end his part in peace; the clown s
hall make those laugh whose
    lungs are tickle o' th' sere; and the lady shall say her mind
    
freely, or the blank verse shall halt for't. What players are
    they?
  Ros. Even those you were
 wont to take such delight in, the
    tragedians of the city.
  Ham. How chances it they travel? 
Their residence, both in
    reputation and profit, was better both ways.
  Ros. I think their inh
ibition comes by the means of the late
    innovation.
  Ham. Do they hold the same estimation the
y did when I was in
the
    city? Are they so follow'd?
  Ros. No indeed are they not.
  Ham. Ho
w comes it? Do they grow rusty?
  Ros. Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there
is
,
    sir, an eyrie of children, little eyases, that cry out on the
top
    of question and are m
ost tyrannically clapp'd for't. These
are now
    the fashion, and so berattle the common stages (
so they call
    them) that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goosequills and
    dare scarce com
e thither.
  Ham. What, are they children? Who maintains 'em? How are they
    escoted? Will they 
pursue the quality no longer than they can
    sing? Will they not say afterwards, if they should g
row
    themselves to common players (as it is most like, if their
means
    are no better), thei
r writers do them wrong to make them
exclaim
    against their own succession.
  Ros. Faith, ther
e has been much to do on both sides; and the
nation
    holds it no sin to tarre them to controver
sy. There was, for
a
    while, no money bid for argument unless the poet and the
player
    wen
t to cuffs in the question.
  Ham. Is't possible?
  Guil. O, there has been much throwing about of
 brains.
  Ham. Do the boys carry it away?
  Ros. Ay, that they do, my lord- Hercules and his load
 too.
  Ham. It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark,
and
    those that would ma
ke mows at him while my father lived give
    twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his
 picture
in
    little. 'Sblood, there is something in this more than
natural, if
    philosophy
 could find it out.

                     Flourish for the Players.

  Guil. There are the playe
rs.
  Ham. Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come!
Th'
    appurtenance of welc
ome is fashion and ceremony. Let me
comply
    with you in this garb, lest my extent to the player
s (which I
    tell you must show fairly outwards) should more appear like
    entertainment than 
yours. You are welcome. But my
uncle-father
    and aunt-mother are deceiv'd.
  Guil. In what, my
 dear lord?
  Ham. I am but mad north-north-west. When the wind is southerly
I
    know a hawk fr
om a handsaw.

                            Enter Polonius.

  Pol. Well be with you, gentlemen!

  Ham. Hark you, Guildenstern- and you too- at each ear a hearer!
    That great baby you see ther
e is not yet out of his swaddling
    clouts.
  Ros. Happily he's the second time come to them; fo
r they say an
old
    man is twice a child.
  Ham. I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the pla
yers. Mark
it.-
   You say right, sir; a Monday morning; twas so indeed.
  Pol. My lord, I have n
ews to tell you.
  Ham. My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an
actor in
    Rome-

  Pol. The actors are come hither, my lord.
  Ham. Buzz, buzz!
  Pol. Upon my honour-
  Ham. The
n came each actor on his ass-
  Pol. The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy,
   
 history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral,
    tragical-historical, tragical-comica
l-historical-pastoral;
scene
    individable, or poem unlimited. Seneca cannot be too heavy,
nor

    Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these
are
    the only men.
  Ham. O
 Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
  Pol. What treasure had he, my lord?
  Ha
m. Why,

         'One fair daughter, and no more,
           The which he loved passing well.'


  Pol. [aside] Still on my daughter.
  Ham. Am I not i' th' right, old Jephthah?
  Pol. If you c
all me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I
    love passing well.
  Ham. Nay, that follows
 not.
  Pol. What follows then, my lord?
  Ham. Why,

           'As by lot, God wot,'

 and t
hen, you know,

           'It came to pass, as most like it was.'

    The first row of the pio
us chanson will show you more; for
look
    where my abridgment comes.

                     Ent
er four or five Players.

    You are welcome, masters; welcome, all.- I am glad to see
thee
   
 well.- Welcome, good friends.- O, my old friend? Why, thy
face is
    valanc'd since I saw thee l
ast. Com'st' thou to' beard me in
    Denmark?- What, my young lady and mistress? By'r Lady, your

    ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last by the
    altitude of a chopine. Pray Go
d your voice, like a piece of
    uncurrent gold, be not crack'd within the ring.- Masters, you
ar
e
    all welcome. We'll e'en to't like French falconers, fly at
    anything we see. We'll have a
 speech straight. Come, give us
a
    taste of your quality. Come, a passionate speech.
  1. Play
. What speech, my good lord?
  Ham. I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never
acted;

    or if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember,
pleas'd
    not the million, 'twas cav
iary to the general; but it was (as
I
    receiv'd it, and others, whose judgments in such matters

cried in
    the top of mine) an excellent play, well digested in the
scenes,
    set down with
 as much modesty as cunning. I remember one said
    there were no sallets in the lines to make the
 matter
savoury,
    nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of
    affectation;
 but call'd it an honest method, as wholesome as
    sweet, and by very much more handsome than fin
e. One speech
in't
    I chiefly lov'd. 'Twas AEneas' tale to Dido, and thereabout
of it
    esp
ecially where he speaks of Priam's slaughter. If it live
in
    your memory, begin at this line- l
et me see, let me see:

         'The rugged Pyrrhus, like th' Hyrcanian beast-'

    'Tis not s
o; it begins with Pyrrhus:

         'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
         Black as 
his purpose, did the night resemble
         When he lay couched in the ominous horse,
         Ha
th now this dread and black complexion smear'd
         With heraldry more dismal. Head to foot
  
       Now is be total gules, horridly trick'd
         With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, 
sons,
         Bak'd and impasted with the parching streets,
         That lend a tyrannous and a 
damned light
         To their lord's murther. Roasted in wrath and fire,
         And thus o'ersi
zed with coagulate gore,
         With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
         Old gran
dsire Priam seeks.'

    So, proceed you.
  Pol. Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent
 and good
     discretion.

  1. Play. 'Anon he finds him,
      Striking too short at Greeks. H
is antique sword,
      Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
      Repugnant to command. Un
equal match'd,
      Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide;
      But with the whiff and w
ind of his fell sword
      Th' unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
      Seeming to feel
 this blow, with flaming top
      Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
      Takes prison
er Pyrrhus' ear. For lo! his sword,
      Which was declining on the milky head
      Of reverend 
Priam, seem'd i' th' air to stick.
      So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
      And, like a
 neutral to his will and matter,
      Did nothing.
      But, as we often see, against some storm
,
      A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
      The bold winds speechless, and the o
rb below
      As hush as death- anon the dreadful thunder
      Doth rend the region; so, after P
yrrhus' pause,
      Aroused vengeance sets him new awork;
      And never did the Cyclops' hammer
s fall
      On Mars's armour, forg'd for proof eterne,
      With less remorse than Pyrrhus' blee
ding sword
      Now falls on Priam.
      Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods,
      I
n general synod take away her power;
      Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
      
And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
      As low as to the fiends!

  Pol. This is t
oo long.
  Ham. It shall to the barber's, with your beard.- Prithee say
on.
    He's for a jig or
 a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps. Say on;
come to
    Hecuba.

  1. Play. 'But who, O who, had se
en the mobled queen-'

  Ham. 'The mobled queen'?
  Pol. That's good! 'Mobled queen' is good.


  1. Play. 'Run barefoot up and down, threat'ning the flames
      With bisson rheum; a clout upon 
that head
      Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
      About her lank and all o'erteem
ed loins,
      A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up-
      Who this had seen, with tongue in
 venom steep'd
      'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have pronounc'd.
      But if the gods 
themselves did see her then,
      When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
      In Mincing with
 his sword her husband's limbs,
      The instant burst of clamour that she made
      (Unless thi
ngs mortal move them not at all)
      Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven
      And 
passion in the gods.'

  Pol. Look, whe'r he has not turn'd his colour, and has tears
in's
    e
yes. Prithee no more!
  Ham. 'Tis well. I'll have thee speak out the rest of this
soon.-
    Good
 my lord, will you see the players well bestow'd? Do you
    hear? Let them be well us'd; for they 
are the abstract and
brief
    chronicles of the time. After your death you were better have
a
 
   bad epitaph than their ill report while you live.
  Pol. My lord, I will use them according to t
heir desert.
  Ham. God's bodykins, man, much better! Use every man after his
    desert, and who 
should scape whipping? Use them after your
own
    honour and dignity. The less they deserve, the 
more merit is
in
    your bounty. Take them in.
  Pol. Come, sirs.
  Ham. Follow him, friends. W
e'll hear a play to-morrow.
                 Exeunt Polonius and Players [except the First].
    D
ost thou hear me, old friend? Can you play 'The Murther of
    Gonzago'?
  1. Play. Ay, my lord.

  Ham. We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need, study a
    speech of some dozen or sixte
en lines which I would set down
and
    insert in't, could you not?
  1. Play. Ay, my lord.
  Ha
m. Very well. Follow that lord- and look you mock him not.
                                        
    [Exit First Player.]
    My good friends, I'll leave you till night. You are welcome
to
    E
lsinore.
  Ros. Good my lord!
  Ham. Ay, so, God b' wi' ye!
                            [Exeunt R
osencrantz and Guildenstern
    Now I am alone.
    O what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
    Is
 it not monstrous that this player here,
    But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
    Could fo
rce his soul so to his own conceit
    That, from her working, all his visage wann'd,
    Tears in
 his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
    A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
    With fo
rms to his conceit? And all for nothing!
    For Hecuba!
    What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba
,
    That he should weep for her? What would he do,
    Had he the motive and the cue for passion

    That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
    And cleave the general ear with horrid s
peech;
    Make mad the guilty and appal the free,
    Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed
  
  The very faculties of eyes and ears.
    Yet I,
    A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak
    L
ike John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
    And can say nothing! No, not for a king,
    Upon w
hose property and most dear life
    A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
    Who calls me vil
lain? breaks my pate across?
    Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?
    Tweaks me by th'
 nose? gives me the lie i' th' throat
    As deep as to the lungs? Who does me this, ha?
    'Swou
nds, I should take it! for it cannot be
    But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall
    To make oppr
ession bitter, or ere this
    I should have fatted all the region kites
    With this slave's off
al. Bloody bawdy villain!
    Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
    O, vengea
nce!
    Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
    That I, the son of a dear father murther'd
,
    Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
    Must (like a whore) unpack my heart with word
s
    And fall a-cursing like a very drab,
    A scullion!
    Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! 
Hum, I have heard
    That guilty creatures, sitting at a play,
    Have by the very cunning of th
e scene
    Been struck so to the soul that presently
    They have proclaim'd their malefactions;

    For murther, though it have no tongue, will speak
    With most miraculous organ, I'll have t
hese Players
    Play something like the murther of my father
    Before mine uncle. I'll observe 
his looks;
    I'll tent him to the quick. If he but blench,
    I know my course. The spirit that
 I have seen
    May be a devil; and the devil hath power
    T' assume a pleasing shape; yea, and
 perhaps
    Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
    As he is very potent with such spirits,
  
  Abuses me to damn me. I'll have grounds
    More relative than this. The play's the thing
    Wh
erein I'll catch the conscience of the King.         Exit.

ACT III. Scene I.
E
lsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern,

and Lords.

  King. And can you by no drift of circumstance
    Get from him why he puts on this 
confusion,
    Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
    With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?

  Ros. He does confess he feels himself distracted,
    But from what cause he will by no means spe
ak.
  Guil. Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
    But with a crafty madness keeps aloof
 
   When we would bring him on to some confession
    Of his true state.
  Queen. Did he receive yo
u well?
  Ros. Most like a gentleman.
  Guil. But with much forcing of his disposition.
  Ros. Ni
ggard of question, but of our demands
    Most free in his reply.
  Queen. Did you assay him
    
To any pastime?
  Ros. Madam, it so fell out that certain players
    We o'erraught on the way. Of
 these we told him,
    And there did seem in him a kind of joy
    To hear of it. They are here a
bout the court,
    And, as I think, they have already order
    This night to play before him.
 
 Pol. 'Tis most true;
    And he beseech'd me to entreat your Majesties
    To hear and see the ma
tter.
  King. With all my heart, and it doth much content me
    To hear him so inclin'd.
    Goo
d gentlemen, give him a further edge
    And drive his purpose on to these delights.
  Ros. We sha
ll, my lord.
                            Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
  King. Sweet Gertru
de, leave us too;
    For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
    That he, as 'twere by accide
nt, may here
    Affront Ophelia.
    Her father and myself (lawful espials)
    Will so bestow o
urselves that, seeing unseen,
    We may of their encounter frankly judge
    And gather by him, a
s he is behav'd,
    If't be th' affliction of his love, or no,
    That thus he suffers for.
  Q
ueen. I shall obey you;
    And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
    That your good beauties be t
he happy cause
    Of Hamlet's wildness. So shall I hope your virtues
    Will bring him to his wo
nted way again,
    To both your honours.
  Oph. Madam, I wish it may.
                          
                         [Exit Queen.]
  Pol. Ophelia, walk you here.- Gracious, so please you,
  
  We will bestow ourselves.- [To Ophelia] Read on this book,
    That show of such an exercise may 
colour
    Your loneliness.- We are oft to blame in this,
    'Tis too much prov'd, that with devo
tion's visage
    And pious action we do sugar o'er
    The Devil himself.
  King. [aside] O, 'ti
s too true!
    How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
    The harlot's cheek, beau
tied with plast'ring art,
    Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
    Than is my deed to m
y most painted word.
    O heavy burthen!
  Pol. I hear him coming. Let's withdraw, my lord.
    
                                  Exeunt King and Polonius].

                           Enter Ham
let.

  Ham. To be, or not to be- that is the question:
    Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to su
ffer
    The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
    Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
,
    And by opposing end them. To die- to sleep-
    No more; and by a sleep to say we end
    T
he heartache, and the thousand natural shocks
    That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation
    D
evoutly to be wish'd. To die- to sleep.
    To sleep- perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub!
   
 For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
    When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
 
   Must give us pause. There's the respect
    That makes calamity of so long life.
    For who wo
uld bear the whips and scorns of time,
    Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
    T
he pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay,
    The insolence of office, and the spurns
    That p
atient merit of th' unworthy takes,
    When he himself might his quietus make
    With a bare bod
kin? Who would these fardels bear,
    To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
    But that the dre
ad of something after death-
    The undiscover'd country, from whose bourn
    No traveller retur
ns- puzzles the will,
    And makes us rather bear those ills we have
    Than fly to others that 
we know not of?
    Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
    And thus the native hue of re
solution
    Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
    And enterprises of great pith and
 moment
    With this regard their currents turn awry
    And lose the name of action.- Soft you n
ow!
    The fair Ophelia!- Nymph, in thy orisons
    Be all my sins rememb'red.
  Oph. Good my lo
rd,
    How does your honour for this many a day?
  Ham. I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
  
Oph. My lord, I have remembrances of yours
    That I have longed long to re-deliver.
    I pray y
ou, now receive them.
  Ham. No, not I!
    I never gave you aught.
  Oph. My honour'd lord, you 
know right well you did,
    And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd
    As made the thing
s more rich. Their perfume lost,
    Take these again; for to the noble mind
    Rich gifts wax po
or when givers prove unkind.
    There, my lord.
  Ham. Ha, ha! Are you honest?
  Oph. My lord?

  Ham. Are you fair?
  Oph. What means your lordship?
  Ham. That if you be honest and fair, your 
honesty should admit
no
    discourse to your beauty.
  Oph. Could beauty, my lord, have better c
ommerce than with
honesty?
  Ham. Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform
    ho
nesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty
can
    translate beauty into his likene
ss. This was sometime a
paradox,
    but now the time gives it proof. I did love you once.
  Oph.
 Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
  Ham. You should not have believ'd me; for virtue cannot
 so
    inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it. I loved
you
    not.
  Oph. I was the
 more deceived.
  Ham. Get thee to a nunnery! Why wouldst thou be a breeder of
    sinners? I am m
yself indifferent honest, but yet I could
accuse
    me of such things that it were better my moth
er had not borne
me.
    I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more offences at
my
    be
ck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give
    them shape, or time to act them in.
 What should such fellows
as I
    do, crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves
al
l;
    believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where's your
    father?
  Oph. At home, my 
lord.
  Ham. Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool
    nowhere but in's own ho
use. Farewell.
  Oph. O, help him, you sweet heavens!
  Ham. If thou dost marry, I'll give thee th
is plague for thy
dowry:
    be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not
escape
  
  calumny. Get thee to a nunnery. Go, farewell. Or if thou wilt
    needs marry, marry a fool; for 
wise men know well enough what
    monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go; and quickly too.
 
   Farewell.
  Oph. O heavenly powers, restore him!
  Ham. I have heard of your paintings too, wel
l enough. God hath
    given you one face, and you make yourselves another. You jig,
you
    ambl
e, and you lisp; you nickname God's creatures and make
your
    wantonness your ignorance. Go to, 
I'll no more on't! it hath
made
    me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages. Those that are

    married already- all but one- shall live; the rest shall keep
as
    they are. To a nunnery, 
go.                            Exit.
  Oph. O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
    The court
ier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword,
    Th' expectancy and rose of the fair state,
  
  The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
    Th' observ'd of all observers- quite, quite down!

    And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
    That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
    
Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
    Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;

    That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
    Blasted with ecstasy. O, woe is me
    T' 
have seen what I have seen, see what I see!

                   Enter King and Polonius.

  King
. Love? his affections do not that way tend;
    Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,

    Was not like madness. There's something in his soul
    O'er which his melancholy sits on bro
od;
    And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
    Will be some danger; which for to prevent,

    I have in quick determination
    Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England
    For the
 demand of our neglected tribute.
    Haply the seas, and countries different,
    With variable o
bjects, shall expel
    This something-settled matter in his heart,
    Whereon his brains still b
eating puts him thus
    From fashion of himself. What think you on't?
  Pol. It shall do well. Bu
t yet do I believe
    The origin and commencement of his grief
    Sprung from neglected love.- H
ow now, Ophelia?
    You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said.
    We heard it all.- My lord, do
 as you please;
    But if you hold it fit, after the play
    Let his queen mother all alone entr
eat him
    To show his grief. Let her be round with him;
    And I'll be plac'd so please you, in
 the ear
    Of all their conference. If she find him not,
    To England send him; or confine him
 where
    Your wisdom best shall think.
  King. It shall be so.
    Madness in great ones must n
ot unwatch'd go.         Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. hall in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet a
nd three of the Players.

  Ham. Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounc'd it to you,
    tri
ppingly on the tongue. But if you mouth it, as many of our
    players do, I had as live the town c
rier spoke my lines. Nor
do
    not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all
    ge
ntly; for in the very torrent, tempest, and (as I may say)
    whirlwind of your passion, you must 
acquire and beget a
    temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to
the
    soul 
to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion
to
    tatters, to very rags, to split th
e cars of the groundlings,
who
    (for the most part) are capable of nothing but inexplicable
du
mb
    shows and noise. I would have such a fellow whipp'd for
o'erdoing
    Termagant. It out-he
rods Herod. Pray you avoid it.
  Player. I warrant your honour.
  Ham. Be not too tame neither; bu
t let your own discretion be
your
    tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the action;

with
    this special observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of
    nature: for anything s
o overdone is from the purpose of
playing,
    whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, t
o hold, as
    'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show Virtue her own
feature,
    scorn her own
 image, and the very age and body of the time
his
    form and pressure. Now this overdone, or com
e tardy off,
though
    it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious
    grieve; th
e censure of the which one must in your allowance
    o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there
 be players that
I
    have seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly (not
to
    spea
k it profanely), that, neither having the accent of
    Christians, nor the gait of Christian, paga
n, nor man, have
so
    strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of Nature's
    journeymen
 had made men, and not made them well, they
imitated
    humanity so abominably.
  Player. I hope
 we have reform'd that indifferently with us,
sir.
  Ham. O, reform it altogether! And let those t
hat play your
clowns
    speak no more than is set down for them. For there be of them
    that w
ill themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren
    spectators to laugh too, though in the 
mean time some
necessary
    question of the play be then to be considered. That's
villanous
   
 and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it.
Go
    make you ready.
             
                                    Exeunt Players.

            Enter Polonius, Rosencrantz, and 
Guildenstern.

    How now, my lord? Will the King hear this piece of work?
  Pol. And the Queen 
too, and that presently.
  Ham. Bid the players make haste, [Exit Polonius.] Will you two
    help
 to hasten them?
  Both. We will, my lord.                       Exeunt they two.
  Ham. What, ho,
 Horatio!

                      Enter Horatio.

  Hor. Here, sweet lord, at your service.
  Ha
m. Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
    As e'er my conversation cop'd withal.
  Hor. O, my dea
r lord!
  Ham. Nay, do not think I flatter;
    For what advancement may I hope from thee,
    Th
at no revenue hast but thy good spirits
    To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter
'd?
    No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
    And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee

    Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
    Since my dear soul was mistress of her c
hoice
    And could of men distinguish, her election
    Hath seal'd thee for herself. For thou ha
st been
    As one, in suff'ring all, that suffers nothing;
    A man that Fortune's buffets and r
ewards
    Hast ta'en with equal thanks; and blest are those
    Whose blood and judgment are so w
ell commingled
    That they are not a pipe for Fortune's finger
    To sound what stop she please
. Give me that man
    That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
    In my heart's core, ay
, in my heart of heart,
    As I do thee. Something too much of this I
    There is a play to-nigh
t before the King.
    One scene of it comes near the circumstance,
    Which I have told thee, of
 my father's death.
    I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
    Even with the very comment 
of thy soul
    Observe my uncle. If his occulted guilt
    Do not itself unkennel in one speech,

    It is a damned ghost that we have seen,
    And my imaginations are as foul
    As Vulcan's s
tithy. Give him heedful note;
    For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,
    And after we will bo
th our judgments join
    In censure of his seeming.
  Hor. Well, my lord.
    If he steal aught 
the whilst this play is playing,
    And scape detecting, I will pay the theft.

    Sound a flou
rish. [Enter Trumpets and Kettledrums. Danish
    march. [Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Ros
encrantz,
      Guildenstern, and other Lords attendant, with the Guard
                       car
rying torches.

  Ham. They are coming to the play. I must be idle.
    Get you a place.
  King.
 How fares our cousin Hamlet?
  Ham. Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish. I eat the
air,

    promise-cramm'd. You cannot feed capons so.
  King. I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet. T
hese words are
not
    mine.
  Ham. No, nor mine now. [To Polonius] My lord, you play'd once
   
 i' th' university, you say?
  Pol. That did I, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.
  Ham. Wh
at did you enact?
  Pol. I did enact Julius Caesar; I was kill'd i' th' Capitol;
Brutus
    kill'
d me.
  Ham. It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf
there. Be
    the players ready
.
  Ros. Ay, my lord. They stay upon your patience.
  Queen. Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by m
e.
  Ham. No, good mother. Here's metal more attractive.
  Pol. [to the King] O, ho! do you mark t
hat?
  Ham. Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
                                  [Sits down at Ophelia
's feet.]

  Oph. No, my lord.
  Ham. I mean, my head upon your lap?
  Oph. Ay, my lord.
  Ham.
 Do you think I meant country matters?
  Oph. I think nothing, my lord.
  Ham. That's a fair thoug
ht to lie between maids' legs.
  Oph. What is, my lord?
  Ham. Nothing.
  Oph. You are merry, my 
lord.
  Ham. Who, I?
  Oph. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. O God, your only jig-maker! What should a man do 
but be
merry?
    For look you how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father
died
    within 's 
two hours.
  Oph. Nay 'tis twice two months, my lord.
  Ham. So long? Nay then, let the devil wear
 black, for I'll have
a
    suit of sables. O heavens! die two months ago, and not
forgotten
   
 yet? Then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his
life
    half a year. But, by'r Lady,
 he must build churches then; or
else
    shall he suffer not thinking on, with the hobby-horse, w
hose

    epitaph is 'For O, for O, the hobby-horse is forgot!'

               Hautboys play. T
he dumb show enters.

    Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing
    him and
 he her. She kneels, and makes show of protestation
    unto him. He takes her up, and declines his
 head upon her
    neck. He lays him down upon a bank of flowers. She, seeing
    him asleep, leav
es him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his
    crown, kisses it, pours poison in the sleeper's e
ars, and
    leaves him. The Queen returns, finds the King dead, and makes
    passionate action. 
The Poisoner with some three or four
Mutes,
    comes in again, seem to condole with her. The dead
 body is
    carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with gifts; she
    seems harsh and unwill
ing awhile, but in the end accepts
    his love.
                                                 
        Exeunt.

  Oph. What means this, my lord?
  Ham. Marry, this is miching malhecho; it mean
s mischief.
  Oph. Belike this show imports the argument of the play.

                      Ente
r Prologue.

  Ham. We shall know by this fellow. The players cannot keep
counsel;
    they'll t
ell all.
  Oph. Will he tell us what this show meant?
  Ham. Ay, or any show that you'll show him.
 Be not you asham'd
to
    show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means.
  Oph. You are naught
, you are naught! I'll mark the play.

    Pro. For us, and for our tragedy,
      Here stooping 
to your clemency,
      We beg your hearing patiently.                     [Exit.]

  Ham. Is thi
s a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
  Oph. 'Tis brief, my lord.
  Ham. As woman's love.

      
        Enter [two Players as] King and Queen.

    King. Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gon
e round
      Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
      And thirty dozen moons with borr
owed sheen
      About the world have times twelve thirties been,
      Since love our hearts, and
 Hymen did our hands,
      Unite comutual in most sacred bands.
    Queen. So many journeys may t
he sun and moon
      Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
      But woe is me! you are so s
ick of late,
      So far from cheer and from your former state.
      That I distrust you. Yet, t
hough I distrust,
      Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must;
      For women's fear and love 
holds quantity,
      In neither aught, or in extremity.
      Now what my love is, proof hath mad
e you know;
      And as my love is siz'd, my fear is so.
      Where love is great, the littlest 
doubts are fear;
      Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.
    King. Faith, I m
ust leave thee, love, and shortly too;
      My operant powers their functions leave to do.
      
And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
      Honour'd, belov'd, and haply one as kind
    
  For husband shalt thou-
    Queen. O, confound the rest!
      Such love must needs be treason i
n my breast.
      When second husband let me be accurst!
      None wed the second but who killed
 the first.

  Ham. [aside] Wormwood, wormwood!

    Queen. The instances that second marriage m
ove
      Are base respects of thrift, but none of love.
      A second time I kill my husband dea
d
      When second husband kisses me in bed.
    King. I do believe you think what now you speak;

      But what we do determine oft we break.
      Purpose is but the slave to memory,
      Of 
violent birth, but poor validity;
      Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree,
      Bu
t fall unshaken when they mellow be.
      Most necessary 'tis that we forget
      To pay ourselv
es what to ourselves is debt.
      What to ourselves in passion we propose,
      The passion end
ing, doth the purpose lose.
      The violence of either grief or joy
      Their own enactures wi
th themselves destroy.
      Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
      Grief joys, joy 
grieves, on slender accident.
      This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
      That eve
n our loves should with our fortunes change;
      For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
     
 Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
      The great man down, you mark his favourite 
flies,
      The poor advanc'd makes friends of enemies;
      And hitherto doth love on fortune t
end,
      For who not needs shall never lack a friend,
      And who in want a hollow friend doth
 try,
      Directly seasons him his enemy.
      But, orderly to end where I begun,
      Our wi
lls and fates do so contrary run
      That our devices still are overthrown;
      Our thoughts a
re ours, their ends none of our own.
      So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
      But die
 thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
    Queen. Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light,

      Sport and repose lock from me day and night,
      To desperation turn my trust and hope,
 
     An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope,
      Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
    
  Meet what I would have well, and it destroy,
      Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,

      If, once a widow, ever I be wife!

  Ham. If she should break it now!

    King. 'Tis dee
ply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile.
      My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile
     
 The tedious day with sleep.
    Queen. Sleep rock thy brain,
                                    
                [He] sleeps.
      And never come mischance between us twain!
Exit.

  Ham. Mada
m, how like you this play?
  Queen. The lady doth protest too much, methinks.
  Ham. O, but she'll
 keep her word.
  King. Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in't?
  Ham. No, no! They
 do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i'
th'
    world.
  King. What do you call the play?
  
Ham. 'The Mousetrap.' Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the
    image of a murther done in Vienn
a. Gonzago is the duke's
name;
    his wife, Baptista. You shall see anon. 'Tis a knavish piece
o
f
    work; but what o' that? Your Majesty, and we that have free
    souls, it touches us not. Le
t the gall'd jade winch; our
withers
    are unwrung.

                         Enter Lucianus.


    This is one Lucianus, nephew to the King.
  Oph. You are as good as a chorus, my lord.
  Ha
m. I could interpret between you and your love, if I could
see
    the puppets dallying.
  Oph. Y
ou are keen, my lord, you are keen.
  Ham. It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
  Oph
. Still better, and worse.
  Ham. So you must take your husbands.- Begin, murtherer. Pox,
leave
 
   thy damnable faces, and begin! Come, the croaking raven doth
    bellow for revenge.

    Luc.
 Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
      Confederate season, else no creatur
e seeing;
      Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,
      With Hecate's ban thrice bla
sted, thrice infected,
      Thy natural magic and dire property
      On wholesome life usurp imm
ediately.
                                   Pours the poison in his ears.

  Ham. He poisons him
 i' th' garden for's estate. His name's
Gonzago.
    The story is extant, and written in very choi
ce Italian. You
    shall see anon how the murtherer gets the love of Gonzago's
wife.
  Oph. The 
King rises.
  Ham. What, frighted with false fire?
  Queen. How fares my lord?
  Pol. Give o'er t
he play.
  King. Give me some light! Away!
  All. Lights, lights, lights!
                       
       Exeunt all but Hamlet and Horatio.
  Ham.   Why, let the strucken deer go weep,
          T
he hart ungalled play;
         For some must watch, while some must sleep:
          Thus runs th
e world away.
    Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers- if the rest of
my
    fortunes t
urn Turk with me-with two Provincial roses on my
raz'd
    shoes, get me a fellowship in a cry of 
players, sir?
  Hor. Half a share.
  Ham.   A whole one I!
         For thou dost know, O Damon d
ear,
           This realm dismantled was
         Of Jove himself; and now reigns here
         
  A very, very- pajock.
  Hor. You might have rhym'd.
  Ham. O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's
 word for a thousand
    pound! Didst perceive?
  Hor. Very well, my lord.
  Ham. Upon the talk o
f the poisoning?
  Hor. I did very well note him.
  Ham.   Aha! Come, some music! Come, the record
ers!
         For if the King like not the comedy,
         Why then, belike he likes it not, perd
y.
    Come, some music!

                Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Guil. Good my 
lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.
  Ham. Sir, a whole history.
  Guil. The King, sir-
  Ham. Ay
, sir, what of him?
  Guil. Is in his retirement, marvellous distemper'd.
  Ham. With drink, sir?

  Guil. No, my lord; rather with choler.
  Ham. Your wisdom should show itself more richer to sign
ify this
to
    the doctor; for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps
    plunge him into 
far more choler.
  Guil. Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame, and
start
    not so w
ildly from my affair.
  Ham. I am tame, sir; pronounce.
  Guil. The Queen, your mother, in most gr
eat affliction of
spirit
    hath sent me to you.
  Ham. You are welcome.
  Guil. Nay, good my l
ord, this courtesy is not of the right
breed.
    If it shall please you to make me a wholesome an
swer, I will
do
    your mother's commandment; if not, your pardon and my return
    shall be the
 end of my business.
  Ham. Sir, I cannot.
  Guil. What, my lord?
  Ham. Make you a wholesome ans
wer; my wit's diseas'd. But, sir,
such
    answer as I can make, you shall command; or rather, as 
you
say,
    my mother. Therefore no more, but to the matter! My mother,
you
    say-
  Ros. Th
en thus she says: your behaviour hath struck her into
    amazement and admiration.
  Ham. O wonde
rful son, that can so stonish a mother! But is
there no
    sequel at the heels of this mother's a
dmiration? Impart.
  Ros. She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to
bed.
  Ham. W
e shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any
    further trade with us?
  Ros. My lor
d, you once did love me.
  Ham. And do still, by these pickers and stealers!
  Ros. Good my lord, 
what is your cause of distemper? You do
surely
    bar the door upon your own liberty, if you deny
 your griefs
to
    your friend.
  Ham. Sir, I lack advancement.
  Ros. How can that be, when yo
u have the voice of the King
himself
    for your succession in Denmark?
  Ham. Ay, sir, but 'whi
le the grass grows'- the proverb is
something
    musty.

                     Enter the Players
 with recorders.

    O, the recorders! Let me see one. To withdraw with you- why
do
    you go 
about to recover the wind of me, as if you would drive
me
    into a toil?
  Guil. O my lord, if 
my duty be too bold, my love is too
unmannerly.
  Ham. I do not well understand that. Will you pla
y upon this
pipe?
  Guil. My lord, I cannot.
  Ham. I pray you.
  Guil. Believe me, I cannot.
 
 Ham. I do beseech you.
  Guil. I know, no touch of it, my lord.
  Ham. It is as easy as lying. Go
vern these ventages with your
    fingers and thumbs, give it breath with your mouth, and it
will

    discourse most eloquent music. Look you, these are the stops.
  Guil. But these cannot I comma
nd to any utt'rance of harmony. I
    have not the skill.
  Ham. Why, look you now, how unworthy a
 thing you make of me!
You
    would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you
would
  
  pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound me from my
    lowest note to the top of my co
mpass; and there is much
music,
    excellent voice, in this little organ, yet cannot you make it

    speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am easier to be play'd on than
a
    pipe? Call me what instru
ment you will, though you can fret
me,
    you cannot play upon me.

                        Ent
er Polonius.

    God bless you, sir!
  Pol. My lord, the Queen would speak with you, and present
ly.
  Ham. Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
  Pol. By th' mass, and 'tis
 like a camel indeed.
  Ham. Methinks it is like a weasel.
  Pol. It is back'd like a weasel.
  H
am. Or like a whale.
  Pol. Very like a whale.
  Ham. Then will I come to my mother by-and-by.- Th
ey fool me to
the
    top of my bent.- I will come by-and-by.
  Pol. I will say so.              
                        Exit.
  Ham. 'By-and-by' is easily said.- Leave me, friends.
             
                           [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]

    'Tis now the very witching time of night,

    When churchyards yawn, and hell itself breathes out
    Contagion to this world. Now could I 
drink hot blood
    And do such bitter business as the day
    Would quake to look on. Soft! now t
o my mother!
    O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever
    The soul of Nero enter this firm b
osom.
    Let me be cruel, not unnatural;
    I will speak daggers to her, but use none.
    My t
ongue and soul in this be hypocrites-
    How in my words somever she be shent,
    To give them s
eals never, my soul, consent!             Exit.




Scene III.
A room in the Castle.

Enter 
King, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.

  King. I like him not, nor stands it safe with us
    To l
et his madness range. Therefore prepare you;
    I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
    An
d he to England shall along with you.
    The terms of our estate may not endure
    Hazard so nea
r us as doth hourly grow
    Out of his lunacies.
  Guil. We will ourselves provide.
    Most hol
y and religious fear it is
    To keep those many many bodies safe
    That live and feed upon you
r Majesty.
  Ros. The single and peculiar life is bound
    With all the strength and armour of th
e mind
    To keep itself from noyance; but much more
    That spirit upon whose weal depends and 
rests
    The lives of many. The cesse of majesty
    Dies not alone, but like a gulf doth draw
 
   What's near it with it. It is a massy wheel,
    Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,
    
To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
    Are mortis'd and adjoin'd; which when it falls,

    Each small annexment, petty consequence,
    Attends the boist'rous ruin. Never alone
    Di
d the king sigh, but with a general groan.
  King. Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;
   
 For we will fetters put upon this fear,
    Which now goes too free-footed.
  Both. We will haste
 us.
                                               Exeunt Gentlemen.

                   Enter P
olonius.

  Pol. My lord, he's going to his mother's closet.
    Behind the arras I'll convey mys
elf
    To hear the process. I'll warrant she'll tax him home;
    And, as you said, and wisely wa
s it said,
    'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,
    Since nature makes them partia
l, should o'erhear
    The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege.
    I'll call upon you ere
 you go to bed
    And tell you what I know.
  King. Thanks, dear my lord.
                      
                          Exit [Polonius].
    O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven;
    It 
hath the primal eldest curse upon't,
    A brother's murther! Pray can I not,
    Though inclinati
on be as sharp as will.
    My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent,
    And, like a man to dou
ble business bound,
    I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
    And both neglect. What if 
this cursed hand
    Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,
    Is there not rain enough i
n the sweet heavens
    To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
    But to confront the vis
age of offence?
    And what's in prayer but this twofold force,
    To be forestalled ere we come
 to fall,
    Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;
    My fault is past. But, O, what form o
f prayer
    Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murther'?
    That cannot be; since I am still
 possess'd
    Of those effects for which I did the murther-
    My crown, mine own ambition, and 
my queen.
    May one be pardon'd and retain th' offence?
    In the corrupted currents of this wo
rld
    Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,
    And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself

    Buys out the law; but 'tis not so above.
    There is no shuffling; there the action lies
   
 In his true nature, and we ourselves compell'd,
    Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,

    To give in evidence. What then? What rests?
    Try what repentance can. What can it not?
   
 Yet what can it when one cannot repent?
    O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
    O limed
 soul, that, struggling to be free,
    Art more engag'd! Help, angels! Make assay.
    Bow, stubb
orn knees; and heart with strings of steel,
    Be soft as sinews of the new-born babe!
    All ma
y be well.                                  He kneels.

                         Enter Hamlet.


  Ham. Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
    And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven,

    And so am I reveng'd. That would be scann'd.
    A villain kills my father; and for that,
    
I, his sole son, do this same villain send
    To heaven.
    Why, this is hire and salary, not re
venge!
    He took my father grossly, full of bread,
    With all his crimes broad blown, as flush
 as May;
    And how his audit stands, who knows save heaven?
    But in our circumstance and cour
se of thought,
    'Tis heavy with him; and am I then reveng'd,
    To take him in the purging of 
his soul,
    When he is fit and seasoned for his passage?
    No.
    Up, sword, and know thou a
 more horrid hent.
    When he is drunk asleep; or in his rage;
    Or in th' incestuous pleasure 
of his bed;
    At gaming, swearing, or about some act
    That has no relish of salvation in't-

    Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,
    And that his soul may be as damn'd and bl
ack
    As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays.
    This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.  
            Exit.
  King. [rises] My words fly up, my thoughts remain below.
    Words without tho
ughts never to heaven go.             Exit.




Scene IV.
The Queen's closet.

Enter Queen a
nd Polonius.

  Pol. He will come straight. Look you lay home to him.
    Tell him his pranks hav
e been too broad to bear with,
    And that your Grace hath screen'd and stood between
    Much he
at and him. I'll silence me even here.
    Pray you be round with him.
  Ham. (within) Mother, mot
her, mother!
  Queen. I'll warrant you; fear me not. Withdraw; I hear him
coming.
               
               [Polonius hides behind the arras.]

                          Enter Hamlet.

  Ha
m. Now, mother, what's the matter?
  Queen. Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
  Ham. Mot
her, you have my father much offended.
  Queen. Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
  Ham.
 Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
  Queen. Why, how now, Hamlet?
  Ham. What's the matte
r now?
  Queen. Have you forgot me?
  Ham. No, by the rood, not so!
    You are the Queen, your h
usband's brother's wife,
    And (would it were not so!) you are my mother.
  Queen. Nay, then I'l
l set those to you that can speak.
  Ham. Come, come, and sit you down. You shall not budge;
    Y
ou go not till I set you up a glass
    Where you may see the inmost part of you.
  Queen. What wi
lt thou do? Thou wilt not murther me?
    Help, help, ho!
  Pol. [behind] What, ho! help, help, he
lp!
  Ham. [draws] How now? a rat? Dead for a ducat, dead!
            [Makes a pass through the a
rras and] kills Polonius.
  Pol. [behind] O, I am slain!
  Queen. O me, what hast thou done?
  Ha
m. Nay, I know not. Is it the King?
  Queen. O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
  Ham. A bloo
dy deed- almost as bad, good mother,
    As kill a king, and marry with his brother.
  Queen. As k
ill a king?
  Ham. Ay, lady, it was my word.
                         [Lifts up the arras and sees
 Polonius.]
    Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
    I took thee for thy better. Tak
e thy fortune.
    Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.
    Leave wringing of your hands. P
eace! sit you down
    And let me wring your heart; for so I shall
    If it be made of penetrable
 stuff;
    If damned custom have not braz'd it so
    That it is proof and bulwark against sense.

  Queen. What have I done that thou dar'st wag thy tongue
    In noise so rude against me?
  Ham
. Such an act
    That blurs the grace and blush of modesty;
    Calls virtue hypocrite; takes off
 the rose
    From the fair forehead of an innocent love,
    And sets a blister there; makes marr
iage vows
    As false as dicers' oaths. O, such a deed
    As from the body of contraction plucks

    The very soul, and sweet religion makes
    A rhapsody of words! Heaven's face doth glow;
  
  Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
    With tristful visage, as against the doom,
    Is thou
ght-sick at the act.
  Queen. Ah me, what act,
    That roars so loud and thunders in the index?

  Ham. Look here upon th's picture, and on this,
    The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.

    See what a grace was seated on this brow;
    Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
   
 An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
    A station like the herald Mercury
    New lighted 
on a heaven-kissing hill:
    A combination and a form indeed
    Where every god did seem to set 
his seal
    To give the world assurance of a man.
    This was your husband. Look you now what fo
llows.
    Here is your husband, like a mildew'd ear
    Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you 
eyes?
    Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
    And batten on this moor? Ha! have you
 eyes
    You cannot call it love; for at your age
    The heyday in the blood is tame, it's humbl
e,
    And waits upon the judgment; and what judgment
    Would step from this to this? Sense sure
 you have,
    Else could you not have motion; but sure that sense
    Is apoplex'd; for madness w
ould not err,
    Nor sense to ecstacy was ne'er so thrall'd
    But it reserv'd some quantity of 
choice
    To serve in such a difference. What devil was't
    That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodm
an-blind?
    Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
    Ears without hands or eyes, smellin
g sans all,
    Or but a sickly part of one true sense
    Could not so mope.
    O shame! where 
is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
    If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
    To flaming youth 
let virtue be as wax
    And melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame
    When the compulsive ardou
r gives the charge,
    Since frost itself as actively doth burn,
    And reason panders will.
  
Queen. O Hamlet, speak no more!
    Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul,
    And there I see 
such black and grained spots
    As will not leave their tinct.
  Ham. Nay, but to live
    In th
e rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
    Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love
    Over the n
asty sty!
  Queen. O, speak to me no more!
    These words like daggers enter in mine ears.
    N
o more, sweet Hamlet!
  Ham. A murtherer and a villain!
    A slave that is not twentieth part the
 tithe
    Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
    A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
  
  That from a shelf the precious diadem stole
    And put it in his pocket!
  Queen. No more!

 
               Enter the Ghost in his nightgown.

  Ham. A king of shreds and patches!-
    Save 
me and hover o'er me with your wings,
    You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?
  
Queen. Alas, he's mad!
  Ham. Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
    That, laps'd in time an
d passion, lets go by
    Th' important acting of your dread command?
    O, say!
  Ghost. Do not
 forget. This visitation
    Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
    But look, amazement on
 thy mother sits.
    O, step between her and her fighting soul
    Conceit in weakest bodies stro
ngest works.
    Speak to her, Hamlet.
  Ham. How is it with you, lady?
  Queen. Alas, how is't w
ith you,
    That you do bend your eye on vacancy,
    And with th' encorporal air do hold discour
se?
    Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
    And, as the sleeping soldiers in th' alar
m,
    Your bedded hairs, like life in excrements,
    Start up and stand an end. O gentle son,
 
   Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
    Sprinkle cool patience! Whereon do you look?
  Ham
. On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!
    His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stone
s,
    Would make them capable.- Do not look upon me,
    Lest with this piteous action you conver
t
    My stern effects. Then what I have to do
    Will want true colour- tears perchance for bloo
d.
  Queen. To whom do you speak this?
  Ham. Do you see nothing there?
  Queen. Nothing at all; 
yet all that is I see.
  Ham. Nor did you nothing hear?
  Queen. No, nothing but ourselves.
  Ham
. Why, look you there! Look how it steals away!
    My father, in his habit as he liv'd!
    Look 
where he goes even now out at the portal!
                                                     Exit
 Ghost.
  Queen. This is the very coinage of your brain.
    This bodiless creation ecstasy
    I
s very cunning in.
  Ham. Ecstasy?
    My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time
    And makes
 as healthful music. It is not madness
    That I have utt'red. Bring me to the test,
    And I th
e matter will reword; which madness
    Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
    Lay not 
that flattering unction to your soul
    That not your trespass but my madness speaks.
    It will
 but skin and film the ulcerous place,
    Whiles rank corruption, mining all within,
    Infects 
unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
    Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
    And do not 
spread the compost on the weeds
    To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;
    For in the
 fatness of these pursy times
    Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg-
    Yea, curb and woo for
 leave to do him good.
  Queen. O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
  Ham. O, throw away 
the worser part of it,
    And live the purer with the other half,
    Good night- but go not to m
y uncle's bed.
    Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
    That monster, custom, who all sense do
th eat
    Of habits evil, is angel yet in this,
    That to the use of actions fair and good
   
 He likewise gives a frock or livery,
    That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,
    And that sha
ll lend a kind of easiness
    To the next abstinence; the next more easy;
    For use almost can 
change the stamp of nature,
    And either [master] the devil, or throw him out
    With wondrous 
potency. Once more, good night;
    And when you are desirous to be blest,
    I'll blessing beg o
f you.- For this same lord,
    I do repent; but heaven hath pleas'd it so,
    To punish me with 
this, and this with me,
    That I must be their scourge and minister.
    I will bestow him, and 
will answer well
    The death I gave him. So again, good night.
    I must be cruel, only to be k
ind;
    Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.
    One word more, good lady.
  Queen. What s
hall I do?
  Ham. Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
    Let the bloat King tempt you again
 to bed;
    Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
    And let him, for a pair of reechy
 kisses,
    Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,
    Make you to ravel all this matt
er out,
    That I essentially am not in madness,
    But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him kn
ow;
    For who that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
    Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib

    Such dear concernings hide? Who would do so?
    No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
    Un
peg the basket on the house's top,
    Let the birds fly, and like the famous ape,
    To try conc
lusions, in the basket creep
    And break your own neck down.
  Queen. Be thou assur'd, if words 
be made of breath,
    And breath of life, I have no life to breathe
    What thou hast said to me
.
  Ham. I must to England; you know that?
  Queen. Alack,
    I had forgot! 'Tis so concluded on
.
  Ham. There's letters seal'd; and my two schoolfellows,
    Whom I will trust as I will adders 
fang'd,
    They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way
    And marshal me to knavery. Let it wo
rk;
    For 'tis the sport to have the enginer
    Hoist with his own petar; and 't shall go hard

    But I will delve one yard below their mines
    And blow them at the moon. O, 'tis most sweet

    When in one line two crafts directly meet.
    This man shall set me packing.
    I'll lug th
e guts into the neighbour room.-
    Mother, good night.- Indeed, this counsellor
    Is now most 
still, most secret, and most grave,
    Who was in life a foolish peating knave.
    Come, sir, to
 draw toward an end with you.
    Good night, mother.
                  [Exit the Queen. Then] Exi
t Hamlet, tugging in
                                                       Polonius.

ACT IV. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King and Queen, with Rosencrantz 
and Guildenstern.

  King. There's matter in these sighs. These profound heaves
    You must tran
slate; 'tis fit we understand them.
    Where is your son?
  Queen. Bestow this place on us a litt
le while.
                          [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
    Ah, mine own lord, 
what have I seen to-night!
  King. What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
  Queen. Mad as the sea and wi
nd when both contend
    Which is the mightier. In his lawless fit
    Behind the arras hearing so
mething stir,
    Whips out his rapier, cries 'A rat, a rat!'
    And in this brainish apprehensio
n kills
    The unseen good old man.
  King. O heavy deed!
    It had been so with us, had we bee
n there.
    His liberty is full of threats to all-
    To you yourself, to us, to every one.
   
 Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
    It will be laid to us, whose providence
    Sho
uld have kept short, restrain'd, and out of haunt
    This mad young man. But so much was our love

    We would not understand what was most fit,
    But, like the owner of a foul disease,
    To 
keep it from divulging, let it feed
    Even on the pith of life. Where is he gone?
  Queen. To dr
aw apart the body he hath kill'd;
    O'er whom his very madness, like some ore
    Among a minera
l of metals base,
    Shows itself pure. He weeps for what is done.
  King. O Gertrude, come away!

    The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch
    But we will ship him hence; and this vile dee
d
    We must with all our majesty and skill
    Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!


             Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

    Friends both, go join you with some further
 aid.
    Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
    And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd 
him.
    Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body
    Into the chapel. I pray you haste in 
this.
                          Exeunt [Rosencrantz and Guildenstern].
    Come, Gertrude, we'll c
all up our wisest friends
    And let them know both what we mean to do
    And what's untimely do
ne. [So haply slander-]
    Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter,
    As level as the cannon to
 his blank,
    Transports his poisoned shot- may miss our name
    And hit the woundless air.- O,
 come away!
    My soul is full of discord and dismay.
                                           
              Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A passage in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet.

  H
am. Safely stow'd.
  Gentlemen. (within) Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!
  Ham. But soft! What noise? Who cal
ls on Hamlet? O, here they
come.

               Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Ros. Wh
at have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
  Ham. Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
 
 Ros. Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
    And bear it to the chapel.
  Ham. Do not 
believe it.
  Ros. Believe what?
  Ham. That I can keep your counsel, and not mine own. Besides,

to be
    demanded of a sponge, what replication should be made by the
son
    of a king?
  Ros.
 Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
  Ham. Ay, sir; that soaks up the King's countenance, his
rewa
rds,
    his authorities. But such officers do the King best service
in
    the end. He keeps the
m, like an ape, in the corner of his
jaw;
    first mouth'd, to be last swallowed. When he needs w
hat you
have
    glean'd, it is but squeezing you and, sponge, you shall be
dry
    again.
  Ro
s. I understand you not, my lord.
  Ham. I am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.

  Ros. My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us
to
    the King.
  Ham. The b
ody is with the King, but the King is not with the
body.
    The King is a thing-
  Guil. A thing
, my lord?
  Ham. Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.
                          
                               Exeunt.




Scene III.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter
 King.

  King. I have sent to seek him and to find the body.
    How dangerous is it that this m
an goes loose!
    Yet must not we put the strong law on him.
    He's lov'd of the distracted mul
titude,
    Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;
    And where 'tis so, th' offender's 
scourge is weigh'd,
    But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,
    This sudden sendin
g him away must seem
    Deliberate pause. Diseases desperate grown
    By desperate appliance are
 reliev'd,
    Or not at all.

                    Enter Rosencrantz.

    How now O What hath 
befall'n?
  Ros. Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
    We cannot get from him.
  King. Bu
t where is he?
  Ros. Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
  King. Bring him before u
s.
  Ros. Ho, Guildenstern! Bring in my lord.

        Enter Hamlet and Guildenstern [with Attend
ants].

  King. Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
  Ham. At supper.
  King. At supper? Where?
  Ha
m. Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A certain
    convocation of politic worms are e'en at
 him. Your worm is
your
    only emperor for diet. We fat all creatures else to fat us,
and
    
we fat ourselves for maggots. Your fat king and your lean
beggar
    is but variable service- two 
dishes, but to one table. That's
the
    end.
  King. Alas, alas!
  Ham. A man may fish with the
 worm that hath eat of a king, and
eat
    of the fish that hath fed of that worm.
  King. What d
ost thou mean by this?
  Ham. Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress
through
    th
e guts of a beggar.
  King. Where is Polonius?
  Ham. In heaven. Send thither to see. If your mess
enger find him
not
    there, seek him i' th' other place yourself. But indeed, if
you
    find 
him not within this month, you shall nose him as you go
up
    the stair, into the lobby.
  King.
 Go seek him there. [To Attendants.]
  Ham. He will stay till you come.
                          
                  [Exeunt Attendants.]
  King. Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,-
    
Which we do tender as we dearly grieve
    For that which thou hast done,- must send thee hence
  
  With fiery quickness. Therefore prepare thyself.
    The bark is ready and the wind at help,
   
 Th' associates tend, and everything is bent
    For England.
  Ham. For England?
  King. Ay, Ham
let.
  Ham. Good.
  King. So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
  Ham. I see a cherub that sees
 them. But come, for England!
    Farewell, dear mother.
  King. Thy loving father, Hamlet.
  Ham
. My mother! Father and mother is man and wife; man and wife
is
    one flesh; and so, my mother. 
Come, for England!
Exit.
  King. Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard.
    Delay it no
t; I'll have him hence to-night.
    Away! for everything is seal'd and done
    That else leans o
n th' affair. Pray you make haste.
                            Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]

    And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught,-
    As my great power thereof may give thee 
sense,
    Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
    After the Danish sword, and thy free awe

    Pays homage to us,- thou mayst not coldly set
    Our sovereign process, which imports at full
,
    By letters congruing to that effect,
    The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;
    F
or like the hectic in my blood he rages,
    And thou must cure me. Till I know 'tis done,
    How
e'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.             Exit.

Scene IV.
Near Elsin
ore.

Enter Fortinbras with his Army over the stage.

  For. Go, Captain, from me greet the Dani
sh king.
    Tell him that by his license Fortinbras
    Craves the conveyance of a promis'd march

    Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.
    If that his Majesty would aught with us,
    
We shall express our duty in his eye;
    And let him know so.
  Capt. I will do't, my lord.
  Fo
r. Go softly on.
                                   Exeunt [all but the Captain].

       Enter H
amlet, Rosencrantz, [Guildenstern,] and others.

  Ham. Good sir, whose powers are these?
  Capt.
 They are of Norway, sir.
  Ham. How purpos'd, sir, I pray you?
  Capt. Against some part of Polan
d.
  Ham. Who commands them, sir?
  Capt. The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.
  Ham. Goes it ag
ainst the main of Poland, sir,
    Or for some frontier?
  Capt. Truly to speak, and with no addit
ion,
    We go to gain a little patch of ground
    That hath in it no profit but the name.
    T
o pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
    Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
    A ra
nker rate, should it be sold in fee.
  Ham. Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
  Capt. Yes
, it is already garrison'd.
  Ham. Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
    Will not deba
te the question of this straw.
    This is th' imposthume of much wealth and peace,
    That inwar
d breaks, and shows no cause without
    Why the man dies.- I humbly thank you, sir.
  Capt. God b
' wi' you, sir.                             [Exit.]
  Ros. Will't please you go, my lord?
  Ham. I
'll be with you straight. Go a little before.
                                        [Exeunt all b
ut Hamlet.]
    How all occasions do inform against me
    And spur my dull revenge! What is a man
,
    If his chief good and market of his time
    Be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.
  
  Sure he that made us with such large discourse,
    Looking before and after, gave us not
    Th
at capability and godlike reason
    To fust in us unus'd. Now, whether it be
    Bestial oblivion
, or some craven scruple
    Of thinking too precisely on th' event,-
    A thought which, quarter
'd, hath but one part wisdom
    And ever three parts coward,- I do not know
    Why yet I live to
 say 'This thing's to do,'
    Sith I have cause, and will, and strength, and means
    To do't. E
xamples gross as earth exhort me.
    Witness this army of such mass and charge,
    Led by a deli
cate and tender prince,
    Whose spirit, with divine ambition puff'd,
    Makes mouths at the inv
isible event,
    Exposing what is mortal and unsure
    To all that fortune, death, and danger da
re,
    Even for an eggshell. Rightly to be great
    Is not to stir without great argument,
    
But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
    When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,
    That 
have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,
    Excitements of my reason and my blood,
    And let all
 sleep, while to my shame I see
    The imminent death of twenty thousand men
    That for a fanta
sy and trick of fame
    Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot
    Whereon the numbers ca
nnot try the cause,
    Which is not tomb enough and continent
    To hide the slain? O, from this
 time forth,
    My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!            Exit.

Scene V.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter Horatio, Queen, and a Gentleman.

  Queen. I wi
ll not speak with her.
  Gent. She is importunate, indeed distract.
    Her mood will needs be pit
ied.
  Queen. What would she have?
  Gent. She speaks much of her father; says she hears
    Ther
e's tricks i' th' world, and hems, and beats her heart;
    Spurns enviously at straws; speaks thin
gs in doubt,
    That carry but half sense. Her speech is nothing,
    Yet the unshaped use of it 
doth move
    The hearers to collection; they aim at it,
    And botch the words up fit to their o
wn thoughts;
    Which, as her winks and nods and gestures yield them,
    Indeed would make one t
hink there might be thought,
    Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
  Hor. 'Twere good she w
ere spoken with; for she may strew
    Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.
  Queen. Let h
er come in.
                                               [Exit Gentleman.]
    [Aside] To my sic
k soul (as sin's true nature is)
    Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
    So full of a
rtless jealousy is guilt
    It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.

                 Enter Oph
elia distracted.

  Oph. Where is the beauteous Majesty of Denmark?
  Queen. How now, Ophelia?
 
 Oph. (sings)
         How should I your true-love know
           From another one?
         By 
his cockle bat and' staff
           And his sandal shoon.

  Queen. Alas, sweet lady, what impor
ts this song?
  Oph. Say you? Nay, pray You mark.

    (Sings) He is dead and gone, lady,
      
        He is dead and gone;
            At his head a grass-green turf,
              At his heel
s a stone.

    O, ho!
  Queen. Nay, but Ophelia-
  Oph. Pray you mark.

    (Sings) White his
 shroud as the mountain snow-

                    Enter King.

  Queen. Alas, look here, my lor
d!
  Oph. (Sings)
           Larded all with sweet flowers;
         Which bewept to the grave di
d not go
           With true-love showers.

  King. How do you, pretty lady?
  Oph. Well, God d
ild you! They say the owl was a baker's
daughter.
    Lord, we know what we are, but know not what
 we may be. God
be at
    your table!
  King. Conceit upon her father.
  Oph. Pray let's have no
 words of this; but when they ask, you
what
    it means, say you this:

    (Sings) To-morrow i
s Saint Valentine's day,
              All in the morning bedtime,
            And I a maid at you
r window,
              To be your Valentine.

            Then up he rose and donn'd his clo'es

              And dupp'd the chamber door,
            Let in the maid, that out a maid
         
     Never departed more.

  King. Pretty Ophelia!
  Oph. Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make 
an end on't!

    [Sings] By Gis and by Saint Charity,
              Alack, and fie for shame!
 
           Young men will do't if they come to't
              By Cock, they are to blame.

     
       Quoth she, 'Before you tumbled me,
              You promis'd me to wed.'

    He answers:


            'So would I 'a' done, by yonder sun,
              An thou hadst not come to my bed
.'

  King. How long hath she been thus?
  Oph. I hope all will be well. We must be patient; but 
I cannot
    choose but weep to think they would lay him i' th' cold
ground.
    My brother shall
 know of it; and so I thank you for your good
    counsel. Come, my coach! Good night, ladies. Good
 night,
sweet
    ladies. Good night, good night.                         Exit
  King. Follow her
 close; give her good watch, I pray you.
                                                 [Exit Hor
atio.]

    O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs
    All from her father's death. O Ge
rtrude, Gertrude,
    When sorrows come, they come not single spies.
    But in battalions! First,
 her father slain;
    Next, your son gone, and he most violent author
    Of his own just remove;
 the people muddied,
    Thick and and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers
    For good Pol
onius' death, and we have done but greenly
    In hugger-mugger to inter him; poor Ophelia
    Div
ided from herself and her fair judgment,
    Without the which we are pictures or mere beasts;
   
 Last, and as much containing as all these,
    Her brother is in secret come from France;
    And
 wants not buzzers to infect his ear
    Feeds on his wonder, keep, himself in clouds,
    With pe
stilent speeches of his father's death,
    Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
    Will nothin
g stick our person to arraign
    In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
    Like to a murd'rin
g piece, in many places
    Give me superfluous death.                  A noise within.
  Queen. A
lack, what noise is this?
  King. Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.

              
       Enter a Messenger.

    What is the matter?
  Mess. Save Yourself, my lord:
    The ocean
, overpeering of his list,
    Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
    Than Young Laertes
, in a riotous head,
    O'erbears Your offices. The rabble call him lord;
    And, as the world w
ere now but to begin,
    Antiquity forgot, custom not known,
    The ratifiers and props of every
 word,
    They cry 'Choose we! Laertes shall be king!'
    Caps, hands, and tongues applaud it to
 the clouds,
    'Laertes shall be king! Laertes king!'
                                          
       A noise within.
  Queen. How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!
    O, this is counter
, you false Danish dogs!
  King. The doors are broke.

                    Enter Laertes with oth
ers.

  Laer. Where is this king?- Sirs, staid you all without.
  All. No, let's come in!
  Laer
. I pray you give me leave.
  All. We will, we will!
  Laer. I thank you. Keep the door.      [Exe
unt his Followers.]
    O thou vile king,
    Give me my father!
  Queen. Calmly, good Laertes.

  Laer. That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard;
    Cries cuckold to my father; brands
 the harlot
    Even here between the chaste unsmirched brows
    Of my true mother.
  King. What
 is the cause, Laertes,
    That thy rebellion looks so giantlike?
    Let him go, Gertrude. Do no
t fear our person.
    There's such divinity doth hedge a king
    That treason can but peep to wh
at it would,
    Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,
    Why thou art thus incens'd. Let hi
m go, Gertrude.
    Speak, man.
  Laer. Where is my father?
  King. Dead.
  Queen. But not by hi
m!
  King. Let him demand his fill.
  Laer. How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
    To he
ll, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil
    Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
    
I dare damnation. To this point I stand,
    That both the world, I give to negligence,
    Let co
me what comes; only I'll be reveng'd
    Most throughly for my father.
  King. Who shall stay you?

  Laer. My will, not all the world!
    And for my means, I'll husband them so well
    They sha
ll go far with little.
  King. Good Laertes,
    If you desire to know the certainty
    Of your 
dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge
    That sweepstake you will draw both friend and fo
e,
    Winner and loser?
  Laer. None but his enemies.
  King. Will you know them then?
  Laer. 
To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms
    And, like the kind life-rend'ring pelican,
    
Repast them with my blood.
  King. Why, now You speak
    Like a good child and a true gentleman.

    That I am guiltless of your father's death,
    And am most sensibly in grief for it,
    It 
shall as level to your judgment pierce
    As day does to your eye.
                              
A noise within: 'Let her come in.'
  Laer. How now? What noise is that?

                      En
ter Ophelia.

    O heat, dry up my brains! Tears seven times salt
    Burn out the sense and vir
tue of mine eye!
    By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight
    Till our scale turn the be
am. O rose of May!
    Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
    O heavens! is't possible a young
 maid's wits
    Should be as mortal as an old man's life?
    Nature is fine in love, and where '
tis fine,
    It sends some precious instance of itself
    After the thing it loves.

  Oph. (s
ings)
         They bore him barefac'd on the bier
           (Hey non nony, nony, hey nony)
    
     And in his grave rain'd many a tear.

    Fare you well, my dove!
  Laer. Hadst thou thy wit
s, and didst persuade revenge,
    It could not move thus.
  Oph. You must sing 'A-down a-down, an
d you call him a-down-a.'
O,
    how the wheel becomes it! It is the false steward, that stole
hi
s
    master's daughter.
  Laer. This nothing's more than matter.
  Oph. There's rosemary, that's
 for remembrance. Pray you, love,
    remember. And there is pansies, that's for thoughts.
  Laer.
 A document in madness! Thoughts and remembrance fitted.
  Oph. There's fennel for you, and columbi
nes. There's rue for
you,
    and here's some for me. We may call it herb of grace o'
Sundays.
 
   O, you must wear your rue with a difference! There's a daisy.
I
    would give you some violets
, but they wither'd all when my
father
    died. They say he made a good end.

    [Sings] For b
onny sweet Robin is all my joy.

  Laer. Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,
    She tu
rns to favour and to prettiness.
  Oph. (sings)
         And will he not come again?
         And
 will he not come again?
           No, no, he is dead;
           Go to thy deathbed;
         H
e never will come again.

         His beard was as white as snow,
         All flaxen was his po
ll.
           He is gone, he is gone,
           And we cast away moan.
         God 'a'mercy on
 his soul!

    And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God b' wi' you.
Exit.
  Laer. Do you see
 this, O God?
  King. Laertes, I must commune with your grief,
    Or you deny me right. Go but ap
art,
    Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will,
    And they shall hear and judge 'twix
t you and me.
    If by direct or by collateral hand
    They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom
 give,
    Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours,
    To you in satisfaction; but if not,

    Be you content to lend your patience to us,
    And we shall jointly labour with your soul
 
   To give it due content.
  Laer. Let this be so.
    His means of death, his obscure funeral-
 
   No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,
    No noble rite nor formal ostentation,-
    
Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
    That I must call't in question.
  King. So yo
u shall;
    And where th' offence is let the great axe fall.
    I pray you go with me.
        
                                                  Exeunt

Scene VI.
Elsinore. A
nother room in the Castle.

Enter Horatio with an Attendant.

  Hor. What are they that would sp
eak with me?
  Servant. Seafaring men, sir. They say they have letters for
you.
  Hor. Let them c
ome in.
                                               [Exit Attendant.]
    I do not know from wh
at part of the world
    I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.

                         
 Enter Sailors.

  Sailor. God bless you, sir.
  Hor. Let him bless thee too.
  Sailor. 'A shall
, sir, an't please him. There's a letter for
you,
    sir,- it comes from th' ambassador that was 
bound for
England- if
    your name be Horatio, as I am let to know it is.
  Hor. (reads the lett
er) 'Horatio, when thou shalt have
overlook'd
    this, give these fellows some means to the King.
 They have
    letters for him. Ere we were two days old at sea, a pirate of

    very warlike ap
pointment gave us chase. Finding ourselves too
    slow of sail, we put on a compelled valour, and 
in the
grapple I
    boarded them. On the instant they got clear of our ship; so I
    alone beca
me their prisoner. They have dealt with me like
thieves
    of mercy; but they knew what they did:
 I am to do a good turn
for
    them. Let the King have the letters I have sent, and repair
thou

    to me with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death. I have
words
    to speak in thine ear wi
ll make thee dumb; yet are they much
too
    light for the bore of the matter. These good fellows 
will
bring
    thee where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their
course
    for England. 
Of them I have much to tell thee. Farewell.
                            'He that thou knowest thine
, HAMLET.'

    Come, I will give you way for these your letters,
    And do't the speedier that 
you may direct me
    To him from whom you brought them.                   Exeunt.

Scene VII.
Elsinore. Another room in the Castle.

Enter King and Laertes.

  King. Now mus
t your conscience my acquittance seal,
    And You must put me in your heart for friend,
    Sith 
you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
    That he which hath your noble father slain
    Pursued
 my life.
  Laer. It well appears. But tell me
    Why you proceeded not against these feats
    
So crimeful and so capital in nature,
    As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
    You main
ly were stirr'd up.
  King. O, for two special reasons,
    Which may to you, perhaps, seem much u
nsinew'd,
    But yet to me they are strong. The Queen his mother
    Lives almost by his looks; a
nd for myself,-
    My virtue or my plague, be it either which,-
    She's so conjunctive to my li
fe and soul
    That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
    I could not but by her. The oth
er motive
    Why to a public count I might not go
    Is the great love the general gender bear h
im,
    Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
    Would, like the spring that turneth wo
od to stone,
    Convert his gives to graces; so that my arrows,
    Too slightly timber'd for so 
loud a wind,
    Would have reverted to my bow again,
    And not where I had aim'd them.
  Laer.
 And so have I a noble father lost;
    A sister driven into desp'rate terms,
    Whose worth, if 
praises may go back again,
    Stood challenger on mount of all the age
    For her perfections. B
ut my revenge will come.
  King. Break not your sleeps for that. You must not think
    That we ar
e made of stuff so flat and dull
    That we can let our beard be shook with danger,
    And think
 it pastime. You shortly shall hear more.
    I lov'd your father, and we love ourself,
    And th
at, I hope, will teach you to imagine-

                 Enter a Messenger with letters.

    Ho
w now? What news?
  Mess. Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:
    This to your Majesty; this to the Que
en.
  King. From Hamlet? Who brought them?
  Mess. Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not.
  
  They were given me by Claudio; he receiv'd them
    Of him that brought them.
  King. Laertes, y
ou shall hear them.
    Leave us.
                                                 Exit Messenger.

    [Reads]'High and Mighty,-You shall know I am set naked on
your
    kingdom. To-morrow shall 
I beg leave to see your kingly eyes;
    when I shall (first asking your pardon thereunto) recount 
the
    occasion of my sudden and more strange return.
                                           
          'HAMLET.'
    What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?
    Or is it some abuse
, and no such thing?
  Laer. Know you the hand?
  King. 'Tis Hamlet's character. 'Naked!'
    And
 in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'
    Can you advise me?
  Laer. I am lost in it, my lord. B
ut let him come!
    It warms the very sickness in my heart
    That I shall live and tell him to 
his teeth,
    'Thus didest thou.'
  King. If it be so, Laertes
    (As how should it be so? how 
otherwise?),
    Will you be rul'd by me?
  Laer. Ay my lord,
    So you will not o'errule me to 
a peace.
  King. To thine own peace. If he be now return'd
    As checking at his voyage, and that
 he means
    No more to undertake it, I will work him
    To exploit now ripe in my device,
    
Under the which he shall not choose but fall;
    And for his death no wind shall breathe
    But 
even his mother shall uncharge the practice
    And call it accident.
  Laer. My lord, I will be r
ul'd;
    The rather, if you could devise it so
    That I might be the organ.
  King. It falls r
ight.
    You have been talk'd of since your travel much,
    And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a 
quality
    Wherein they say you shine, Your sum of parts
    Did not together pluck such envy fro
m him
    As did that one; and that, in my regard,
    Of the unworthiest siege.
  Laer. What par
t is that, my lord?
  King. A very riband in the cap of youth-
    Yet needfull too; for youth no 
less becomes
    The light and careless livery that it wears
    Than settled age his sables and h
is weeds,
    Importing health and graveness. Two months since
    Here was a gentleman of Normand
y.
    I have seen myself, and serv'd against, the French,
    And they can well on horseback; but
 this gallant
    Had witchcraft in't. He grew unto his seat,
    And to such wondrous doing broug
ht his horse
    As had he been incorps'd and demi-natur'd
    With the brave beast. So far he top
p'd my thought
    That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
    Come short of what he did.
  Laer
. A Norman was't?
  King. A Norman.
  Laer. Upon my life, Lamound.
  King. The very same.
  Laer
. I know him well. He is the broach indeed
    And gem of all the nation.
  King. He made confessi
on of you;
    And gave you such a masterly report
    For art and exercise in your defence,
    
And for your rapier most especially,
    That he cried out 'twould be a sight indeed
    If one co
uld match you. The scrimers of their nation
    He swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
    I
f you oppos'd them. Sir, this report of his
    Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
    That he co
uld nothing do but wish and beg
    Your sudden coming o'er to play with you.
    Now, out of this
-
  Laer. What out of this, my lord?
  King. Laertes, was your father dear to you?
    Or are you
 like the painting of a sorrow,
    A face without a heart,'
  Laer. Why ask you this?
  King. No
t that I think you did not love your father;
    But that I know love is begun by time,
    And th
at I see, in passages of proof,
    Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
    There lives withi
n the very flame of love
    A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
    And nothing is at a l
ike goodness still;
    For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
    Dies in his own too-much. That we 
would do,
    We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes,
    And hath abatements and de
lays as many
    As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
    And then this 'should' is lik
e a spendthrift sigh,
    That hurts by easing. But to the quick o' th' ulcer!
    Hamlet comes ba
ck. What would you undertake
    To show yourself your father's son in deed
    More than in words
?
  Laer. To cut his throat i' th' church!
  King. No place indeed should murther sanctuarize;
  
  Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,
    Will you do this? Keep close within your ch
amber.
    Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home.
    We'll put on those shall praise your 
excellence
    And set a double varnish on the fame
    The Frenchman gave you; bring you in fine 
together
    And wager on your heads. He, being remiss,
    Most generous, and free from all contr
iving,
    Will not peruse the foils; so that with ease,
    Or with a little shuffling, you may c
hoose
    A sword unbated, and, in a pass of practice,
    Requite him for your father.
  Laer. I
 will do't!
    And for that purpose I'll anoint my sword.
    I bought an unction of a mountebank
,
    So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
    Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
    C
ollected from all simples that have virtue
    Under the moon, can save the thing from death
    T
his is but scratch'd withal. I'll touch my point
    With this contagion, that, if I gall him sligh
tly,
    It may be death.
  King. Let's further think of this,
    Weigh what convenience both of
 time and means
    May fit us to our shape. If this should fall,
    And that our drift look thro
ugh our bad performance.
    'Twere better not assay'd. Therefore this project
    Should have a b
ack or second, that might hold
    If this did blast in proof. Soft! let me see.
    We'll make a 
solemn wager on your cunnings-
    I ha't!
    When in your motion you are hot and dry-
    As ma
ke your bouts more violent to that end-
    And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepar'd him
  
  A chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,
    If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
   
 Our purpose may hold there.- But stay, what noise,

                           Enter Queen.

  
  How now, sweet queen?
  Queen. One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
    So fast they follow. 
Your sister's drown'd, Laertes.
  Laer. Drown'd! O, where?
  Queen. There is a willow grows aslant
 a brook,
    That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream.
    There with fantastic garlands d
id she come
    Of crowflowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,
    That liberal shepherds giv
e a grosser name,
    But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them.
    There on the pendant
 boughs her coronet weeds
    Clamb'ring to hang, an envious sliver broke,
    When down her weedy
 trophies and herself
    Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide
    And, mermaid-like
, awhile they bore her up;
    Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes,
    As one incapable
 of her own distress,
    Or like a creature native and indued
    Unto that element; but long it 
could not be
    Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
    Pull'd the poor wretch from h
er melodious lay
    To muddy death.
  Laer. Alas, then she is drown'd?
  Queen. Drown'd, drown'd
.
  Laer. Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
    And therefore I forbid my tears; but yet

    It is our trick; nature her custom holds,
    Let shame say what it will. When these are gone,

    The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord.
    I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze
  
  But that this folly douts it.                          Exit.
  King. Let's follow, Gertrude.
   
 How much I had to do to calm his rage I
    Now fear I this will give it start again;
    Therefo
re let's follow.
                                                         Exeunt.

ACT V. Scene I.
Elsinore. A churchyard.

Enter two Clowns, [with spades and pickaxes].

  C
lown. Is she to be buried in Christian burial when she
wilfully
    seeks her own salvation?
  Ot
her. I tell thee she is; therefore make her grave straight.
    The crowner hath sate on her, and f
inds it Christian burial.
  Clown. How can that be, unless she drown'd herself in her own
    defe
nce?
  Other. Why, 'tis found so.
  Clown. It must be se offendendo; it cannot be else. For here

lies
    the point: if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act; and
an
    act hath three bran
ches-it is to act, to do, and to perform;
    argal, she drown'd herself wittingly.
  Other. Nay, 
but hear you, Goodman Delver!
  Clown. Give me leave. Here lies the water; good. Here stands
the

    man; good. If the man go to this water and drown himself, it
is,
    will he nill he, he goes-
 mark you that. But if the water
come to
    him and drown him, he drowns not himself. Argal, he t
hat is
not
    guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.
  Other. But is this law?
  Cl
own. Ay, marry, is't- crowner's quest law.
  Other. Will you ha' the truth an't? If this had not be
en a
    gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o' Christian
burial.
  Clown. Why, there th
ou say'st! And the more pity that great
folk
    should have count'nance in this world to drown or
 hang
themselves
    more than their even-Christian. Come, my spade! There is no
    ancient gent
lemen but gard'ners, ditchers, and grave-makers.
They
    hold up Adam's profession.
  Other. Was
 he a gentleman?
  Clown. 'A was the first that ever bore arms.
  Other. Why, he had none.
  Clow
n. What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the
Scripture?
    The Scripture says Adam digg'd
. Could he dig without arms?
I'll
    put another question to thee. If thou answerest me not to th
e
    purpose, confess thyself-
  Other. Go to!
  Clown. What is he that builds stronger than eit
her the mason,
the
    shipwright, or the carpenter?
  Other. The gallows-maker; for that frame o
utlives a thousand
    tenants.
  Clown. I like thy wit well, in good faith. The gallows does
wel
l.
    But how does it well? It does well to those that do ill. Now,
    thou dost ill to say the 
gallows is built stronger than the
    church. Argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To't again,

come!
  Other. Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a
    carpenter?
  Clown. Ay, 
tell me that, and unyoke.
  Other. Marry, now I can tell!
  Clown. To't.
  Other. Mass, I cannot 
tell.

                 Enter Hamlet and Horatio afar off.

  Clown. Cudgel thy brains no more a
bout it, for your dull ass
will
    not mend his pace with beating; and when you are ask'd this
 
   question next, say 'a grave-maker.' The houses he makes lasts
    till doomsday. Go, get thee to
 Yaughan; fetch me a stoup of
    liquor.
                                            [Exit Second
 Clown.]


                       [Clown digs and] sings.

       In youth when I did love, did
 love,
         Methought it was very sweet;
       To contract- O- the time for- a- my behove,
 
        O, methought there- a- was nothing- a- meet.

  Ham. Has this fellow no feeling of his bus
iness, that he sings
at
    grave-making?
  Hor. Custom hath made it in him a property of easines
s.
  Ham. 'Tis e'en so. The hand of little employment hath the
daintier
    sense.
  Clown. (sin
gs)
         But age with his stealing steps
           Hath clawed me in his clutch,
         An
d hath shipped me intil the land,
           As if I had never been such.
                        
                    [Throws up a skull.]

  Ham. That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing onc
e. How
the
    knave jowls it to the ground,as if 'twere Cain's jawbone,
that
    did the first 
murther! This might be the pate of a
Politician,
    which this ass now o'erreaches; one that woul
d circumvent
God,
    might it not?
  Hor. It might, my lord.
  Ham. Or of a courtier, which cou
ld say 'Good morrow, sweet
lord!
    How dost thou, good lord?' This might be my Lord Such-a-one,

that
    prais'd my Lord Such-a-one's horse when he meant to beg it-
might
    it not?
  Hor. A
y, my lord.
  Ham. Why, e'en so! and now my Lady Worm's, chapless, and
knock'd
    about the mazz
ard with a sexton's spade. Here's fine
revolution,
    and we had the trick to see't. Did these bo
nes cost no more
the
    breeding but to play at loggets with 'em? Mine ache to think
    on't.

  Clown. (Sings)
         A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,
           For and a shrouding sheet;
 
        O, a Pit of clay for to be made
           For such a guest is meet.
                     
                 Throws up [another skull].

  Ham. There's another. Why may not that be the skull
 of a
lawyer?
    Where be his quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, his
tenures,
    and his t
ricks? Why does he suffer this rude knave now to
knock
    him about the sconce with a dirty shove
l, and will not tell
him
    of his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be in's time
a
   
 great buyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizances,
his
    fines, his double vouchers, hi
s recoveries. Is this the fine
of
    his fines, and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his

fine
    pate full of fine dirt? Will his vouchers vouch him no more
of
    his purchases, and do
uble ones too, than the length and
breadth
    of a pair of indentures? The very conveyances of hi
s lands
will
    scarcely lie in this box; and must th' inheritor himself have
no
    more, ha?

  Hor. Not a jot more, my lord.
  Ham. Is not parchment made of sheepskins?
  Hor. Ay, my lord, A
nd of calveskins too.
  Ham. They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in
that. I
    wi
ll speak to this fellow. Whose grave's this, sirrah?
  Clown. Mine, sir.

    [Sings] O, a pit of
 clay for to be made
              For such a guest is meet.

  Ham. I think it be thine indeed, 
for thou liest in't.
  Clown. You lie out on't, sir, and therefore 'tis not yours.
    For my part
, I do not lie in't, yet it is mine.
  Ham. Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine. 'Ti
s
for
    the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.
  Clown. 'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twi
ll away again from me to you.
  Ham. What man dost thou dig it for?
  Clown. For no man, sir.
  H
am. What woman then?
  Clown. For none neither.
  Ham. Who is to be buried in't?
  Clown. One tha
t was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's
dead.
  Ham. How absolute the knave is! We must spea
k by the card, or
    equivocation will undo us. By the Lord, Horatio, this three
years
    I hav
e taken note of it, the age is grown so picked that the
toe
    of the peasant comes so near the h
eel of the courtier he
galls
    his kibe.- How long hast thou been a grave-maker?
  Clown. Of al
l the days i' th' year, I came to't that day that
our
    last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.
 
 Ham. How long is that since?
  Clown. Cannot you tell that? Every fool can tell that. It was
the

    very day that young Hamlet was born- he that is mad, and sent
    into England.
  Ham. Ay, ma
rry, why was be sent into England?
  Clown. Why, because 'a was mad. 'A shall recover his wits
the
re;
    or, if 'a do not, 'tis no great matter there.
  Ham. Why?
  Clown. 'Twill not he seen in 
him there. There the men are as
mad as
    he.
  Ham. How came he mad?
  Clown. Very strangely, 
they say.
  Ham. How strangely?
  Clown. Faith, e'en with losing his wits.
  Ham. Upon what groun
d?
  Clown. Why, here in Denmark. I have been sexton here, man and
boy
    thirty years.
  Ham. 
How long will a man lie i' th' earth ere he rot?
  Clown. Faith, if 'a be not rotten before 'a die 
(as we have
many
    pocky corses now-a-days that will scarce hold the laying in,
I
    will las
t you some eight year or nine year. A tanner will
last
    you nine year.
  Ham. Why he more than
 another?
  Clown. Why, sir, his hide is so tann'd with his trade that 'a
will
    keep out water
 a great while; and your water is a sore
decayer of
    your whoreson dead body. Here's a skull no
w. This skull hath
lien
    you i' th' earth three-and-twenty years.
  Ham. Whose was it?
  Clow
n. A whoreson, mad fellow's it was. Whose do you think it
was?
  Ham. Nay, I know not.
  Clown. A
 pestilence on him for a mad rogue! 'A pour'd a flagon
of
    Rhenish on my head once. This same s
kull, sir, was Yorick's
    skull, the King's jester.
  Ham. This?
  Clown. E'en that.
  Ham. Le
t me see. [Takes the skull.] Alas, poor Yorick! I knew
him,
    Horatio. A fellow of infinite jest
, of most excellent fancy.
He
    hath borne me on his back a thousand times. And now how
abhorre
d
    in my imagination it is! My gorge rises at it. Here hung
those
    lips that I have kiss'd 
I know not how oft. Where be your
gibes
    now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merrime
nt that
    were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock
your
    own grinning? Qui
te chap- fall'n? Now get you to my lady's
    chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, t
o this
    favour she must come. Make her laugh at that. Prithee,
Horatio,
    tell me one thing.

  Hor. What's that, my lord?
  Ham. Dost thou think Alexander look'd o' this fashion i' th'
eart
h?
  Hor. E'en so.
  Ham. And smelt so? Pah!
                                          [Puts down
 the skull.]
  Hor. E'en so, my lord.
  Ham. To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not

    imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it
    stopping a bunghole?
  Hor
. 'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.
  Ham. No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him 
thither with
modesty
    enough, and likelihood to lead it; as thus: Alexander died,
    Alexande
r was buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust
is
    earth; of earth we make loam; and why
 of that loam (whereto
he
    was converted) might they not stop a beer barrel?
    Imperious Cae
sar, dead and turn'd to clay,
    Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.
    O, that that earth 
which kept the world in awe
    Should patch a wall t' expel the winter's flaw!
    But soft! but 
soft! aside! Here comes the King-

    Enter [priests with] a coffin [in funeral procession], King
,
             Queen, Laertes, with Lords attendant.]

    The Queen, the courtiers. Who is this 
they follow?
    And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken
    The corse they follow did with 
desp'rate hand
    Fordo it own life. 'Twas of some estate.
    Couch we awhile, and mark.
      
                                   [Retires with Horatio.]

  Laer. What ceremony else?
  Ham. Th
at is Laertes,
    A very noble youth. Mark.
  Laer. What ceremony else?
  Priest. Her obsequies 
have been as far enlarg'd
    As we have warranty. Her death was doubtful;
    And, but that great
 command o'ersways the order,
    She should in ground unsanctified have lodg'd
    Till the last 
trumpet. For charitable prayers,
    Shards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on her.
    Yet 
here she is allow'd her virgin rites,
    Her maiden strewments, and the bringing home
    Of bell
 and burial.
  Laer. Must there no more be done?
  Priest. No more be done.
    We should profane
 the service of the dead
    To sing a requiem and such rest to her
    As to peace-parted souls.

  Laer. Lay her i' th' earth;
    And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
    May violets spring! 
I tell thee, churlish priest,
    A minist'ring angel shall my sister be
    When thou liest howli
ng.
  Ham. What, the fair Ophelia?
  Queen. Sweets to the sweet! Farewell.
                      
                       [Scatters flowers.]
    I hop'd thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
 
   I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
    And not have strew'd thy grave.
  Laer.
 O, treble woe
    Fall ten times treble on that cursed head
    Whose wicked deed thy most ingeni
ous sense
    Depriv'd thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,
    Till I have caught her once more in
 mine arms.
                                             Leaps in the grave.
    Now pile your dus
t upon the quick and dead
    Till of this flat a mountain you have made
    T' o'ertop old Pelion
 or the skyish head
    Of blue Olympus.
  Ham. [comes forward] What is he whose grief
    Bears 
such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow
    Conjures the wand'ring stars, and makes them stand
  
  Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,
    Hamlet the Dane.                    [Leaps in after L
aertes.
  Laer. The devil take thy soul!
                                            [Grapples wit
h him].
  Ham. Thou pray'st not well.
    I prithee take thy fingers from my throat;
    For, tho
ugh I am not splenitive and rash,
    Yet have I in me something dangerous,
    Which let thy wisd
om fear. Hold off thy hand!
  King. Pluck them asunder.
  Queen. Hamlet, Hamlet!
  All. Gentlemen
!
  Hor. Good my lord, be quiet.
             [The Attendants part them, and they come out of the

                                                         grave.]
  Ham. Why, I will fight with him
 upon this theme
    Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
  Queen. O my son, what theme?
  Ham. I
 lov'd Ophelia. Forty thousand brothers
    Could not (with all their quantity of love)
    Make u
p my sum. What wilt thou do for her?
  King. O, he is mad, Laertes.
  Queen. For love of God, forb
ear him!
  Ham. 'Swounds, show me what thou't do.
    Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't t
ear thyself?
    Woo't drink up esill? eat a crocodile?
    I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whin
e?
    To outface me with leaping in her grave?
    Be buried quick with her, and so will I.
    
And if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
    Millions of acres on us, till our ground,
    S
ingeing his pate against the burning zone,
    Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
    I
'll rant as well as thou.
  Queen. This is mere madness;
    And thus a while the fit will work on
 him.
    Anon, as patient as the female dove
    When that her golden couplets are disclos'd,
  
  His silence will sit drooping.
  Ham. Hear you, sir!
    What is the reason that you use me thus
?
    I lov'd you ever. But it is no matter.
    Let Hercules himself do what he may,
    The cat
 will mew, and dog will have his day.
Exit.
  King. I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.
   
                                                Exit Horatio.
    [To Laertes] Strengthen your pati
ence in our last night's
speech.
    We'll put the matter to the present push.-
    Good Gertrude
, set some watch over your son.-
    This grave shall have a living monument.
    An hour of quiet
 shortly shall we see;
    Till then in patience our proceeding be.
                              
                           Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A hall in the Castle.

Enter Haml
et and Horatio.

  Ham. So much for this, sir; now shall you see the other.
    You do remember a
ll the circumstance?
  Hor. Remember it, my lord!
  Ham. Sir, in my heart there was a kind of figh
ting
    That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay
    Worse than the mutinies in the bilboes. 
Rashly-
    And prais'd be rashness for it; let us know,
    Our indiscretion sometime serves us w
ell
    When our deep plots do pall; and that should learn us
    There's a divinity that shapes o
ur ends,
    Rough-hew them how we will-
  Hor. That is most certain.
  Ham. Up from my cabin,
 
   My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
    Grop'd I to find out them; had my desire,
    Fin
ger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew
    To mine own room again; making so bold
    (My fears 
forgetting manners) to unseal
    Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio
    (O royal knav
ery!), an exact command,
    Larded with many several sorts of reasons,
    Importing Denmark's he
alth, and England's too,
    With, hoo! such bugs and goblins in my life-
    That, on the supervi
se, no leisure bated,
    No, not to stay the finding of the axe,
    My head should be struck off
.
  Hor. Is't possible?
  Ham. Here's the commission; read it at more leisure.
    But wilt thou 
bear me how I did proceed?
  Hor. I beseech you.
  Ham. Being thus benetted round with villanies,

    Or I could make a prologue to my brains,
    They had begun the play. I sat me down;
    Devi
s'd a new commission; wrote it fair.
    I once did hold it, as our statists do,
    A baseness to
 write fair, and labour'd much
    How to forget that learning; but, sir, now
    It did me yeoman
's service. Wilt thou know
    Th' effect of what I wrote?
  Hor. Ay, good my lord.
  Ham. An ear
nest conjuration from the King,
    As England was his faithful tributary,
    As love between the
m like the palm might flourish,
    As peace should still her wheaten garland wear
    And stand a
 comma 'tween their amities,
    And many such-like as's of great charge,
    That, on the view an
d knowing of these contents,
    Without debatement further, more or less,
    He should the beare
rs put to sudden death,
    Not shriving time allow'd.
  Hor. How was this seal'd?
  Ham. Why, ev
en in that was heaven ordinant.
    I had my father's signet in my purse,
    Which was the model 
of that Danish seal;
    Folded the writ up in the form of th' other,
    Subscrib'd it, gave't th
' impression, plac'd it safely,
    The changeling never known. Now, the next day
    Was our sea-
fight; and what to this was sequent
    Thou know'st already.
  Hor. So Guildenstern and Rosencran
tz go to't.
  Ham. Why, man, they did make love to this employment!
    They are not near my consc
ience; their defeat
    Does by their own insinuation grow.
    'Tis dangerous when the baser natu
re comes
    Between the pass and fell incensed points
    Of mighty opposites.
  Hor. Why, what 
a king is this!
  Ham. Does it not, thinks't thee, stand me now upon-
    He that hath kill'd my k
ing, and whor'd my mother;
    Popp'd in between th' election and my hopes;
    Thrown out his ang
le for my proper life,
    And with such coz'nage- is't not perfect conscience
    To quit him wit
h this arm? And is't not to be damn'd
    To let this canker of our nature come
    In further evi
l?
  Hor. It must be shortly known to him from England
    What is the issue of the business there
.
  Ham. It will be short; the interim is mine,
    And a man's life is no more than to say 'one.'

    But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
    That to Laertes I forgot myself,
    For by the image
 of my cause I see
    The portraiture of his. I'll court his favours.
    But sure the bravery of
 his grief did put me
    Into a tow'ring passion.
  Hor. Peace! Who comes here?

              
   Enter young Osric, a courtier.

  Osr. Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
  Ham. 
I humbly thank you, sir. [Aside to Horatio] Dost know this
    waterfly?
  Hor. [aside to Hamlet] 
No, my good lord.
  Ham. [aside to Horatio] Thy state is the more gracious; for
'tis a
    vice t
o know him. He hath much land, and fertile. Let a beast
be
    lord of beasts, and his crib shall 
stand at the king's mess.
'Tis
    a chough; but, as I say, spacious in the possession of dirt.


  Osr. Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should
impart
    a thing to you from his 
Majesty.
  Ham. I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit. Put
your
    bonnet to his 
right use. 'Tis for the head.
  Osr. I thank your lordship, it is very hot.
  Ham. No, believe me,
 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly.
  Osr. It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
  Ham. But
 yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my
complexion.
  Osr. Exceedingly, my lord; it is very
 sultry, as 'twere- I
cannot
    tell how. But, my lord, his Majesty bade me signify to you
that

    he has laid a great wager on your head. Sir, this is the
matter-
  Ham. I beseech you remembe
r.
                           [Hamlet moves him to put on his hat.]
  Osr. Nay, good my lord; for 
mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here
is
    newly come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute
g
entleman,
    full of most excellent differences, of very soft society and
    great showing. Inde
ed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the
card
    or calendar of gentry; for you shall find in him
 the
continent of
    what part a gentleman would see.
  Ham. Sir, his definement suffers no perd
ition in you; though, I

    know, to divide him inventorially would dozy th' arithmetic
of
    
memory, and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail.
    But, in the verity of extolment, 
I take him to be a soul of
great
    article, and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as, to

make
    true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror, and who
else
    would trace him, his
 umbrage, nothing more.
  Osr. Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
  Ham. The concernancy
, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our
more
    rawer breath?
  Osr. Sir?
  Hor [aside to Ha
mlet] Is't not possible to understand in
another
    tongue? You will do't, sir, really.
  Ham. W
hat imports the nomination of this gentleman?
  Osr. Of Laertes?
  Hor. [aside] His purse is empty
 already. All's golden words are
    spent.
  Ham. Of him, sir.
  Osr. I know you are not ignoran
t-
  Ham. I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would
not
    much approve me. Well
, sir?
  Osr. You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is-
  Ham. I dare not confess that, 
lest I should compare with him in
    excellence; but to know a man well were to know himself.
  O
sr. I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on
him
    by them, in his meed he's u
nfellowed.
  Ham. What's his weapon?
  Osr. Rapier and dagger.
  Ham. That's two of his weapons- 
but well.
  Osr. The King, sir, hath wager'd with him six Barbary horses;
    against the which he
 has impon'd, as I take it, six French
    rapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, han
gers,
and
    so. Three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy,
    very responsive t
o the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of
    very liberal conceit.
  Ham. What call you the ca
rriages?
  Hor. [aside to Hamlet] I knew you must be edified by the
margent
    ere you had done.

  Osr. The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
  Ham. The phrase would be more germane to the matter
 if we could
    carry cannon by our sides. I would it might be hangers till
then.
    But on! Si
x Barbary horses against six French swords, their
    assigns, and three liberal-conceited carriage
s: that's the
French
    bet against the Danish. Why is this all impon'd, as you call
it?
  Osr.
 The King, sir, hath laid that, in a dozen passes between
    yourself and him, he shall not exceed
 you three hits; he hath
    laid on twelve for nine, and it would come to immediate trial
    if 
your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.
  Ham. How if I answer no?
  Osr. I mean, my lord, the o
pposition of your person in trial.
  Ham. Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please his
Maje
sty,
    it is the breathing time of day with me. Let the foils be
    brought, the gentleman will
ing, and the King hold his
purpose,
    I will win for him if I can; if not, I will gain nothing b
ut
my
    shame and the odd hits.
  Osr. Shall I redeliver you e'en so?
  Ham. To this effect, s
ir, after what flourish your nature will.
  Osr. I commend my duty to your lordship.
  Ham. Yours,
 yours. [Exit Osric.] He does well to commend it
    himself; there are no tongues else for's turn.

  Hor. This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.
  Ham. He did comply with his dug befor
e he suck'd it. Thus has
he,
    and many more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age
dotes

    on, only got the tune of the time and outward habit of
encounter-
    a kind of yesty collect
ion, which carries them through and
    through the most fann'd and winnowed opinions; and do but

blow
    them to their trial-the bubbles are out,

                            Enter a Lord.

 
 Lord. My lord, his Majesty commended him to you by young Osric,
who
    brings back to him, that 
you attend him in the hall. He sends
to
    know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or th
at you
will
    take longer time.
  Ham. I am constant to my purposes; they follow the King's
pl
easure.
    If his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or whensoever,
provided
    I be so able as
 now.
  Lord. The King and Queen and all are coming down.
  Ham. In happy time.
  Lord. The Queen
 desires you to use some gentle entertainment to
    Laertes before you fall to play.
  Ham. She w
ell instructs me.
                                                    [Exit Lord.]
  Hor. You will
 lose this wager, my lord.
  Ham. I do not think so. Since he went into France I have been
in
   
 continual practice. I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst
not
    think how ill all's here ab
out my heart. But it is no matter.
  Hor. Nay, good my lord -
  Ham. It is but foolery; but it is 
such a kind of gaingiving as
    would perhaps trouble a woman.
  Hor. If your mind dislike anythi
ng, obey it. I will forestall
their
    repair hither and say you are not fit.
  Ham. Not a whit,
 we defy augury; there's a special providence
in
    the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not
 to come; if it
be
    not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will
come:
    the 
readiness is all. Since no man knows aught of what he
leaves,
    what is't to leave betimes? Let 
be.

    Enter King, Queen, Laertes, Osric, and Lords, with other
              Attendants with f
oils and gauntlets.
               A table and flagons of wine on it.

  King. Come, Hamlet, come
, and take this hand from me.
                    [The King puts Laertes' hand into Hamlet's.]
  H
am. Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong;
    But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.
   
 This presence knows,
    And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd
    With sore distracti
on. What I have done
    That might your nature, honour, and exception
    Roughly awake, I here p
roclaim was madness.
    Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet.
    If Hamlet from himself be
 taken away,
    And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
    Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet
 denies it.
    Who does it, then? His madness. If't be so,
    Hamlet is of the faction that is w
rong'd;
    His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
    Sir, in this audience,
    Let my disclaiming
 from a purpos'd evil
    Free me so far in your most generous thoughts
    That I have shot my ar
row o'er the house
    And hurt my brother.
  Laer. I am satisfied in nature,
    Whose motive in
 this case should stir me most
    To my revenge. But in my terms of honour
    I stand aloof, and
 will no reconcilement
    Till by some elder masters of known honour
    I have a voice and prece
dent of peace
    To keep my name ungor'd. But till that time
    I do receive your offer'd love l
ike love,
    And will not wrong it.
  Ham. I embrace it freely,
    And will this brother's wage
r frankly play.
    Give us the foils. Come on.
  Laer. Come, one for me.
  Ham. I'll be your foi
l, Laertes. In mine ignorance
    Your skill shall, like a star i' th' darkest night,
    Stick fi
ery off indeed.
  Laer. You mock me, sir.
  Ham. No, by this hand.
  King. Give them the foils, y
oung Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
    You know the wager?
  Ham. Very well, my lord.
    Your Grace has 
laid the odds o' th' weaker side.
  King. I do not fear it, I have seen you both;
    But since he
 is better'd, we have therefore odds.
  Laer. This is too heavy; let me see another.
  Ham. This l
ikes me well. These foils have all a length?
                                                Prepar
e to play.
  Osr. Ay, my good lord.
  King. Set me the stoups of wine upon that table.
    If Ham
let give the first or second hit,
    Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
    Let all the bat
tlements their ordnance fire;
    The King shall drink to Hamlet's better breath,
    And in the c
up an union shall he throw
    Richer than that which four successive kings
    In Denmark's crown
 have worn. Give me the cups;
    And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
    The trumpet to the 
cannoneer without,
    The cannons to the heavens, the heaven to earth,
    'Now the King drinks t
o Hamlet.' Come, begin.
    And you the judges, bear a wary eye.
  Ham. Come on, sir.
  Laer. Com
e, my lord.                                They play.
  Ham. One.
  Laer. No.
  Ham. Judgment!
 
 Osr. A hit, a very palpable hit.
  Laer. Well, again!
  King. Stay, give me drink. Hamlet, this p
earl is thine;
    Here's to thy health.
               [Drum; trumpets sound; a piece goes off [w
ithin].
    Give him the cup.
  Ham. I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile.
    Come. (They
 play.) Another hit. What say you?
  Laer. A touch, a touch; I do confess't.
  King. Our son shall
 win.
  Queen. He's fat, and scant of breath.
    Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows.
  
  The Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
  Ham. Good madam!
  King. Gertrude, do not drink.
 
 Queen. I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.          Drinks.
  King. [aside] It is the poison'd 
cup; it is too late.
  Ham. I dare not drink yet, madam; by-and-by.
  Queen. Come, let me wipe thy
 face.
  Laer. My lord, I'll hit him now.
  King. I do not think't.
  Laer. [aside] And yet it is
 almost against my conscience.
  Ham. Come for the third, Laertes! You but dally.
    Pray you pas
s with your best violence;
    I am afeard you make a wanton of me.
  Laer. Say you so? Come on.  
                             Play.
  Osr. Nothing neither way.
  Laer. Have at you now!
         
       [Laertes wounds Hamlet; then] in scuffling, they
                    change rapiers, [and Ha
mlet wounds Laertes].
  King. Part them! They are incens'd.
  Ham. Nay come! again!               
          The Queen falls.

  Osr. Look to the Queen there, ho!
  Hor. They bleed on both sides. 
How is it, my lord?
  Osr. How is't, Laertes?
  Laer. Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osri
c.
    I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.
  Ham. How does the Queen?
  King. She sounds 
to see them bleed.
  Queen. No, no! the drink, the drink! O my dear Hamlet!
    The drink, the dri
nk! I am poison'd.                 [Dies.]
  Ham. O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd.
    Treac
hery! Seek it out.
                                                [Laertes falls.]
  Laer. It is 
here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain;
    No medicine in the world can do thee good.
    In thee t
here is not half an hour of life.
    The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
    Unbated and e
nvenom'd. The foul practice
    Hath turn'd itself on me. Lo, here I lie,
    Never to rise again.
 Thy mother's poison'd.
    I can no more. The King, the King's to blame.
  Ham. The point envenom
'd too?
    Then, venom, to thy work.                    Hurts the King.
  All. Treason! treason!

  King. O, yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt.
  Ham. Here, thou incestuous, murd'rous, damned 
Dane,
    Drink off this potion! Is thy union here?
    Follow my mother.                         
        King dies.
  Laer. He is justly serv'd.
    It is a poison temper'd by himself.
    Excha
nge forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet.
    Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
    Nor 
thine on me!                                       Dies.
  Ham. Heaven make thee free of it! I foll
ow thee.
    I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!
    You that look pale and tremble at this
 chance,
    That are but mutes or audience to this act,
    Had I but time (as this fell sergeant
, Death,
    Is strict in his arrest) O, I could tell you-
    But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;

    Thou liv'st; report me and my cause aright
    To the unsatisfied.
  Hor. Never believe it.

    I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.
    Here's yet some liquor left.
  Ham. As th'art a ma
n,
    Give me the cup. Let go! By heaven, I'll ha't.
    O good Horatio, what a wounded name
   
 (Things standing thus unknown) shall live behind me!
    If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,

    Absent thee from felicity awhile,
    And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
    To
 tell my story.         [March afar off, and shot within.]
    What warlike noise is this?
  Osr. 
Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
    To the ambassadors of England gives
    This
 warlike volley.
  Ham. O, I die, Horatio!
    The potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit.
    I
 cannot live to hear the news from England,
    But I do prophesy th' election lights
    On Forti
nbras. He has my dying voice.
    So tell him, with th' occurrents, more and less,
    Which have 
solicited- the rest is silence.             Dies.
  Hor. Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, swee
t prince,
    And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
                                       
          [March within.]
    Why does the drum come hither?

    Enter Fortinbras and English Am
bassadors, with Drum,
                  Colours, and Attendants.

  Fort. Where is this sight?
 
 Hor. What is it you will see?
    If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
  Fort. This quar
ry cries on havoc. O proud Death,
    What feast is toward in thine eternal cell
    That thou so 
many princes at a shot
    So bloodily hast struck.
  Ambassador. The sight is dismal;
    And ou
r affairs from England come too late.
    The ears are senseless that should give us hearing
    T
o tell him his commandment is fulfill'd
    That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.
    Where 
should we have our thanks?
  Hor. Not from his mouth,
    Had it th' ability of life to thank you.

    He never gave commandment for their death.
    But since, so jump upon this bloody question,

    You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
    Are here arriv'd, give order that these bo
dies
    High on a stage be placed to the view;
    And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
 
   How these things came about. So shall you hear
    Of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts;
    Of
 accidental judgments, casual slaughters;
    Of deaths put on by cunning and forc'd cause;
    An
d, in this upshot, purposes mistook
    Fall'n on th' inventors' heads. All this can I
    Truly d
eliver.
  Fort. Let us haste to hear it,
    And call the noblest to the audience.
    For me, wi
th sorrow I embrace my fortune.
    I have some rights of memory in this kingdom
    Which now, to
 claim my vantage doth invite me.
  Hor. Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
    And from hi
s mouth whose voice will draw on more.
    But let this same be presently perform'd,
    Even whil
e men's minds are wild, lest more mischance
    On plots and errors happen.
  Fort. Let four capta
ins
    Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage;
    For he was likely, had he been put on,
    T
o have prov'd most royally; and for his passage
    The soldiers' music and the rites of war
    S
peak loudly for him.
    Take up the bodies. Such a sight as this
    Becomes the field but here s
hows much amiss.
    Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
            Exeunt marching; after the which a pe
al of ordnance
                                                   are shot off.

ACT I. Scene I.
Elsinore. A platform before the Castle.

En
ter two Sentinels-[first,] Francisco, [who paces up and down
at his post; then] Bernardo, [who appr
oaches him].

  Ber. Who's there?
  Fran. Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.
  Ber. Long
 live the King!
  Fran. Bernardo?
  Ber. He.
  Fran. You come most carefully upon your hour.
  B
er. 'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.
  Fran. For this relief much thanks. 'Tis b
itter cold,
    And I am sick at heart.
  Ber. Have you had quiet guard?
  Fran. Not a mouse stir
ring.
  Ber. Well, good night.
    If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
    The rivals of my wat
ch, bid them make haste.

                    Enter Horatio and Marcellus.

  Fran. I think I he
ar them. Stand, ho! Who is there?
  Hor. Friends to this ground.
  Mar. And liegemen to the Dane.

  Fran. Give you good night.
  Mar. O, farewell, honest soldier.
    Who hath reliev'd you?
  Fr
an. Bernardo hath my place.
    Give you good night.                                   Exit.
  Mar
. Holla, Bernardo!
  Ber. Say-
    What, is Horatio there ?
  Hor. A piece of him.
  Ber. Welcom
e, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.
  Mar. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
  Ber. I
 have seen nothing.
  Mar. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
    And will not let belief take hol
d of him
    Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.
    Therefore I have entreated him alo
ng,
    With us to watch the minutes of this night,
    That, if again this apparition come,
    
He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
  Hor. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
  Ber. Sit down awh
ile,
    And let us once again assail your ears,
    That are so fortified against our story,
   
 What we two nights have seen.
  Hor. Well, sit we down,
    And let us hear Bernardo speak of thi
s.
  Ber. Last night of all,
    When yond same star that's westward from the pole
    Had made h
is course t' illume that part of heaven
    Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
    The bell
 then beating one-

                        Enter Ghost.

  Mar. Peace! break thee off! Look whe
re it comes again!
  Ber. In the same figure, like the King that's dead.
  Mar. Thou art a scholar
; speak to it, Horatio.
  Ber. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.
  Hor. Most like. It 
harrows me with fear and wonder.
  Ber. It would be spoke to.
  Mar. Question it, Horatio.
  Hor.
 What art thou that usurp'st this time of night
    Together with that fair and warlike form
    I
n which the majesty of buried Denmark
    Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!
  Ma
r. It is offended.
  Ber. See, it stalks away!
  Hor. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!
  
                                                   Exit Ghost.
  Mar. 'Tis gone and will not answer
.
  Ber. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale.
    Is not this something more than fantasy?

    What think you on't?
  Hor. Before my God, I might not this believe
    Without the sensible
 and true avouch
    Of mine own eyes.
  Mar. Is it not like the King?
  Hor. As thou art to thys
elf.
    Such was the very armour he had on
    When he th' ambitious Norway combated.
    So fro
wn'd he once when, in an angry parle,
    He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
    'Tis strang
e.
  Mar. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
    With martial stalk hath he gone by ou
r watch.
  Hor. In what particular thought to work I know not;
    But, in the gross and scope of 
my opinion,
    This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
  Mar. Good now, sit down, and tell
 me he that knows,
    Why this same strict and most observant watch
    So nightly toils the subj
ect of the land,
    And why such daily cast of brazen cannon
    And foreign mart for implements 
of war;
    Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
    Does not divide the Sunday from t
he week.
    What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
    Doth make the night joint-labourer w
ith the day?
    Who is't that can inform me?
  Hor. That can I.
    At least, the whisper goes s
o. Our last king,
    Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
    Was, as you know, by Fortinbras
 of Norway,
    Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
    Dar'd to the combat; in which our 
valiant Hamlet
    (For so this side of our known world esteem'd him)
    Did slay this Fortinbras
; who, by a seal'd compact,
    Well ratified by law and heraldry,
    Did forfeit, with his life,
 all those his lands
    Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror;
    Against the which a moiet
y competent
    Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
    To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
 
   Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant
    And carriage of the article design'd,
    
His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
    Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
    Hath in
 the skirts of Norway, here and there,
    Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
    For food an
d diet, to some enterprise
    That hath a stomach in't; which is no other,
    As it doth well ap
pear unto our state,
    But to recover of us, by strong hand
    And terms compulsatory, those fo
resaid lands
    So by his father lost; and this, I take it,
    Is the main motive of our prepara
tions,
    The source of this our watch, and the chief head
    Of this post-haste and romage in t
he land.
  Ber. I think it be no other but e'en so.
    Well may it sort that this portentous figu
re
    Comes armed through our watch, so like the King
    That was and is the question of these w
ars.
  Hor. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
    In the most high and palmy state of Rome,

    A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
    The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead

    Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;
    As stars with trains of fire, and dews of bloo
d,
    Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
    Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands

    Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.
    And even the like precurse of fierce events,
   
 As harbingers preceding still the fates
    And prologue to the omen coming on,
    Have heaven a
nd earth together demonstrated
    Unto our climature and countrymen.

                      Ente
r Ghost again.

    But soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again!
    I'll cross it, though it blas
t me.- Stay illusion!
                                               Spreads his arms.
    If thou
 hast any sound, or use of voice,
    Speak to me.
    If there be any good thing to be done,
   
 That may to thee do ease, and, race to me,
    Speak to me.
    If thou art privy to thy country'
s fate,
    Which happily foreknowing may avoid,
    O, speak!
    Or if thou hast uphoarded in t
hy life
    Extorted treasure in the womb of earth
    (For which, they say, you spirits oft walk 
in death),
                                                 The cock crows.
    Speak of it! Stay,
 and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!
  Mar. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
  Hor. Do, if it wi
ll not stand.
  Ber. 'Tis here!
  Hor. 'Tis here!
  Mar. 'Tis gone!
                            
                         Exit Ghost.
    We do it wrong, being so majestical,
    To offer it the 
show of violence;
    For it is as the air, invulnerable,
    And our vain blows malicious mockery
.
  Ber. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
  Hor. And then it started, like a guilty thin
g
    Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
    The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
    Dot
h with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
    Awake the god of day; and at his warning,
    Whet
her in sea or fire, in earth or air,
    Th' extravagant and erring spirit hies
    To his confine
; and of the truth herein
    This present object made probation.
  Mar. It faded on the crowing o
f the cock.
    Some say that ever, 'gainst that season comes
    Wherein our Saviour's birth is c
elebrated,
    The bird of dawning singeth all night long;
    And then, they say, no spirit dare 
stir abroad,
    The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,
    No fairy takes, nor witch h
ath power to charm,
    So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
  Hor. So have I heard and do in 
part believe it.
    But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
    Walks o'er the dew of yon high
 eastward hill.
    Break we our watch up; and by my advice
    Let us impart what we have seen to
-night
    Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
    This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.

    Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
    As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
 
   Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
    Where we shall find him most conveniently.      
     Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A room of state in the Castle.

Flourish. [Enter Claudi
us, King of Denmark, Gertrude the Queen,
Hamlet,
Polonius, Laertes and his sister Ophelia, [Voltem
and, Cornelius,]
Lords Attendant.

  King. Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
    The
 memory be green, and that it us befitted
    To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom
 
   To be contracted in one brow of woe,
    Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
    That
 we with wisest sorrow think on him
    Together with remembrance of ourselves.
    Therefore our 
sometime sister, now our queen,
    Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,
    Have we, as 
'twere with a defeated joy,
    With an auspicious, and a dropping eye,
    With mirth in funeral,
 and with dirge in marriage,
    In equal scale weighing delight and dole,
    Taken to wife; nor 
have we herein barr'd
    Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
    With this affair along. 
For all, our thanks.
    Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
    Holding a weak supposal
 of our worth,
    Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
    Our state to be disjoint and o
ut of frame,
    Colleagued with this dream of his advantage,
    He hath not fail'd to pester us 
with message
    Importing the surrender of those lands
    Lost by his father, with all bands of 
law,
    To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
    Now for ourself and for this time of me
eting.
    Thus much the business is: we have here writ
    To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,

    Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears
    Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress
    Hi
s further gait herein, in that the levies,
    The lists, and full proportions are all made
    Ou
t of his subject; and we here dispatch
    You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,
    For bearer
s of this greeting to old Norway,
    Giving to you no further personal power
    To business with
 the King, more than the scope
    Of these dilated articles allow.            [Gives a paper.]
  
  Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
  Cor., Volt. In that, and all things, will we sh
ow our duty.
  King. We doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell.
                                 Exeu
nt Voltemand and Cornelius.
    And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
    You told us of som
e suit. What is't, Laertes?
    You cannot speak of reason to the Dane
    And lose your voice. Wh
at wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
    That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
    The head is not 
more native to the heart,
    The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
    Than is the throne of D
enmark to thy father.
    What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
  Laer. My dread lord,
    Your leave 
and favour to return to France;
    From whence though willingly I came to Denmark
    To show my 
duty in your coronation,
    Yet now I must confess, that duty done,
    My thoughts and wishes be
nd again toward France
    And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
  King. Have you your f
ather's leave? What says Polonius?
  Pol. He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
    By lab
oursome petition, and at last
    Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent.
    I do beseech you giv
e him leave to go.
  King. Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,
    And thy best graces spe
nd it at thy will!
    But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son-
  Ham. [aside] A little more than ki
n, and less than kind!
  King. How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
  Ham. Not so, my lord
. I am too much i' th' sun.
  Queen. Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
    And let thine e
ye look like a friend on Denmark.
    Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
    Seek for thy noble 
father in the dust.
    Thou know'st 'tis common. All that lives must die,
    Passing through nat
ure to eternity.
  Ham. Ay, madam, it is common.
  Queen. If it be,
    Why seems it so particula
r with thee?
  Ham. Seems, madam, Nay, it is. I know not 'seems.'
    'Tis not alone my inky cloak
, good mother,
    Nor customary suits of solemn black,
    Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath
,
    No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
    Nor the dejected havior of the visage,
    Toget
her with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
    'That can denote me truly. These indeed seem,
    
For they are actions that a man might play;
    But I have that within which passeth show-
    The
se but the trappings and the suits of woe.
  King. 'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamle
t,
    To give these mourning duties to your father;
    But you must know, your father lost a fat
her;
    That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
    In filial obligation for some term

    To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever
    In obstinate condolement is a course
    Of imp
ious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief;
    It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
    A heart u
nfortified, a mind impatient,
    An understanding simple and unschool'd;
    For what we know mus
t be, and is as common
    As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
    Why should we in our peevish
 opposition
    Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
    A fault against the dead, a fau
lt to nature,
    To reason most absurd, whose common theme
    Is death of fathers, and who still
 hath cried,
    From the first corse till he that died to-day,
    'This must be so.' We pray you
 throw to earth
    This unprevailing woe, and think of us
    As of a father; for let the world t
ake note
    You are the most immediate to our throne,
    And with no less nobility of love
    
Than that which dearest father bears his son
    Do I impart toward you. For your intent
    In go
ing back to school in Wittenberg,
    It is most retrograde to our desire;
    And we beseech you,
 bend you to remain
    Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
    Our chiefest courtier, cousi
n, and our son.
  Queen. Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.
    I pray thee stay with us
, go not to Wittenberg.
  Ham. I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
  King. Why, 'tis a loving 
and a fair reply.
    Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come.
    This gentle and unforc'd accord o
f Hamlet
    Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,
    No jocund health that Denmark drinks 
to-day
    But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
    And the King's rouse the heaven shal
l bruit again,
    Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.
                                Flourish
. Exeunt all but Hamlet.
  Ham. O that this too too solid flesh would melt,
    Thaw, and resolve 
itself into a dew!
    Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
    His canon 'gainst self-slaughter!
 O God! God!
    How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
    Seem to me all the uses of this worl
d!
    Fie on't! ah, fie! 'Tis an unweeded garden
    That grows to seed; things rank and gross in
 nature
    Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
    But two months dead! Nay, not so m
uch, not two.
    So excellent a king, that was to this
    Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my m
other
    That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
    Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and 
earth!
    Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him
    As if increase of appetite had grown
 
   By what it fed on; and yet, within a month-
    Let me not think on't! Frailty, thy name is woma
n!-
    A little month, or ere those shoes were old
    With which she followed my poor father's b
ody
    Like Niobe, all tears- why she, even she
    (O God! a beast that wants discourse of reaso
n
    Would have mourn'd longer) married with my uncle;
    My father's brother, but no more like 
my father
    Than I to Hercules. Within a month,
    Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears

    Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
    She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
    W
ith such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
    It is not, nor it cannot come to good.
    But break 
my heart, for I must hold my tongue!

          Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo.

  Hor. 
Hail to your lordship!
  Ham. I am glad to see you well.
    Horatio!- or I do forget myself.
  H
or. The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
  Ham. Sir, my good friend- I'll change that nam
e with you.
    And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?
    Marcellus?
  Mar. My good lord!

  Ham. I am very glad to see you.- [To Bernardo] Good even, sir.-

    But what, in faith, make yo
u from Wittenberg?
  Hor. A truant disposition, good my lord.
  Ham. I would not hear your enemy s
ay so,
    Nor shall you do my ear that violence
    To make it truster of your own report
    Ag
ainst yourself. I know you are no truant.
    But what is your affair in Elsinore?
    We'll teach
 you to drink deep ere you depart.
  Hor. My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
  Ham. I p
rithee do not mock me, fellow student.
    I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
  Hor. Indee
d, my lord, it followed hard upon.
  Ham. Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats
    Did
 coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
    Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
    Or eve
r I had seen that day, Horatio!
    My father- methinks I see my father.
  Hor. O, where, my lord?

  Ham. In my mind's eye, Horatio.
  Hor. I saw him once. He was a goodly king.
  Ham. He was a m
an, take him for all in all.
    I shall not look upon his like again.
  Hor. My lord, I think I s
aw him yesternight.
  Ham. Saw? who?
  Hor. My lord, the King your father.
  Ham. The King my fat
her?
  Hor. Season your admiration for a while
    With an attent ear, till I may deliver
    Upo
n the witness of these gentlemen,
    This marvel to you.
  Ham. For God's love let me hear!
  Ho
r. Two nights together had these gentlemen
    (Marcellus and Bernardo) on their watch
    In the 
dead vast and middle of the night
    Been thus encount'red. A figure like your father,
    Armed 
at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
    Appears before them and with solemn march
    Goes slow and statel
y by them. Thrice he walk'd
    By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
    Within his trunche
on's length; whilst they distill'd
    Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
    Stand dumb and sp
eak not to him. This to me
    In dreadful secrecy impart they did,
    And I with them the third 
night kept the watch;
    Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
    Form of the thing, each 
word made true and good,
    The apparition comes. I knew your father.
    These hands are not mor
e like.
  Ham. But where was this?
  Mar. My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
  Ham. Did
 you not speak to it?
  Hor. My lord, I did;
    But answer made it none. Yet once methought
    
It lifted up it head and did address
    Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
    But even th
en the morning cock crew loud,
    And at the sound it shrunk in haste away
    And vanish'd from 
our sight.
  Ham. 'Tis very strange.
  Hor. As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
    And we
 did think it writ down in our duty
    To let you know of it.
  Ham. Indeed, indeed, sirs. But th
is troubles me.
    Hold you the watch to-night?
  Both [Mar. and Ber.] We do, my lord.
  Ham. Ar
m'd, say you?
  Both. Arm'd, my lord.
  Ham. From top to toe?
  Both. My lord, from head to foot.

  Ham. Then saw you not his face?
  Hor. O, yes, my lord! He wore his beaver up.
  Ham. What, lo
ok'd he frowningly.
  Hor. A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
  Ham. Pale or red?
  Hor.
 Nay, very pale.
  Ham. And fix'd his eyes upon you?
  Hor. Most constantly.
  Ham. I would I had
 been there.
  Hor. It would have much amaz'd you.
  Ham. Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
 
 Hor. While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
  Both. Longer, longer.
  Hor. Not when 
I saw't.
  Ham. His beard was grizzled- no?
  Hor. It was, as I have seen it in his life,
    A s
able silver'd.
  Ham. I will watch to-night.
    Perchance 'twill walk again.
  Hor. I warr'nt it
 will.
  Ham. If it assume my noble father's person,
    I'll speak to it, though hell itself shou
ld gape
    And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
    If you have hitherto conceal'd this sigh
t,
    Let it be tenable in your silence still;
    And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
    G
ive it an understanding but no tongue.
    I will requite your loves. So, fare you well.
    Upon 
the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
    I'll visit you.
  All. Our duty to your honour.
  Ham
. Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell.
                                        Exeunt [all but Ham
let].
    My father's spirit- in arms? All is not well.
    I doubt some foul play. Would the nigh
t were come!
    Till then sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,
    Though all the earth o'er
whelm them, to men's eyes.
Exit.




Scene III.
Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius.


Enter Laertes and Ophelia.

  Laer. My necessaries are embark'd. Farewell.
    And, sister, as t
he winds give benefit
    And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
    But let me hear from you.
  
Oph. Do you doubt that?
  Laer. For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,
    Hold it a fashion,
 and a toy in blood;
    A violet in the youth of primy nature,
    Forward, not permanent- sweet,
 not lasting;
    The perfume and suppliance of a minute;
    No more.
  Oph. No more but so?
  
Laer. Think it no more.
    For nature crescent does not grow alone
    In thews and bulk; but as 
this temple waxes,
    The inward service of the mind and soul
    Grows wide withal. Perhaps he l
oves you now,
    And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
    The virtue of his will; but you mus
t fear,
    His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
    For he himself is subject to his b
irth.
    He may not, as unvalued persons do,
    Carve for himself, for on his choice depends
  
  The safety and health of this whole state,
    And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd
  
  Unto the voice and yielding of that body
    Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you
,
    It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
    As he in his particular act and place
    May 
give his saying deed; which is no further
    Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
    Then
 weigh what loss your honour may sustain
    If with too credent ear you list his songs,
    Or lo
se your heart, or your chaste treasure open
    To his unmast'red importunity.
    Fear it, Opheli
a, fear it, my dear sister,
    And keep you in the rear of your affection,
    Out of the shot an
d danger of desire.
    The chariest maid is prodigal enough
    If she unmask her beauty to the m
oon.
    Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes.
    The canker galls the infants of the spri
ng
    Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd,
    And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
   
 Contagious blastments are most imminent.
    Be wary then; best safety lies in fear.
    Youth to
 itself rebels, though none else near.
  Oph. I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep
    As w
atchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
    Do not as some ungracious pastors do,
    Show me t
he steep and thorny way to heaven,
    Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
    Himself t
he primrose path of dalliance treads
    And recks not his own rede.
  Laer. O, fear me not!

  
                     Enter Polonius.

    I stay too long. But here my father comes.
    A double
 blessing is a double grace;
    Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
  Pol. Yet here, Laertes? Ab
oard, aboard, for shame!
    The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
    And you are stay'd fo
r. There- my blessing with thee!
    And these few precepts in thy memory
    Look thou character.
 Give thy thoughts no tongue,
    Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.
    Be thou familiar, bu
t by no means vulgar:
    Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
    Grapple them unto
 thy soul with hoops of steel;
    But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
    Of each new-hat
ch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware
    Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,
    Bear't that th' op
posed may beware of thee.
    Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice;
    Take each man's cen
sure, but reserve thy judgment.
    Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
    But not express'd i
n fancy; rich, not gaudy;
    For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
    And they in France of the
 best rank and station
    Are most select and generous, chief in that.
    Neither a borrower nor
 a lender be;
    For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
    And borrowing dulls the edge of h
usbandry.
    This above all- to thine own self be true,
    And it must follow, as the night the 
day,
    Thou canst not then be false to any man.
    Farewell. My blessing season this in thee!

  Laer. Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
  Pol. The time invites you. Go, your servants ten
d.
  Laer. Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well
    What I have said to you.
  Oph. 'Tis in my me
mory lock'd,
    And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
  Laer. Farewell.                     
                     Exit.
  Pol. What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?
  Oph. So please you, s
omething touching the Lord Hamlet.
  Pol. Marry, well bethought!
    'Tis told me he hath very oft
 of late
    Given private time to you, and you yourself
    Have of your audience been most free 
and bounteous.
    If it be so- as so 'tis put on me,
    And that in way of caution- I must tell 
you
    You do not understand yourself so clearly
    As it behooves my daughter and your honour.

    What is between you? Give me up the truth.
  Oph. He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders

    Of his affection to me.
  Pol. Affection? Pooh! You speak like a green girl,
    Unsifted in 
such perilous circumstance.
    Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
  Oph. I do not know
, my lord, what I should think,
  Pol. Marry, I will teach you! Think yourself a baby
    That you
 have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
    Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,
 
   Or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
    Running it thus) you'll tender me a fool.
  O
ph. My lord, he hath importun'd me with love
    In honourable fashion.
  Pol. Ay, fashion you may
 call it. Go to, go to!
  Oph. And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
    With almost 
all the holy vows of heaven.
  Pol. Ay, springes to catch woodcocks! I do know,
    When the blood
 burns, how prodigal the soul
    Lends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter,
    Giving more l
ight than heat, extinct in both
    Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
    You must not tak
e for fire. From this time
    Be something scanter of your maiden presence.
    Set your entreatm
ents at a higher rate
    Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
    Believe so much in him, t
hat he is young,
    And with a larger tether may he walk
    Than may be given you. In few, Ophel
ia,
    Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
    Not of that dye which their investments
 show,
    But mere implorators of unholy suits,
    Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
 
   The better to beguile. This is for all:
    I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth
 
   Have you so slander any moment leisure
    As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
    L
ook to't, I charge you. Come your ways.
  Oph. I shall obey, my lord.
                            
                             Exeunt.




Scene IV.
Elsinore. The platform before the Castle.


Enter Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus.

  Ham. The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
  Hor. I
t is a nipping and an eager air.
  Ham. What hour now?
  Hor. I think it lacks of twelve.
  Mar. 
No, it is struck.
  Hor. Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws near the season
    Wherein the spi
rit held his wont to walk.
                   A flourish of trumpets, and two pieces go off.
    W
hat does this mean, my lord?
  Ham. The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
    Keeps was
sail, and the swagg'ring upspring reels,
    And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
    T
he kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out
    The triumph of his pledge.
  Hor. Is it a custom?
  H
am. Ay, marry, is't;
    But to my mind, though I am native here
    And to the manner born, it is
 a custom
    More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
    This heavy-headed revel east an
d west
    Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations;
    They clip us drunkards and with swini
sh phrase
    Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
    From our achievements, though perform'd a
t height,
    The pith and marrow of our attribute.
    So oft it chances in particular men
    T
hat, for some vicious mole of nature in them,
    As in their birth,- wherein they are not guilty,

    Since nature cannot choose his origin,-
    By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
    Oft bre
aking down the pales and forts of reason,
    Or by some habit that too much o'erleavens
    The f
orm of plausive manners, that these men
    Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
    Being na
ture's livery, or fortune's star,
    Their virtues else- be they as pure as grace,
    As infinit
e as man may undergo-
    Shall in the general censure take corruption
    From that particular fa
ult. The dram of e'il
    Doth all the noble substance often dout To his own scandal.

          
               Enter Ghost.

  Hor. Look, my lord, it comes!
  Ham. Angels and ministers of grace
 defend us!
    Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
    Bring with thee airs from heaven 
or blasts from hell,
    Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
    Thou com'st in such a questionab
le shape
    That I will speak to thee. I'll call thee Hamlet,
    King, father, royal Dane. O, an
swer me?
    Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell
    Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death
,
    Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre
    Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
    
Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws
    To cast thee up again. What may this mean
    That tho
u, dead corse, again in complete steel,
    Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
    Making nig
ht hideous, and we fools of nature
    So horridly to shake our disposition
    With thoughts beyo
nd the reaches of our souls?
    Say, why is this? wherefore? What should we do?
                 
                          Ghost beckons Hamlet.
  Hor. It beckons you to go away with it,
    As i
f it some impartment did desire
    To you alone.
  Mar. Look with what courteous action
    It w
aves you to a more removed ground.
    But do not go with it!
  Hor. No, by no means!
  Ham. It w
ill not speak. Then will I follow it.
  Hor. Do not, my lord!
  Ham. Why, what should be the fear?

    I do not set my life at a pin's fee;
    And for my soul, what can it do to that,
    Being 
a thing immortal as itself?
    It waves me forth again. I'll follow it.
  Hor. What if it tempt y
ou toward the flood, my lord,
    Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
    That beetles o'er his
 base into the sea,
    And there assume some other, horrible form
    Which might deprive your so
vereignty of reason
    And draw you into madness? Think of it.
    The very place puts toys of de
speration,
    Without more motive, into every brain
    That looks so many fadoms to the sea
   
 And hears it roar beneath.
  Ham. It waves me still.
    Go on. I'll follow thee.
  Mar. You sha
ll not go, my lord.
  Ham. Hold off your hands!
  Hor. Be rul'd. You shall not go.
  Ham. My fate
 cries out
    And makes each petty artire in this body
    As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.

                                                [Ghost beckons.]

    Still am I call'd. Unhand me
, gentlemen.
    By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!-
    I say, away!- Go on. I'll 
follow thee.
                                        Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet.
  Hor. He waxes desp
erate with imagination.
  Mar. Let's follow. 'Tis not fit thus to obey him.
  Hor. Have after. To 
what issue will this come?
  Mar. Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
  Hor. Heaven will 
direct it.
  Mar. Nay, let's follow him.
                                                         
Exeunt.




Scene V.
Elsinore. The Castle. Another part of the fortifications.

Enter Ghost 
and Hamlet.

  Ham. Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak! I'll go no further.
  Ghost. Mark me.
  Ha
m. I will.
  Ghost. My hour is almost come,
    When I to sulph'rous and tormenting flames
    Mu
st render up myself.
  Ham. Alas, poor ghost!
  Ghost. Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing

    To what I shall unfold.
  Ham. Speak. I am bound to hear.
  Ghost. So art thou to revenge, whe
n thou shalt hear.
  Ham. What?
  Ghost. I am thy father's spirit,
    Doom'd for a certain term 
to walk the night,
    And for the day confin'd to fast in fires,
    Till the foul crimes done in
 my days of nature
    Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid
    To tell the secrets of 
my prison house,
    I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
    Would harrow up thy soul, freez
e thy young blood,
    Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
    Thy knotted an
d combined locks to part,
    And each particular hair to stand on end
    Like quills upon the fr
etful porcupine.
    But this eternal blazon must not be
    To ears of flesh and blood. List, lis
t, O, list!
    If thou didst ever thy dear father love-
  Ham. O God!
  Ghost. Revenge his foul 
and most unnatural murther.
  Ham. Murther?
  Ghost. Murther most foul, as in the best it is;
   
 But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.
  Ham. Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift

    As meditation or the thoughts of love,
    May sweep to my revenge.
  Ghost. I find thee apt
;
    And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
    That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,

    Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.
    'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orcha
rd,
    A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark
    Is by a forged process of my death
  
  Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth,
    The serpent that did sting thy father's life
    
Now wears his crown.
  Ham. O my prophetic soul!
    My uncle?
  Ghost. Ay, that incestuous, that
 adulterate beast,
    With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts-
    O wicked wit and gif
ts, that have the power
    So to seduce!- won to his shameful lust
    The will of my most seemin
g-virtuous queen.
    O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there,
    From me, whose love was of that 
dignity
    That it went hand in hand even with the vow
    I made to her in marriage, and to decl
ine
    Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
    To those of mine!
    But virtue, as it n
ever will be mov'd,
    Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
    So lust, though to a ra
diant angel link'd,
    Will sate itself in a celestial bed
    And prey on garbage.
    But soft
! methinks I scent the morning air.
    Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
    My custom
 always of the afternoon,
    Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
    With juice of cursed hebona
 in a vial,
    And in the porches of my ears did pour
    The leperous distilment; whose effect

    Holds such an enmity with blood of man
    That swift as quicksilver it courses through
    Th
e natural gates and alleys of the body,
    And with a sudden vigour it doth posset
    And curd, 
like eager droppings into milk,
    The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine;
    And a most i
nstant tetter bark'd about,
    Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust
    All my smooth b
ody.
    Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
    Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispat
ch'd;
    Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
    Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd,
    No 
reckoning made, but sent to my account
    With all my imperfections on my head.
  Ham. O, horribl
e! O, horrible! most horrible!
  Ghost. If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.
    Let not the 
royal bed of Denmark be
    A couch for luxury and damned incest.
    But, howsoever thou pursuest
 this act,
    Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
    Against thy mother aught. Leave h
er to heaven,
    And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge
    To prick and sting her. Fare the
e well at once.
    The glowworm shows the matin to be near
    And gins to pale his uneffectual f
ire.
    Adieu, adieu, adieu! Remember me.                      Exit.

  Ham. O all you host of h
eaven! O earth! What else?
    And shall I couple hell? Hold, hold, my heart!
    And you, my sine
ws, grow not instant old,
    But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?
    Ay, thou poor ghost, whil
e memory holds a seat
    In this distracted globe. Remember thee?
    Yea, from the table of my m
emory
    I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
    All saws of books, all forms, all pressures
 past
    That youth and observation copied there,
    And thy commandment all alone shall live
 
   Within the book and volume of my brain,
    Unmix'd with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!
    O mo
st pernicious woman!
    O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
    My tables! Meet it is I 
set it down
    That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
    At least I am sure it may be 
so in Denmark.        [Writes.]
    So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word:
    It is 'Adieu, ad
ieu! Remember me.'
    I have sworn't.
  Hor. (within) My lord, my lord!

                   Ent
er Horatio and Marcellus.

  Mar. Lord Hamlet!
  Hor. Heaven secure him!
  Ham. So be it!
  Mar
. Illo, ho, ho, my lord!
  Ham. Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.
  Mar. How is't, my noble lo
rd?
  Hor. What news, my lord?
  Mar. O, wonderful!
  Hor. Good my lord, tell it.
  Ham. No, you
 will reveal it.
  Hor. Not I, my lord, by heaven!
  Mar. Nor I, my lord.
  Ham. How say you then
? Would heart of man once think it?
    But you'll be secret?
  Both. Ay, by heaven, my lord.
  H
am. There's neer a villain dwelling in all Denmark
    But he's an arrant knave.
  Hor. There need
s no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
    To tell us this.
  Ham. Why, right! You are in the ri
ght!
    And so, without more circumstance at all,
    I hold it fit that we shake hands and part;

    You, as your business and desires shall point you,
    For every man hath business and desire
,
    Such as it is; and for my own poor part,
    Look you, I'll go pray.
  Hor. These are but w
ild and whirling words, my lord.
  Ham. I am sorry they offend you, heartily;
    Yes, faith, hear
tily.
  Hor. There's no offence, my lord.
  Ham. Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
  
  And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
    It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.

    For your desire to know what is between us,
    O'ermaster't as you may. And now, good friend
s,
    As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,
    Give me one poor request.
  Hor. What is't
, my lord? We will.
  Ham. Never make known what you have seen to-night.
  Both. My lord, we will 
not.
  Ham. Nay, but swear't.
  Hor. In faith,
    My lord, not I.
  Mar. Nor I, my lord- in fai
th.
  Ham. Upon my sword.
  Mar. We have sworn, my lord, already.
  Ham. Indeed, upon my sword, i
ndeed.

                 Ghost cries under the stage.

  Ghost. Swear.
  Ham. Aha boy, say'st t
hou so? Art thou there, truepenny?
    Come on! You hear this fellow in the cellarage.
    Consent
 to swear.
  Hor. Propose the oath, my lord.
  Ham. Never to speak of this that you have seen.
  
  Swear by my sword.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
  Ham. Hic et ubique? Then we'll shift our ground.

    Come hither, gentlemen,
    And lay your hands again upon my sword.
    Never to speak of thi
s that you have heard:
    Swear by my sword.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear by his sword.
  Ham. Well 
said, old mole! Canst work i' th' earth so fast?
    A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friend
s."
  Hor. O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
  Ham. And therefore as a stranger give 
it welcome.
    There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
    Than are dreamt of in your
 philosophy.
    But come!
    Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
    How strange or odd 
soe'er I bear myself
    (As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
    To put an antic dispositio
n on),
    That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
    With arms encumb'red thus, or this 
head-shake,
    Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
    As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We co
uld, an if we would,'
    Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'
    Or such a
mbiguous giving out, to note
    That you know aught of me- this is not to do,
    So grace and me
rcy at your most need help you,
    Swear.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
                            
                       [They swear.]
  Ham. Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! So, gentlemen,
    With 
all my love I do commend me to you;
    And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
    May do t' express 
his love and friending to you,
    God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;
    And sti
ll your fingers on your lips, I pray.
    The time is out of joint. O cursed spite
    That ever I
 was born to set it right!
    Nay, come, let's go together.
                                     
                    Exeunt.

Act II. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the house of 
Polonius.

Enter Polonius and Reynaldo.

  Pol. Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.

  Rey. I will, my lord.
  Pol. You shall do marvell's wisely, good Reynaldo,
    Before You visit 
him, to make inquire
    Of his behaviour.
  Rey. My lord, I did intend it.
  Pol. Marry, well sa
id, very well said. Look you, sir,
    Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
    And how, a
nd who, what means, and where they keep,
    What company, at what expense; and finding
    By thi
s encompassment and drift of question
    That they do know my son, come you more nearer
    Than 
your particular demands will touch it.
    Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
   
 As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
    And in part him.' Do you mark this, Reynaldo?
  
Rey. Ay, very well, my lord.
  Pol. 'And in part him, but,' you may say, 'not well.
    But if't b
e he I mean, he's very wild
    Addicted so and so'; and there put on him
    What forgeries you p
lease; marry, none so rank
    As may dishonour him- take heed of that;
    But, sir, such wanton,
 wild, and usual slips
    As are companions noted and most known
    To youth and liberty.
  Rey
. As gaming, my lord.
  Pol. Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
    Drabbing. You ma
y go so far.
  Rey. My lord, that would dishonour him.
  Pol. Faith, no, as you may season it in t
he charge.
    You must not put another scandal on him,
    That he is open to incontinency.
    
That's not my meaning. But breathe his faults so quaintly
    That they may seem the taints of libe
rty,
    The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
    A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
    Of ge
neral assault.
  Rey. But, my good lord-
  Pol. Wherefore should you do this?
  Rey. Ay, my lord,

    I would know that.
  Pol. Marry, sir, here's my drift,
    And I believe it is a fetch of wa
rrant.
    You laying these slight sullies on my son
    As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' th' 
working,
    Mark you,
    Your party in converse, him you would sound,
    Having ever seen in t
he prenominate crimes
    The youth you breathe of guilty, be assur'd
    He closes with you in th
is consequence:
    'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman'-
    According to the phrase or
 the addition
    Of man and country-
  Rey. Very good, my lord.
  Pol. And then, sir, does 'a th
is- 'a does- What was I about to
say?
    By the mass, I was about to say something! Where did I l
eave?
  Rey. At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,' and
    gentleman.'
  Pol. At 'cl
oses in the consequence'- Ay, marry!
    He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman.
    I saw him yest
erday, or t'other day,
    Or then, or then, with such or such; and, as you say,
    There was 'a 
gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
    There falling out at tennis'; or perchance,
    'I saw him 
enter such a house of sale,'
    Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
    See you now-
    Your bai
t of falsehood takes this carp of truth;
    And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
    With windl
asses and with assays of bias,
    By indirections find directions out.
    So, by my former lectu
re and advice,
    Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?
  Rey. My lord, I have.
  Pol. Go
d b' wi' ye, fare ye well!
  Rey. Good my lord!                                    [Going.]
  Pol.
 Observe his inclination in yourself.
  Rey. I shall, my lord.
  Pol. And let him ply his music.

  Rey. Well, my lord.
  Pol. Farewell!
                                                  Exit Reyn
aldo.

                       Enter Ophelia.

    How now, Ophelia? What's the matter?
  Oph. O
 my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
  Pol. With what, i' th' name of God?
  Oph. My lord
, as I was sewing in my closet,
    Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac'd,
    No hat upon hi
s head, his stockings foul'd,
    Ungart'red, and down-gyved to his ankle;
    Pale as his shirt, 
his knees knocking each other,
    And with a look so piteous in purport
    As if he had been loo
sed out of hell
    To speak of horrors- he comes before me.
  Pol. Mad for thy love?
  Oph. My l
ord, I do not know,
    But truly I do fear it.
  Pol. What said he?
  Oph. He took me by the wri
st and held me hard;
    Then goes he to the length of all his arm,
    And, with his other hand t
hus o'er his brow,
    He falls to such perusal of my face
    As he would draw it. Long stay'd he
 so.
    At last, a little shaking of mine arm,
    And thrice his head thus waving up and down,

    He rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound
    As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
    And en
d his being. That done, he lets me go,
    And with his head over his shoulder turn'd
    He seem'
d to find his way without his eyes,
    For out o' doors he went without their help
    And to the
 last bended their light on me.
  Pol. Come, go with me. I will go seek the King.
    This is the 
very ecstasy of love,
    Whose violent property fordoes itself
    And leads the will to desperat
e undertakings
    As oft as any passion under heaven
    That does afflict our natures. I am sorr
y.
    What, have you given him any hard words of late?
  Oph. No, my good lord; but, as you did c
ommand,
    I did repel his letters and denied
    His access to me.
  Pol. That hath made him ma
d.
    I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
    I had not quoted him. I fear'd he did but
 trifle
    And meant to wrack thee; but beshrew my jealousy!
    By heaven, it is as proper to ou
r age
    To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
    As it is common for the younger sort
    T
o lack discretion. Come, go we to the King.
    This must be known; which, being kept close, might 
move
    More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
    Come.
                                  
                       Exeunt.

Scene II.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Flourish. [Enter Kin
g and Queen, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern,
cum aliis.

  King. Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guil
denstern.
    Moreover that we much did long to see you,
    The need we have to use you did provo
ke
    Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
    Of Hamlet's transformation. So I call it,

    Sith nor th' exterior nor the inward man
    Resembles that it was. What it should be,
    Mor
e than his father's death, that thus hath put him
    So much from th' understanding of himself,
 
   I cannot dream of. I entreat you both
    That, being of so young days brought up with him,
   
 And since so neighbour'd to his youth and haviour,
    That you vouchsafe your rest here in our co
urt
    Some little time; so by your companies
    To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather
   
 So much as from occasion you may glean,
    Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus
    Tha
t, open'd, lies within our remedy.
  Queen. Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,
    And su
re I am two men there are not living
    To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
    To sho
w us so much gentry and good will
    As to expend your time with us awhile
    For the supply and
 profit of our hope,
    Your visitation shall receive such thanks
    As fits a king's remembranc
e.
  Ros. Both your Majesties
    Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
    Put your drea
d pleasures more into command
    Than to entreaty.
  Guil. But we both obey,
    And here give u
p ourselves, in the full bent,
    To lay our service freely at your feet,
    To be commanded.
 
 King. Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
  Queen. Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosenc
rantz.
    And I beseech you instantly to visit
    My too much changed son.- Go, some of you,
  
  And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
  Guil. Heavens make our presence and our practices
 
   Pleasant and helpful to him!
  Queen. Ay, amen!
                 Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guilden
stern, [with some
                                                    Attendants].

             
            Enter Polonius.

  Pol. Th' ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
    Are joyfully r
eturn'd.
  King. Thou still hast been the father of good news.
  Pol. Have I, my lord? Assure you,
 my good liege,
    I hold my duty as I hold my soul,
    Both to my God and to my gracious king;

    And I do think- or else this brain of mine
    Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
    As i
t hath us'd to do- that I have found
    The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
  King. O, speak of th
at! That do I long to hear.
  Pol. Give first admittance to th' ambassadors.
    My news shall be 
the fruit to that great feast.
  King. Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
              
                                  [Exit Polonius.]
    He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found

    The head and source of all your son's distemper.
  Queen. I doubt it is no other but the main
,
    His father's death and our o'erhasty marriage.
  King. Well, we shall sift him.

         
     Enter Polonius, Voltemand, and Cornelius.

    Welcome, my good friends.
    Say, Voltemand,
 what from our brother Norway?
  Volt. Most fair return of greetings and desires.
    Upon our fir
st, he sent out to suppress
    His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
    To be a preparation
 'gainst the Polack,
    But better look'd into, he truly found
    It was against your Highness; 
whereat griev'd,
    That so his sickness, age, and impotence
    Was falsely borne in hand, sends
 out arrests
    On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys,
    Receives rebuke from Norway, and, i
n fine,
    Makes vow before his uncle never more
    To give th' assay of arms against your Majes
ty.
    Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
    Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee

    And his commission to employ those soldiers,
    So levied as before, against the Polack;
    
With an entreaty, herein further shown,
                                                [Gives a pa
per.]
    That it might please you to give quiet pass
    Through your dominions for this enterpri
se,
    On such regards of safety and allowance
    As therein are set down.
  King. It likes us 
well;
    And at our more consider'd time we'll read,
    Answer, and think upon this business.
 
   Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour.
    Go to your rest; at night we'll feast toget
her.
    Most welcome home!                       Exeunt Ambassadors.
  Pol. This business is well
 ended.
    My liege, and madam, to expostulate
    What majesty should be, what duty is,
    Why
 day is day, night is night, and time is time.
    Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time.

    Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
    And tediousness the limbs and outward flouris
hes,
    I will be brief. Your noble son is mad.
    Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,

    What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
    But let that go.
  Queen. More matter, with less
 art.
  Pol. Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
    That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pit
y;
    And pity 'tis 'tis true. A foolish figure!
    But farewell it, for I will use no art.
   
 Mad let us grant him then. And now remains
    That we find out the cause of this effect-
    Or 
rather say, the cause of this defect,
    For this effect defective comes by cause.
    Thus it re
mains, and the remainder thus.
    Perpend.
    I have a daughter (have while she is mine),
    W
ho in her duty and obedience, mark,
    Hath given me this. Now gather, and surmise.
             
                                [Reads] the letter.
    'To the celestial, and my soul's idol, the 
most beautified
      Ophelia,'-

    That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is a vile

      phrase.
    But you shall hear. Thus:
                                                    
    [Reads.]
    'In her excellent white bosom, these, &c.'
  Queen. Came this from Hamlet to her?

  Pol. Good madam, stay awhile. I will be faithful.     [Reads.]


          'Doubt thou the st
ars are fire;
            Doubt that the sun doth move;
          Doubt truth to be a liar;
     
       But never doubt I love.
      'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers; I have not art
to

    reckon my groans; but that I love thee best, O most best,
believe
    it. Adieu.
      'Thi
ne evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to
him,

HAMLET.'

    This, in obedience, 
hath my daughter shown me;
    And more above, hath his solicitings,
    As they fell out by time,
 by means, and place,
    All given to mine ear.
  King. But how hath she
    Receiv'd his love?

  Pol. What do you think of me?
  King. As of a man faithful and honourable.
  Pol. I would fain 
prove so. But what might you think,
    When I had seen this hot love on the wing
    (As I percei
v'd it, I must tell you that,
    Before my daughter told me), what might you,
    Or my dear Maje
sty your queen here, think,
    If I had play'd the desk or table book,
    Or given my heart a wi
nking, mute and dumb,
    Or look'd upon this love with idle sight?
    What might you think? No, 
I went round to work
    And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
    'Lord Hamlet is a prince, o
ut of thy star.
    This must not be.' And then I prescripts gave her,
    That she should lock he
rself from his resort,
    Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
    Which done, she took the fr
uits of my advice,
    And he, repulsed, a short tale to make,
    Fell into a sadness, then into 
a fast,
    Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
    Thence to a lightness, and, by this dec
lension,
    Into the madness wherein now he raves,
    And all we mourn for.
  King. Do you thin
k 'tis this?
  Queen. it may be, very like.
  Pol. Hath there been such a time- I would fain know 
that-
    That I have Positively said ''Tis so,'
    When it prov'd otherwise.?
  King. Not that 
I know.
  Pol. [points to his head and shoulder] Take this from this, if
this
      be otherwise.

    If circumstances lead me, I will find
    Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
    
Within the centre.
  King. How may we try it further?
  Pol. You know sometimes he walks for hours
 together
    Here in the lobby.
  Queen. So he does indeed.
  Pol. At such a time I'll loose my 
daughter to him.
    Be you and I behind an arras then.
    Mark the encounter. If he love her not
,
    And he not from his reason fall'n thereon
    Let me be no assistant for a state,
    But k
eep a farm and carters.
  King. We will try it.

                 Enter Hamlet, reading on a book
.

  Queen. But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
  Pol. Away, I do beseech you, bo
th away
    I'll board him presently. O, give me leave.
                       Exeunt King and Que
en, [with Attendants].
    How does my good Lord Hamlet?
  Ham. Well, God-a-mercy.
  Pol. Do you 
know me, my lord?
  Ham. Excellent well. You are a fishmonger.
  Pol. Not I, my lord.
  Ham. Then
 I would you were so honest a man.
  Pol. Honest, my lord?
  Ham. Ay, sir. To be honest, as this w
orld goes, is to be one
man
    pick'd out of ten thousand.
  Pol. That's very true, my lord.
  
Ham. For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god
    kissing carrion- Have you a daught
er?
  Pol. I have, my lord.
  Ham. Let her not walk i' th' sun. Conception is a blessing, but
not

    as your daughter may conceive. Friend, look to't.
  Pol. [aside] How say you by that? Still h
arping on my daughter.
Yet
    he knew me not at first. He said I was a fishmonger. He is
far
  
  gone, far gone! And truly in my youth I suff'red much
extremity
    for love- very near this. I'
ll speak to him again.- What do
you
    read, my lord?
  Ham. Words, words, words.
  Pol. What i
s the matter, my lord?
  Ham. Between who?
  Pol. I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
  Ha
m. Slanders, sir; for the satirical rogue says here that old
men
    have grey beards; that their 
faces are wrinkled; their eyes
    purging thick amber and plum-tree gum; and that they have a
   
 plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams. All
which,
    sir, though I most powerfully
 and potently believe, yet I
hold it
    not honesty to have it thus set down; for you yourself, s
ir,
    should be old as I am if, like a crab, you could go backward.

  Pol. [aside] Though this
 be madness, yet there is a method
in't.-
   Will You walk out of the air, my lord?
  Ham. Into m
y grave?
  Pol. Indeed, that is out o' th' air. [Aside] How pregnant
sometimes
    his replies ar
e! a happiness that often madness hits on,
which
    reason and sanity could not so prosperously b
e delivered of.
I
    will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting
between
    him 
and my daughter.- My honourable lord, I will most humbly
take
    my leave of you.
  Ham. You can
not, sir, take from me anything that I will more
    willingly part withal- except my life, except 
my life, except
my
    life,

                    Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Pol. 
Fare you well, my lord.
  Ham. These tedious old fools!
  Pol. You go to seek the Lord Hamlet. The
re he is.
  Ros. [to Polonius] God save you, sir!
                                                
Exit [Polonius].

  Guil. My honour'd lord!
  Ros. My most dear lord!
  Ham. My excellent good f
riends! How dost thou, Guildenstern?
Ah,
    Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
  Ros. As th
e indifferent children of the earth.
  Guil. Happy in that we are not over-happy.
    On Fortune's
 cap we are not the very button.
  Ham. Nor the soles of her shoe?
  Ros. Neither, my lord.
  Ham
. Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her
    favours?
  Guil. Faith, her privates 
we.
  Ham. In the secret parts of Fortune? O! most true! she is a
    strumpet. What news ?
  Ros
. None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
  Ham. Then is doomsday near! But your news is 
not true. Let me
    question more in particular. What have you, my good friends,
    deserved at 
the hands of Fortune that she sends you to prison
    hither?
  Guil. Prison, my lord?
  Ham. Den
mark's a prison.
  Ros. Then is the world one.
  Ham. A goodly one; in which there are many confin
es, wards, and
    dungeons, Denmark being one o' th' worst.
  Ros. We think not so, my lord.
  H
am. Why, then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either
good
    or bad but thinking makes it 
so. To me it is a prison.
  Ros. Why, then your ambition makes it one. 'Tis too narrow for
your
 
   mind.
  Ham. O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a
    king of infinite sp
ace, were it not that I have bad dreams.
  Guil. Which dreams indeed are ambition; for the very sub
stance
of
    the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
  Ham. A dream itself is but a shado
w.
  Ros. Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality
that
    it is but a shadow's
 shadow.
  Ham. Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and
outstretch'd
    heroes the beg
gars' shadows. Shall we to th' court? for, by
my
    fay, I cannot reason.
  Both. We'll wait upo
n you.
  Ham. No such matter! I will not sort you with the rest of my
    servants; for, to speak 
to you like an honest man, I am most
    dreadfully attended. But in the beaten way of friendship,

what
    make you at Elsinore?
  Ros. To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
  Ham. Beggar th
at I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank
you;
    and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too 
dear a halfpenny.
Were
    you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free
    visitatio
n? Come, deal justly with me. Come, come! Nay,
speak.
  Guil. What should we say, my lord?
  Ham.
 Why, anything- but to th' purpose. You were sent for; and
    there is a kind of confession in you
r looks, which your
modesties
    have not craft enough to colour. I know the good King and
Queen

    have sent for you.
  Ros. To what end, my lord?
  Ham. That you must teach me. But let me co
njure you by the
rights
    of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the
    obligat
ion of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear
a
    better proposer could charge you witha
l, be even and direct
with
    me, whether you were sent for or no.
  Ros. [aside to Guildenstern
] What say you?
  Ham. [aside] Nay then, I have an eye of you.- If you love me,
hold
    not off.

  Guil. My lord, we were sent for.
  Ham. I will tell you why. So shall my anticipation prevent y
our
    discovery, and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no
    feather. I have of late- bu
t wherefore I know not- lost all
my
    mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it goe
s
so
    heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the
earth,
    seems to me a steril
e promontory; this most excellent canopy,
the
    air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament,
 this
majestical
    roof fretted with golden fire- why, it appeareth no other
thing
    to me t
han a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What
a
    piece of work is a man! how noble in 
reason! how infinite in
    faculties! in form and moving how express and admirable! in
    action
 how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the
    beauty of the world, the paragon of ani
mals! And yet to me
what
    is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me- no, nor
woman
  
  neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.
  Ros. My lord, there was no such stuff in my
 thoughts.
  Ham. Why did you laugh then, when I said 'Man delights not me'?
  Ros. To think, my l
ord, if you delight not in man, what lenten
    entertainment the players shall receive from you. W
e coted
them
    on the way, and hither are they coming to offer you service.
  Ham. He that play
s the king shall be welcome- his Majesty shall
    have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall
 use his foil
and
    target; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humorous man
shall
    end hi
s part in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose
    lungs are tickle o' th' sere; and the l
ady shall say her mind
    freely, or the blank verse shall halt for't. What players are
    they?

  Ros. Even those you were wont to take such delight in, the
    tragedians of the city.
  Ham. 
How chances it they travel? Their residence, both in
    reputation and profit, was better both way
s.
  Ros. I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late
    innovation.
  Ham. Do they 
hold the same estimation they did when I was in
the
    city? Are they so follow'd?
  Ros. No ind
eed are they not.
  Ham. How comes it? Do they grow rusty?
  Ros. Nay, their endeavour keeps in th
e wonted pace; but there
is,
    sir, an eyrie of children, little eyases, that cry out on the
to
p
    of question and are most tyrannically clapp'd for't. These
are now
    the fashion, and so 
berattle the common stages (so they call
    them) that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goosequi
lls and
    dare scarce come thither.
  Ham. What, are they children? Who maintains 'em? How are t
hey
    escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can
    sing? Will they not say 
afterwards, if they should grow
    themselves to common players (as it is most like, if their
mea
ns
    are no better), their writers do them wrong to make them
exclaim
    against their own suc
cession.
  Ros. Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the
nation
    holds it no si
n to tarre them to controversy. There was, for
a
    while, no money bid for argument unless the p
oet and the
player
    went to cuffs in the question.
  Ham. Is't possible?
  Guil. O, there has
 been much throwing about of brains.
  Ham. Do the boys carry it away?
  Ros. Ay, that they do, my
 lord- Hercules and his load too.
  Ham. It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark,

and
    those that would make mows at him while my father lived give
    twenty, forty, fifty, a h
undred ducats apiece for his picture
in
    little. 'Sblood, there is something in this more than

natural, if
    philosophy could find it out.

                     Flourish for the Players.


  Guil. There are the players.
  Ham. Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come!
T
h'
    appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me
comply
    with you in this garb, 
lest my extent to the players (which I
    tell you must show fairly outwards) should more appear l
ike
    entertainment than yours. You are welcome. But my
uncle-father
    and aunt-mother are de
ceiv'd.
  Guil. In what, my dear lord?
  Ham. I am but mad north-north-west. When the wind is sout
herly
I
    know a hawk from a handsaw.

                            Enter Polonius.

  Pol. W
ell be with you, gentlemen!
  Ham. Hark you, Guildenstern- and you too- at each ear a hearer!
    
That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling
    clouts.
  Ros. Happily he's the 
second time come to them; for they say an
old
    man is twice a child.
  Ham. I will prophesy he
 comes to tell me of the players. Mark
it.-
   You say right, sir; a Monday morning; twas so indee
d.
  Pol. My lord, I have news to tell you.
  Ham. My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius 
was an
actor in
    Rome-
  Pol. The actors are come hither, my lord.
  Ham. Buzz, buzz!
  Pol.
 Upon my honour-
  Ham. Then came each actor on his ass-
  Pol. The best actors in the world, eith
er for tragedy, comedy,
    history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral,
    tragical
-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral;
scene
    individable, or poem unlimited. Senec
a cannot be too heavy,
nor
    Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these
are

    the only men.
  Ham. O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
  Pol. What tre
asure had he, my lord?
  Ham. Why,

         'One fair daughter, and no more,
           The whi
ch he loved passing well.'

  Pol. [aside] Still on my daughter.
  Ham. Am I not i' th' right, ol
d Jephthah?
  Pol. If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I
    love passing wel
l.
  Ham. Nay, that follows not.
  Pol. What follows then, my lord?
  Ham. Why,

           'As
 by lot, God wot,'

 and then, you know,

           'It came to pass, as most like it was.'


    The first row of the pious chanson will show you more; for
look
    where my abridgment comes.


                     Enter four or five Players.

    You are welcome, masters; welcome, all.-
 I am glad to see
thee
    well.- Welcome, good friends.- O, my old friend? Why, thy
face is
   
 valanc'd since I saw thee last. Com'st' thou to' beard me in
    Denmark?- What, my young lady and
 mistress? By'r Lady, your
    ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last by the
    al
titude of a chopine. Pray God your voice, like a piece of
    uncurrent gold, be not crack'd within
 the ring.- Masters, you
are
    all welcome. We'll e'en to't like French falconers, fly at
    a
nything we see. We'll have a speech straight. Come, give us
a
    taste of your quality. Come, a p
assionate speech.
  1. Play. What speech, my good lord?
  Ham. I heard thee speak me a speech once
, but it was never
acted;
    or if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember,
pleas'd
  
  not the million, 'twas caviary to the general; but it was (as
I
    receiv'd it, and others, who
se judgments in such matters
cried in
    the top of mine) an excellent play, well digested in the

scenes,
    set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember one said
    there were no sall
ets in the lines to make the matter
savoury,
    nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the
 author of
    affectation; but call'd it an honest method, as wholesome as
    sweet, and by very
 much more handsome than fine. One speech
in't
    I chiefly lov'd. 'Twas AEneas' tale to Dido, an
d thereabout
of it
    especially where he speaks of Priam's slaughter. If it live
in
    your m
emory, begin at this line- let me see, let me see:

         'The rugged Pyrrhus, like th' Hyrcani
an beast-'

    'Tis not so; it begins with Pyrrhus:

         'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sab
le arms,
         Black as his purpose, did the night resemble
         When he lay couched in the
 ominous horse,
         Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd
         With heraldry m
ore dismal. Head to foot
         Now is be total gules, horridly trick'd
         With blood of f
athers, mothers, daughters, sons,
         Bak'd and impasted with the parching streets,
         
That lend a tyrannous and a damned light
         To their lord's murther. Roasted in wrath and fir
e,
         And thus o'ersized with coagulate gore,
         With eyes like carbuncles, the hellis
h Pyrrhus
         Old grandsire Priam seeks.'

    So, proceed you.
  Pol. Fore God, my lord, w
ell spoken, with good accent and good
     discretion.

  1. Play. 'Anon he finds him,
      Str
iking too short at Greeks. His antique sword,
      Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
  
    Repugnant to command. Unequal match'd,
      Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide;
  
    But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
      Th' unnerved father falls. Then senseless I
lium,
      Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
      Stoops to his base, and with a hideo
us crash
      Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear. For lo! his sword,
      Which was declining on the mi
lky head
      Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' th' air to stick.
      So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrh
us stood,
      And, like a neutral to his will and matter,
      Did nothing.
      But, as we o
ften see, against some storm,
      A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
      The bold
 winds speechless, and the orb below
      As hush as death- anon the dreadful thunder
      Doth 
rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
      Aroused vengeance sets him new awork;
      And n
ever did the Cyclops' hammers fall
      On Mars's armour, forg'd for proof eterne,
      With les
s remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
      Now falls on Priam.
      Out, out, thou strumpet For
tune! All you gods,
      In general synod take away her power;
      Break all the spokes and fel
lies from her wheel,
      And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
      As low as to the
 fiends!

  Pol. This is too long.
  Ham. It shall to the barber's, with your beard.- Prithee say

on.
    He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps. Say on;
come to
    Hecuba.

  1. P
lay. 'But who, O who, had seen the mobled queen-'

  Ham. 'The mobled queen'?
  Pol. That's good!
 'Mobled queen' is good.

  1. Play. 'Run barefoot up and down, threat'ning the flames
      With
 bisson rheum; a clout upon that head
      Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
      Abo
ut her lank and all o'erteemed loins,
      A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up-
      Who t
his had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd
      'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have pronoun
c'd.
      But if the gods themselves did see her then,
      When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious 
sport
      In Mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,
      The instant burst of clamour that
 she made
      (Unless things mortal move them not at all)
      Would have made milch the burnin
g eyes of heaven
      And passion in the gods.'

  Pol. Look, whe'r he has not turn'd his colour
, and has tears
in's
    eyes. Prithee no more!
  Ham. 'Tis well. I'll have thee speak out the re
st of this
soon.-
    Good my lord, will you see the players well bestow'd? Do you
    hear? Let 
them be well us'd; for they are the abstract and
brief
    chronicles of the time. After your deat
h you were better have
a
    bad epitaph than their ill report while you live.
  Pol. My lord, I 
will use them according to their desert.
  Ham. God's bodykins, man, much better! Use every man aft
er his
    desert, and who should scape whipping? Use them after your
own
    honour and dignity.
 The less they deserve, the more merit is
in
    your bounty. Take them in.
  Pol. Come, sirs.
 
 Ham. Follow him, friends. We'll hear a play to-morrow.
                 Exeunt Polonius and Player
s [except the First].
    Dost thou hear me, old friend? Can you play 'The Murther of
    Gonzago'
?
  1. Play. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need, study a
    s
peech of some dozen or sixteen lines which I would set down
and
    insert in't, could you not?
 
 1. Play. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Very well. Follow that lord- and look you mock him not.
            
                                [Exit First Player.]
    My good friends, I'll leave you till night
. You are welcome
to
    Elsinore.
  Ros. Good my lord!
  Ham. Ay, so, God b' wi' ye!
         
                   [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
    Now I am alone.
    O what a rogue and
 peasant slave am I!
    Is it not monstrous that this player here,
    But in a fiction, in a dre
am of passion,
    Could force his soul so to his own conceit
    That, from her working, all his 
visage wann'd,
    Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
    A broken voice, and his whole f
unction suiting
    With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!
    For Hecuba!
    What's He
cuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
    That he should weep for her? What would he do,
    Had he the mo
tive and the cue for passion
    That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
    And cleave t
he general ear with horrid speech;
    Make mad the guilty and appal the free,
    Confound the ig
norant, and amaze indeed
    The very faculties of eyes and ears.
    Yet I,
    A dull and muddy
-mettled rascal, peak
    Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
    And can say nothing! No,
 not for a king,
    Upon whose property and most dear life
    A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a c
oward?
    Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
    Plucks off my beard and blows it in my
 face?
    Tweaks me by th' nose? gives me the lie i' th' throat
    As deep as to the lungs? Who 
does me this, ha?
    'Swounds, I should take it! for it cannot be
    But I am pigeon-liver'd and
 lack gall
    To make oppression bitter, or ere this
    I should have fatted all the region kite
s
    With this slave's offal. Bloody bawdy villain!
    Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kind
less villain!
    O, vengeance!
    Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
    That I, the so
n of a dear father murther'd,
    Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
    Must (like a whor
e) unpack my heart with words
    And fall a-cursing like a very drab,
    A scullion!
    Fie up
on't! foh! About, my brain! Hum, I have heard
    That guilty creatures, sitting at a play,
    Ha
ve by the very cunning of the scene
    Been struck so to the soul that presently
    They have pr
oclaim'd their malefactions;
    For murther, though it have no tongue, will speak
    With most m
iraculous organ, I'll have these Players
    Play something like the murther of my father
    Befo
re mine uncle. I'll observe his looks;
    I'll tent him to the quick. If he but blench,
    I kno
w my course. The spirit that I have seen
    May be a devil; and the devil hath power
    T' assum
e a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
    Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
    As he is very p
otent with such spirits,
    Abuses me to damn me. I'll have grounds
    More relative than this. 
The play's the thing
    Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King.         Exit.

ACT III. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, 
Rosencrantz, Guildenstern,
and Lords.

  King. And can you by no drift of circumstance
    Get f
rom him why he puts on this confusion,
    Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
    With turbu
lent and dangerous lunacy?
  Ros. He does confess he feels himself distracted,
    But from what c
ause he will by no means speak.
  Guil. Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
    But with a c
rafty madness keeps aloof
    When we would bring him on to some confession
    Of his true state.

  Queen. Did he receive you well?
  Ros. Most like a gentleman.
  Guil. But with much forcing of
 his disposition.
  Ros. Niggard of question, but of our demands
    Most free in his reply.
  Qu
een. Did you assay him
    To any pastime?
  Ros. Madam, it so fell out that certain players
    
We o'erraught on the way. Of these we told him,
    And there did seem in him a kind of joy
    To
 hear of it. They are here about the court,
    And, as I think, they have already order
    This 
night to play before him.
  Pol. 'Tis most true;
    And he beseech'd me to entreat your Majesties

    To hear and see the matter.
  King. With all my heart, and it doth much content me
    To he
ar him so inclin'd.
    Good gentlemen, give him a further edge
    And drive his purpose on to th
ese delights.
  Ros. We shall, my lord.
                            Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guilden
stern.
  King. Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
    For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
    
That he, as 'twere by accident, may here
    Affront Ophelia.
    Her father and myself (lawful es
pials)
    Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing unseen,
    We may of their encounter frankly jud
ge
    And gather by him, as he is behav'd,
    If't be th' affliction of his love, or no,

at thus he suffers for.
  Queen. I shall obey you;
    And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
    
That your good beauties be the happy cause
    Of Hamlet's wildness. So shall I hope your virtues

    Will bring him to his wonted way again,
    To both your honours.
  Oph. Madam, I wish it may.

                                                   [Exit Queen.]
  Pol. Ophelia, walk you here.- 
Gracious, so please you,
    We will bestow ourselves.- [To Ophelia] Read on this book,
    That s
how of such an exercise may colour
    Your loneliness.- We are oft to blame in this,
    'Tis too
 much prov'd, that with devotion's visage
    And pious action we do sugar o'er
    The Devil hims
elf.
  King. [aside] O, 'tis too true!
    How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!

    The harlot's cheek, beautied with plast'ring art,
    Is not more ugly to the thing that helps 
it
    Than is my deed to my most painted word.
    O heavy burthen!
  Pol. I hear him coming. Le
t's withdraw, my lord.
                                      Exeunt King and Polonius].

        
                   Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. To be, or not to be- that is the question:
    Whether '
tis nobler in the mind to suffer
    The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
    Or to take ar
ms against a sea of troubles,
    And by opposing end them. To die- to sleep-
    No more; and by 
a sleep to say we end
    The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks
    That flesh is heir to
. 'Tis a consummation
    Devoutly to be wish'd. To die- to sleep.
    To sleep- perchance to drea
m: ay, there's the rub!
    For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
    When we have shuff
led off this mortal coil,
    Must give us pause. There's the respect
    That makes calamity of s
o long life.
    For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
    Th' oppressor's wrong, the p
roud man's contumely,
    The pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay,
    The insolence of office
, and the spurns
    That patient merit of th' unworthy takes,
    When he himself might his quiet
us make
    With a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear,
    To grunt and sweat under a weary
 life,
    But that the dread of something after death-
    The undiscover'd country, from whose b
ourn
    No traveller returns- puzzles the will,
    And makes us rather bear those ills we have

    Than fly to others that we know not of?
    Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
    A
nd thus the native hue of resolution
    Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
    And e
nterprises of great pith and moment
    With this regard their currents turn awry
    And lose the
 name of action.- Soft you now!
    The fair Ophelia!- Nymph, in thy orisons
    Be all my sins re
memb'red.
  Oph. Good my lord,
    How does your honour for this many a day?
  Ham. I humbly than
k you; well, well, well.
  Oph. My lord, I have remembrances of yours
    That I have longed long 
to re-deliver.
    I pray you, now receive them.
  Ham. No, not I!
    I never gave you aught.
 
 Oph. My honour'd lord, you know right well you did,
    And with them words of so sweet breath com
pos'd
    As made the things more rich. Their perfume lost,
    Take these again; for to the noble
 mind
    Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
    There, my lord.
  Ham. Ha, ha! Are yo
u honest?
  Oph. My lord?
  Ham. Are you fair?
  Oph. What means your lordship?
  Ham. That if y
ou be honest and fair, your honesty should admit
no
    discourse to your beauty.
  Oph. Could be
auty, my lord, have better commerce than with
honesty?
  Ham. Ay, truly; for the power of beauty w
ill sooner transform
    honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty
can
    tran
slate beauty into his likeness. This was sometime a
paradox,
    but now the time gives it proof. 
I did love you once.
  Oph. Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
  Ham. You should not have be
liev'd me; for virtue cannot so
    inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it. I loved
you

    not.
  Oph. I was the more deceived.
  Ham. Get thee to a nunnery! Why wouldst thou be a bre
eder of
    sinners? I am myself indifferent honest, but yet I could
accuse
    me of such things
 that it were better my mother had not borne
me.
    I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with 
more offences at
my
    beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give
    them sh
ape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows
as I
    do, crawling between earth and heav
en? We are arrant knaves
all;
    believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where's your
    
father?
  Oph. At home, my lord.
  Ham. Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool

    nowhere but in's own house. Farewell.
  Oph. O, help him, you sweet heavens!
  Ham. If thou d
ost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy
dowry:
    be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow
, thou shalt not
escape
    calumny. Get thee to a nunnery. Go, farewell. Or if thou wilt
    nee
ds marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what
    monsters you make of them. To a nunn
ery, go; and quickly too.
    Farewell.
  Oph. O heavenly powers, restore him!
  Ham. I have hear
d of your paintings too, well enough. God hath
    given you one face, and you make yourselves anot
her. You jig,
you
    amble, and you lisp; you nickname God's creatures and make
your
    wanton
ness your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't! it hath
made
    me mad. I say, we will have no mor
e marriages. Those that are
    married already- all but one- shall live; the rest shall keep
as

    they are. To a nunnery, go.                            Exit.
  Oph. O, what a noble mind is her
e o'erthrown!
    The courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword,
    Th' expectancy and
 rose of the fair state,
    The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
    Th' observ'd of all o
bservers- quite, quite down!
    And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
    That suck'd the ho
ney of his music vows,
    Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
    Like sweet bells jang
led, out of tune and harsh;
    That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
    Blasted with ec
stasy. O, woe is me
    T' have seen what I have seen, see what I see!

                   Enter 
King and Polonius.

  King. Love? his affections do not that way tend;
    Nor what he spake, tho
ugh it lack'd form a little,
    Was not like madness. There's something in his soul
    O'er whic
h his melancholy sits on brood;
    And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
    Will be some dan
ger; which for to prevent,
    I have in quick determination
    Thus set it down: he shall with s
peed to England
    For the demand of our neglected tribute.
    Haply the seas, and countries dif
ferent,
    With variable objects, shall expel
    This something-settled matter in his heart,
  
  Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
    From fashion of himself. What think you on't?

  Pol. It shall do well. But yet do I believe
    The origin and commencement of his grief
    Sp
rung from neglected love.- How now, Ophelia?
    You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said.
    W
e heard it all.- My lord, do as you please;
    But if you hold it fit, after the play
    Let his
 queen mother all alone entreat him
    To show his grief. Let her be round with him;
    And I'll
 be plac'd so please you, in the ear
    Of all their conference. If she find him not,
    To Engl
and send him; or confine him where
    Your wisdom best shall think.
  King. It shall be so.
    
Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.         Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. hall in t
he Castle.

Enter Hamlet and three of the Players.

  Ham. Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pr
onounc'd it to you,
    trippingly on the tongue. But if you mouth it, as many of our
    players 
do, I had as live the town crier spoke my lines. Nor
do
    not saw the air too much with your han
d, thus, but use all
    gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and (as I may say)
    whirlwin
d of your passion, you must acquire and beget a
    temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it o
ffends me to
the
    soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion
to
    tatter
s, to very rags, to split the cars of the groundlings,
who
    (for the most part) are capable of 
nothing but inexplicable
dumb
    shows and noise. I would have such a fellow whipp'd for
o'erdoi
ng
    Termagant. It out-herods Herod. Pray you avoid it.
  Player. I warrant your honour.
  Ham.
 Be not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be
your
    tutor. Suit the action to the wo
rd, the word to the action;
with
    this special observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of

    nature: for anything so overdone is from the purpose of
playing,
    whose end, both at the 
first and now, was and is, to hold, as
    'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show Virtue her own

feature,
    scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time
his
    form and pressur
e. Now this overdone, or come tardy off,
though
    it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make t
he judicious
    grieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance
    o'erweigh a whole
 theatre of others. O, there be players that
I
    have seen play, and heard others praise, and th
at highly (not
to
    speak it profanely), that, neither having the accent of
    Christians, nor
 the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have
so
    strutted and bellowed that I have thought some
 of Nature's
    journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they
imitated
    humanity so a
bominably.
  Player. I hope we have reform'd that indifferently with us,
sir.
  Ham. O, reform it
 altogether! And let those that play your
clowns
    speak no more than is set down for them. For 
there be of them
    that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren
    spectators 
to laugh too, though in the mean time some
necessary
    question of the play be then to be consid
ered. That's
villanous
    and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it.
Go
    ma
ke you ready.
                                                 Exeunt Players.

            Enter
 Polonius, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.

    How now, my lord? Will the King hear this piece of 
work?
  Pol. And the Queen too, and that presently.
  Ham. Bid the players make haste, [Exit Polon
ius.] Will you two
    help to hasten them?
  Both. We will, my lord.                       Exeunt
 they two.
  Ham. What, ho, Horatio!

                      Enter Horatio.

  Hor. Here, sweet 
lord, at your service.
  Ham. Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
    As e'er my conversation cop
'd withal.
  Hor. O, my dear lord!
  Ham. Nay, do not think I flatter;
    For what advancement m
ay I hope from thee,
    That no revenue hast but thy good spirits
    To feed and clothe thee? Wh
y should the poor be flatter'd?
    No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
    And crook the
 pregnant hinges of the knee
    Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
    Since my dea
r soul was mistress of her choice
    And could of men distinguish, her election
    Hath seal'd t
hee for herself. For thou hast been
    As one, in suff'ring all, that suffers nothing;
    A man 
that Fortune's buffets and rewards
    Hast ta'en with equal thanks; and blest are those
    Whose
 blood and judgment are so well commingled
    That they are not a pipe for Fortune's finger
    T
o sound what stop she please. Give me that man
    That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him

    In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
    As I do thee. Something too much of this I

    There is a play to-night before the King.
    One scene of it comes near the circumstance,
  
  Which I have told thee, of my father's death.
    I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
   
 Even with the very comment of thy soul
    Observe my uncle. If his occulted guilt
    Do not its
elf unkennel in one speech,
    It is a damned ghost that we have seen,
    And my imaginations ar
e as foul
    As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
    For I mine eyes will rivet to his fac
e,
    And after we will both our judgments join
    In censure of his seeming.
  Hor. Well, my l
ord.
    If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
    And scape detecting, I will pay th
e theft.

    Sound a flourish. [Enter Trumpets and Kettledrums. Danish
    march. [Enter King, Q
ueen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz,
      Guildenstern, and other Lords attendant, with the Guard

                       carrying torches.

  Ham. They are coming to the play. I must be idle.
 
   Get you a place.
  King. How fares our cousin Hamlet?
  Ham. Excellent, i' faith; of the chamel
eon's dish. I eat the
air,
    promise-cramm'd. You cannot feed capons so.
  King. I have nothing
 with this answer, Hamlet. These words are
not
    mine.
  Ham. No, nor mine now. [To Polonius] M
y lord, you play'd once
    i' th' university, you say?
  Pol. That did I, my lord, and was accoun
ted a good actor.
  Ham. What did you enact?
  Pol. I did enact Julius Caesar; I was kill'd i' th'
 Capitol;
Brutus
    kill'd me.
  Ham. It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf
ther
e. Be
    the players ready.
  Ros. Ay, my lord. They stay upon your patience.
  Queen. Come hith
er, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
  Ham. No, good mother. Here's metal more attractive.
  Pol. [to th
e King] O, ho! do you mark that?
  Ham. Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
                           
       [Sits down at Ophelia's feet.]

  Oph. No, my lord.
  Ham. I mean, my head upon your lap?

  Oph. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Do you think I meant country matters?
  Oph. I think nothing, my lord.

  Ham. That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
  Oph. What is, my lord?
  Ham. Nothing
.
  Oph. You are merry, my lord.
  Ham. Who, I?
  Oph. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. O God, your only jig-
maker! What should a man do but be
merry?
    For look you how cheerfully my mother looks, and my 
father
died
    within 's two hours.
  Oph. Nay 'tis twice two months, my lord.
  Ham. So long? 
Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I'll have
a
    suit of sables. O heavens! die two months 
ago, and not
forgotten
    yet? Then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his
life
    
half a year. But, by'r Lady, he must build churches then; or
else
    shall he suffer not thinking
 on, with the hobby-horse, whose

    epitaph is 'For O, for O, the hobby-horse is forgot!'

   
            Hautboys play. The dumb show enters.

    Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the 
Queen embracing
    him and he her. She kneels, and makes show of protestation
    unto him. He ta
kes her up, and declines his head upon her
    neck. He lays him down upon a bank of flowers. She, 
seeing
    him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his
    crown, kisses it, pou
rs poison in the sleeper's ears, and
    leaves him. The Queen returns, finds the King dead, and ma
kes
    passionate action. The Poisoner with some three or four
Mutes,
    comes in again, seem t
o condole with her. The dead body is
    carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with gifts; she

    seems harsh and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts
    his love.
                     
                                    Exeunt.

  Oph. What means this, my lord?
  Ham. Marry, this 
is miching malhecho; it means mischief.
  Oph. Belike this show imports the argument of the play.


                      Enter Prologue.

  Ham. We shall know by this fellow. The players cannot k
eep
counsel;
    they'll tell all.
  Oph. Will he tell us what this show meant?
  Ham. Ay, or an
y show that you'll show him. Be not you asham'd
to
    show, he'll not shame to tell you what it m
eans.
  Oph. You are naught, you are naught! I'll mark the play.

    Pro. For us, and for our tr
agedy,
      Here stooping to your clemency,
      We beg your hearing patiently.                 
    [Exit.]

  Ham. Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
  Oph. 'Tis brief, my lord.
  Ham
. As woman's love.

              Enter [two Players as] King and Queen.

    King. Full thirty 
times hath Phoebus' cart gone round
      Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
      And 
thirty dozen moons with borrowed sheen
      About the world have times twelve thirties been,
    
  Since love our hearts, and Hymen did our hands,
      Unite comutual in most sacred bands.
    Q
ueen. So many journeys may the sun and moon
      Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
     
 But woe is me! you are so sick of late,
      So far from cheer and from your former state.
     
 That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
      Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must;
    
  For women's fear and love holds quantity,
      In neither aught, or in extremity.
      Now wha
t my love is, proof hath made you know;
      And as my love is siz'd, my fear is so.
      Where 
love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
      Where little fears grow great, great love grows 
there.
    King. Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;
      My operant powers their fu
nctions leave to do.
      And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
      Honour'd, belov'd,
 and haply one as kind
      For husband shalt thou-
    Queen. O, confound the rest!
      Such 
love must needs be treason in my breast.
      When second husband let me be accurst!
      None w
ed the second but who killed the first.

  Ham. [aside] Wormwood, wormwood!

    Queen. The inst
ances that second marriage move
      Are base respects of thrift, but none of love.
      A secon
d time I kill my husband dead
      When second husband kisses me in bed.
    King. I do believe y
ou think what now you speak;
      But what we do determine oft we break.
      Purpose is but the
 slave to memory,
      Of violent birth, but poor validity;
      Which now, like fruit unripe, s
ticks on the tree,
      But fall unshaken when they mellow be.
      Most necessary 'tis that we 
forget
      To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt.
      What to ourselves in passion we pro
pose,
      The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
      The violence of either grief or joy

      Their own enactures with themselves destroy.
      Where joy most revels, grief doth most lam
ent;
      Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
      This world is not for aye, nor 'tis
 not strange
      That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
      For 'tis a question 
left us yet to prove,
      Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
      The great man d
own, you mark his favourite flies,
      The poor advanc'd makes friends of enemies;
      And hit
herto doth love on fortune tend,
      For who not needs shall never lack a friend,
      And who 
in want a hollow friend doth try,
      Directly seasons him his enemy.
      But, orderly to end 
where I begun,
      Our wills and fates do so contrary run
      That our devices still are overt
hrown;
      Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own.
      So think thou wilt no second
 husband wed;
      But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
    Queen. Nor earth to me g
ive food, nor heaven light,
      Sport and repose lock from me day and night,
      To desperatio
n turn my trust and hope,
      An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope,
      Each opposite that 
blanks the face of joy
      Meet what I would have well, and it destroy,
      Both here and henc
e pursue me lasting strife,
      If, once a widow, ever I be wife!

  Ham. If she should break i
t now!

    King. 'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile.
      My spirits grow dull, and
 fain I would beguile
      The tedious day with sleep.
    Queen. Sleep rock thy brain,
        
                                            [He] sleeps.
      And never come mischance between us 
twain!
Exit.

  Ham. Madam, how like you this play?
  Queen. The lady doth protest too much, met
hinks.
  Ham. O, but she'll keep her word.
  King. Have you heard the argument? Is there no offenc
e in't?
  Ham. No, no! They do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i'
th'
    world.
  King. Wh
at do you call the play?
  Ham. 'The Mousetrap.' Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the
    imag
e of a murther done in Vienna. Gonzago is the duke's
name;
    his wife, Baptista. You shall see a
non. 'Tis a knavish piece
of
    work; but what o' that? Your Majesty, and we that have free
    
souls, it touches us not. Let the gall'd jade winch; our
withers
    are unwrung.

             
            Enter Lucianus.

    This is one Lucianus, nephew to the King.
  Oph. You are as good
 as a chorus, my lord.
  Ham. I could interpret between you and your love, if I could
see
    the
 puppets dallying.
  Oph. You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
  Ham. It would cost you a groaning
 to take off my edge.
  Oph. Still better, and worse.
  Ham. So you must take your husbands.- Begi
n, murtherer. Pox,
leave
    thy damnable faces, and begin! Come, the croaking raven doth
    bel
low for revenge.

    Luc. Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
      Confede
rate season, else no creature seeing;
      Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,
      
With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,
      Thy natural magic and dire property
     
 On wholesome life usurp immediately.
                                   Pours the poison in his ea
rs.

  Ham. He poisons him i' th' garden for's estate. His name's
Gonzago.
    The story is exta
nt, and written in very choice Italian. You
    shall see anon how the murtherer gets the love of G
onzago's
wife.
  Oph. The King rises.
  Ham. What, frighted with false fire?
  Queen. How fares 
my lord?
  Pol. Give o'er the play.
  King. Give me some light! Away!
  All. Lights, lights, ligh
ts!
                              Exeunt all but Hamlet and Horatio.
  Ham.   Why, let the strucke
n deer go weep,
          The hart ungalled play;
         For some must watch, while some must sl
eep:
          Thus runs the world away.
    Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers- if the
 rest of
my
    fortunes turn Turk with me-with two Provincial roses on my
raz'd
    shoes, get 
me a fellowship in a cry of players, sir?
  Hor. Half a share.
  Ham.   A whole one I!
         F
or thou dost know, O Damon dear,
           This realm dismantled was
         Of Jove himself; an
d now reigns here
           A very, very- pajock.
  Hor. You might have rhym'd.
  Ham. O good Ho
ratio, I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand
    pound! Didst perceive?
  Hor. Very well, my l
ord.
  Ham. Upon the talk of the poisoning?
  Hor. I did very well note him.
  Ham.   Aha! Come, 
some music! Come, the recorders!
         For if the King like not the comedy,
         Why then, 
belike he likes it not, perdy.
    Come, some music!

                Enter Rosencrantz and Guild
enstern.

  Guil. Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.
  Ham. Sir, a whole history.
  Gui
l. The King, sir-
  Ham. Ay, sir, what of him?
  Guil. Is in his retirement, marvellous distemper'
d.
  Ham. With drink, sir?
  Guil. No, my lord; rather with choler.
  Ham. Your wisdom should sho
w itself more richer to signify this
to
    the doctor; for me to put him to his purgation would p
erhaps
    plunge him into far more choler.
  Guil. Good my lord, put your discourse into some fra
me, and
start
    not so wildly from my affair.
  Ham. I am tame, sir; pronounce.
  Guil. The Qu
een, your mother, in most great affliction of
spirit
    hath sent me to you.
  Ham. You are welc
ome.
  Guil. Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right
breed.
    If it shall please y
ou to make me a wholesome answer, I will
do
    your mother's commandment; if not, your pardon and
 my return
    shall be the end of my business.
  Ham. Sir, I cannot.
  Guil. What, my lord?
  H
am. Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseas'd. But, sir,
such
    answer as I can make, you s
hall command; or rather, as you
say,
    my mother. Therefore no more, but to the matter! My mothe
r,
you
    say-
  Ros. Then thus she says: your behaviour hath struck her into
    amazement and
 admiration.
  Ham. O wonderful son, that can so stonish a mother! But is
there no
    sequel at 
the heels of this mother's admiration? Impart.
  Ros. She desires to speak with you in her closet e
re you go to
bed.
  Ham. We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any
    further t
rade with us?
  Ros. My lord, you once did love me.
  Ham. And do still, by these pickers and stea
lers!
  Ros. Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? You do
surely
    bar the door upon y
our own liberty, if you deny your griefs
to
    your friend.
  Ham. Sir, I lack advancement.
  R
os. How can that be, when you have the voice of the King
himself
    for your succession in Denmar
k?
  Ham. Ay, sir, but 'while the grass grows'- the proverb is
something
    musty.

          
           Enter the Players with recorders.

    O, the recorders! Let me see one. To withdraw wi
th you- why
do
    you go about to recover the wind of me, as if you would drive
me
    into a t
oil?
  Guil. O my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too
unmannerly.
  Ham. I do not well u
nderstand that. Will you play upon this
pipe?
  Guil. My lord, I cannot.
  Ham. I pray you.
  Gu
il. Believe me, I cannot.
  Ham. I do beseech you.
  Guil. I know, no touch of it, my lord.
  Ham
. It is as easy as lying. Govern these ventages with your
    fingers and thumbs, give it breath wi
th your mouth, and it
will
    discourse most eloquent music. Look you, these are the stops.
  Gu
il. But these cannot I command to any utt'rance of harmony. I
    have not the skill.
  Ham. Why, 
look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me!
You
    would play upon me; you would seem to k
now my stops; you
would
    pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound me from my
    low
est note to the top of my compass; and there is much
music,
    excellent voice, in this little or
gan, yet cannot you make it
    speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am easier to be play'd on than
a
 
   pipe? Call me what instrument you will, though you can fret
me,
    you cannot play upon me.


                        Enter Polonius.

    God bless you, sir!
  Pol. My lord, the Queen would
 speak with you, and presently.
  Ham. Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?

  Pol. By th' mass, and 'tis like a camel indeed.
  Ham. Methinks it is like a weasel.
  Pol. It i
s back'd like a weasel.
  Ham. Or like a whale.
  Pol. Very like a whale.
  Ham. Then will I come
 to my mother by-and-by.- They fool me to
the
    top of my bent.- I will come by-and-by.
  Pol. 
I will say so.                                      Exit.
  Ham. 'By-and-by' is easily said.- Leave
 me, friends.
                                        [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]

    'Tis now the 
very witching time of night,
    When churchyards yawn, and hell itself breathes out
    Contagion
 to this world. Now could I drink hot blood
    And do such bitter business as the day
    Would q
uake to look on. Soft! now to my mother!
    O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever
    The so
ul of Nero enter this firm bosom.
    Let me be cruel, not unnatural;
    I will speak daggers to 
her, but use none.
    My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites-
    How in my words somever she b
e shent,
    To give them seals never, my soul, consent!             Exit.




Scene III.
A r
oom in the Castle.

Enter King, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.

  King. I like him not, nor stan
ds it safe with us
    To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;
    I your commission will
 forthwith dispatch,
    And he to England shall along with you.
    The terms of our estate may n
ot endure
    Hazard so near us as doth hourly grow
    Out of his lunacies.
  Guil. We will ours
elves provide.
    Most holy and religious fear it is
    To keep those many many bodies safe
   
 That live and feed upon your Majesty.
  Ros. The single and peculiar life is bound
    With all t
he strength and armour of the mind
    To keep itself from noyance; but much more
    That spirit 
upon whose weal depends and rests
    The lives of many. The cesse of majesty
    Dies not alone, 
but like a gulf doth draw
    What's near it with it. It is a massy wheel,
    Fix'd on the summit
 of the highest mount,
    To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
    Are mortis'd and ad
join'd; which when it falls,
    Each small annexment, petty consequence,
    Attends the boist'ro
us ruin. Never alone
    Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.
  King. Arm you, I pray you,
 to this speedy voyage;
    For we will fetters put upon this fear,
    Which now goes too free-fo
oted.
  Both. We will haste us.
                                               Exeunt Gentlemen.


                   Enter Polonius.

  Pol. My lord, he's going to his mother's closet.
    Behi
nd the arras I'll convey myself
    To hear the process. I'll warrant she'll tax him home;
    And
, as you said, and wisely was it said,
    'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,
    Si
nce nature makes them partial, should o'erhear
    The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege.

    I'll call upon you ere you go to bed
    And tell you what I know.
  King. Thanks, dear my l
ord.
                                                Exit [Polonius].
    O, my offence is rank, i
t smells to heaven;
    It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,
    A brother's murther! Pray can 
I not,
    Though inclination be as sharp as will.
    My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent,

    And, like a man to double business bound,
    I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
  
  And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
    Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,
  
  Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
    To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy

    But to confront the visage of offence?
    And what's in prayer but this twofold force,
    T
o be forestalled ere we come to fall,
    Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;
    My fault 
is past. But, O, what form of prayer
    Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murther'?
    That
 cannot be; since I am still possess'd
    Of those effects for which I did the murther-
    My cr
own, mine own ambition, and my queen.
    May one be pardon'd and retain th' offence?
    In the c
orrupted currents of this world
    Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,
    And oft 'tis s
een the wicked prize itself
    Buys out the law; but 'tis not so above.
    There is no shuffling
; there the action lies
    In his true nature, and we ourselves compell'd,
    Even to the teeth 
and forehead of our faults,
    To give in evidence. What then? What rests?
    Try what repentanc
e can. What can it not?
    Yet what can it when one cannot repent?
    O wretched state! O bosom 
black as death!
    O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
    Art more engag'd! Help, angels!
 Make assay.
    Bow, stubborn knees; and heart with strings of steel,
    Be soft as sinews of th
e new-born babe!
    All may be well.                                  He kneels.

              
           Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
    And now I'll do't.
 And so he goes to heaven,
    And so am I reveng'd. That would be scann'd.
    A villain kills my
 father; and for that,
    I, his sole son, do this same villain send
    To heaven.
    Why, thi
s is hire and salary, not revenge!
    He took my father grossly, full of bread,
    With all his 
crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
    And how his audit stands, who knows save heaven?
    But 
in our circumstance and course of thought,
    'Tis heavy with him; and am I then reveng'd,
    To
 take him in the purging of his soul,
    When he is fit and seasoned for his passage?
    No.
  
  Up, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent.
    When he is drunk asleep; or in his rage;
    Or
 in th' incestuous pleasure of his bed;
    At gaming, swearing, or about some act
    That has no
 relish of salvation in't-
    Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,
    And that his 
soul may be as damn'd and black
    As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays.
    This physic but
 prolongs thy sickly days.              Exit.
  King. [rises] My words fly up, my thoughts remain b
elow.
    Words without thoughts never to heaven go.             Exit.




Scene IV.
The Quee
n's closet.

Enter Queen and Polonius.

  Pol. He will come straight. Look you lay home to him.

    Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,
    And that your Grace hath screen'd an
d stood between
    Much heat and him. I'll silence me even here.
    Pray you be round with him.

  Ham. (within) Mother, mother, mother!
  Queen. I'll warrant you; fear me not. Withdraw; I hear h
im
coming.
                              [Polonius hides behind the arras.]

                   
       Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Now, mother, what's the matter?
  Queen. Hamlet, thou hast thy fathe
r much offended.
  Ham. Mother, you have my father much offended.
  Queen. Come, come, you answer 
with an idle tongue.
  Ham. Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
  Queen. Why, how now, Haml
et?
  Ham. What's the matter now?
  Queen. Have you forgot me?
  Ham. No, by the rood, not so!
 
   You are the Queen, your husband's brother's wife,
    And (would it were not so!) you are my mot
her.
  Queen. Nay, then I'll set those to you that can speak.
  Ham. Come, come, and sit you down.
 You shall not budge;
    You go not till I set you up a glass
    Where you may see the inmost pa
rt of you.
  Queen. What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murther me?
    Help, help, ho!
  Pol. [behi
nd] What, ho! help, help, help!
  Ham. [draws] How now? a rat? Dead for a ducat, dead!
           
 [Makes a pass through the arras and] kills Polonius.
  Pol. [behind] O, I am slain!
  Queen. O me
, what hast thou done?
  Ham. Nay, I know not. Is it the King?
  Queen. O, what a rash and bloody 
deed is this!
  Ham. A bloody deed- almost as bad, good mother,
    As kill a king, and marry with
 his brother.
  Queen. As kill a king?
  Ham. Ay, lady, it was my word.
                         
[Lifts up the arras and sees Polonius.]
    Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
    I t
ook thee for thy better. Take thy fortune.
    Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.
    Lea
ve wringing of your hands. Peace! sit you down
    And let me wring your heart; for so I shall
   
 If it be made of penetrable stuff;
    If damned custom have not braz'd it so
    That it is proo
f and bulwark against sense.
  Queen. What have I done that thou dar'st wag thy tongue
    In nois
e so rude against me?
  Ham. Such an act
    That blurs the grace and blush of modesty;
    Calls
 virtue hypocrite; takes off the rose
    From the fair forehead of an innocent love,
    And sets
 a blister there; makes marriage vows
    As false as dicers' oaths. O, such a deed
    As from th
e body of contraction plucks
    The very soul, and sweet religion makes
    A rhapsody of words! 
Heaven's face doth glow;
    Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
    With tristful visage, as ag
ainst the doom,
    Is thought-sick at the act.
  Queen. Ah me, what act,
    That roars so loud 
and thunders in the index?
  Ham. Look here upon th's picture, and on this,
    The counterfeit pr
esentment of two brothers.
    See what a grace was seated on this brow;
    Hyperion's curls; the
 front of Jove himself;
    An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
    A station like the hera
ld Mercury
    New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill:
    A combination and a form indeed
    Wher
e every god did seem to set his seal
    To give the world assurance of a man.
    This was your h
usband. Look you now what follows.
    Here is your husband, like a mildew'd ear
    Blasting his 
wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
    Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
    And batte
n on this moor? Ha! have you eyes
    You cannot call it love; for at your age
    The heyday in t
he blood is tame, it's humble,
    And waits upon the judgment; and what judgment
    Would step f
rom this to this? Sense sure you have,
    Else could you not have motion; but sure that sense
   
 Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,
    Nor sense to ecstacy was ne'er so thrall'd
    But i
t reserv'd some quantity of choice
    To serve in such a difference. What devil was't
    That th
us hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
    Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
    Ears wi
thout hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
    Or but a sickly part of one true sense
    Could not s
o mope.
    O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
    If thou canst mutine in a matron's b
ones,
    To flaming youth let virtue be as wax
    And melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame
 
   When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
    Since frost itself as actively doth burn,
    
And reason panders will.
  Queen. O Hamlet, speak no more!
    Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very
 soul,
    And there I see such black and grained spots
    As will not leave their tinct.
  Ham.
 Nay, but to live
    In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
    Stew'd in corruption, honeying and
 making love
    Over the nasty sty!
  Queen. O, speak to me no more!
    These words like dagger
s enter in mine ears.
    No more, sweet Hamlet!
  Ham. A murtherer and a villain!
    A slave th
at is not twentieth part the tithe
    Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
    A cutpurse of 
the empire and the rule,
    That from a shelf the precious diadem stole
    And put it in his poc
ket!
  Queen. No more!

                Enter the Ghost in his nightgown.

  Ham. A king of shr
eds and patches!-
    Save me and hover o'er me with your wings,
    You heavenly guards! What wou
ld your gracious figure?
  Queen. Alas, he's mad!
  Ham. Do you not come your tardy son to chide,

    That, laps'd in time and passion, lets go by
    Th' important acting of your dread command?

    O, say!
  Ghost. Do not forget. This visitation
    Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.

    But look, amazement on thy mother sits.
    O, step between her and her fighting soul
    Co
nceit in weakest bodies strongest works.
    Speak to her, Hamlet.
  Ham. How is it with you, lady
?
  Queen. Alas, how is't with you,
    That you do bend your eye on vacancy,
    And with th' en
corporal air do hold discourse?
    Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
    And, as the s
leeping soldiers in th' alarm,
    Your bedded hairs, like life in excrements,
    Start up and st
and an end. O gentle son,
    Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
    Sprinkle cool patience!
 Whereon do you look?
  Ham. On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!
    His form and cause c
onjoin'd, preaching to stones,
    Would make them capable.- Do not look upon me,
    Lest with th
is piteous action you convert
    My stern effects. Then what I have to do
    Will want true colo
ur- tears perchance for blood.
  Queen. To whom do you speak this?
  Ham. Do you see nothing there
?
  Queen. Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
  Ham. Nor did you nothing hear?
  Queen. No, n
othing but ourselves.
  Ham. Why, look you there! Look how it steals away!
    My father, in his h
abit as he liv'd!
    Look where he goes even now out at the portal!
                             
                        Exit Ghost.
  Queen. This is the very coinage of your brain.
    This bodi
less creation ecstasy
    Is very cunning in.
  Ham. Ecstasy?
    My pulse as yours doth temperat
ely keep time
    And makes as healthful music. It is not madness
    That I have utt'red. Bring m
e to the test,
    And I the matter will reword; which madness
    Would gambol from. Mother, for 
love of grace,
    Lay not that flattering unction to your soul
    That not your trespass but my 
madness speaks.
    It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
    Whiles rank corruption, mini
ng all within,
    Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
    Repent what's past; avoid what 
is to come;
    And do not spread the compost on the weeds
    To make them ranker. Forgive me thi
s my virtue;
    For in the fatness of these pursy times
    Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg
-
    Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.
  Queen. O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in t
wain.
  Ham. O, throw away the worser part of it,
    And live the purer with the other half,
   
 Good night- but go not to my uncle's bed.
    Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
    That monst
er, custom, who all sense doth eat
    Of habits evil, is angel yet in this,
    That to the use o
f actions fair and good
    He likewise gives a frock or livery,
    That aptly is put on. Refrain
 to-night,
    And that shall lend a kind of easiness
    To the next abstinence; the next more ea
sy;
    For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
    And either [master] the devil, or throw
 him out
    With wondrous potency. Once more, good night;
    And when you are desirous to be ble
st,
    I'll blessing beg of you.- For this same lord,
    I do repent; but heaven hath pleas'd it
 so,
    To punish me with this, and this with me,
    That I must be their scourge and minister.

    I will bestow him, and will answer well
    The death I gave him. So again, good night.
    I
 must be cruel, only to be kind;
    Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.
    One word more,
 good lady.
  Queen. What shall I do?
  Ham. Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
    Let th
e bloat King tempt you again to bed;
    Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
    And l
et him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
    Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,
    Mak
e you to ravel all this matter out,
    That I essentially am not in madness,
    But mad in craft
. 'Twere good you let him know;
    For who that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
    Would from 
a paddock, from a bat, a gib
    Such dear concernings hide? Who would do so?
    No, in despite o
f sense and secrecy,
    Unpeg the basket on the house's top,
    Let the birds fly, and like the 
famous ape,
    To try conclusions, in the basket creep
    And break your own neck down.
  Queen
. Be thou assur'd, if words be made of breath,
    And breath of life, I have no life to breathe
 
   What thou hast said to me.
  Ham. I must to England; you know that?
  Queen. Alack,
    I had 
forgot! 'Tis so concluded on.
  Ham. There's letters seal'd; and my two schoolfellows,
    Whom I 
will trust as I will adders fang'd,
    They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way
    And mars
hal me to knavery. Let it work;
    For 'tis the sport to have the enginer
    Hoist with his own 
petar; and 't shall go hard
    But I will delve one yard below their mines
    And blow them at t
he moon. O, 'tis most sweet
    When in one line two crafts directly meet.
    This man shall set 
me packing.
    I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.-
    Mother, good night.- Indeed, this 
counsellor
    Is now most still, most secret, and most grave,

ACT IV. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King 
and Queen, with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  King. There's matter in these sighs. These profou
nd heaves
    You must translate; 'tis fit we understand them.
    Where is your son?
  Queen. Be
stow this place on us a little while.
                          [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenster
n.]
    Ah, mine own lord, what have I seen to-night!
  King. What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
  
Queen. Mad as the sea and wind when both contend
    Which is the mightier. In his lawless fit
   
 Behind the arras hearing something stir,
    Whips out his rapier, cries 'A rat, a rat!'
    And 
in this brainish apprehension kills
    The unseen good old man.
  King. O heavy deed!
    It had
 been so with us, had we been there.
    His liberty is full of threats to all-
    To you yoursel
f, to us, to every one.
    Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
    It will be laid to u
s, whose providence
    Should have kept short, restrain'd, and out of haunt
    This mad young ma
n. But so much was our love
    We would not understand what was most fit,
    But, like the owner
 of a foul disease,
    To keep it from divulging, let it feed
    Even on the pith of life. Where
 is he gone?
  Queen. To draw apart the body he hath kill'd;
    O'er whom his very madness, like 
some ore
    Among a mineral of metals base,
    Shows itself pure. He weeps for what is done.
  
King. O Gertrude, come away!
    The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch
    But we will ship 
him hence; and this vile deed
    We must with all our majesty and skill
    Both countenance and 
excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!

             Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

    Friends both, g
o join you with some further aid.
    Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
    And from his moth
er's closet hath he dragg'd him.
    Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body
    Into the 
chapel. I pray you haste in this.
                          Exeunt [Rosencrantz and Guildenstern].

    Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends
    And let them know both what we mean to do

    And what's untimely done. [So haply slander-]
    Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter,
 
   As level as the cannon to his blank,
    Transports his poisoned shot- may miss our name
    An
d hit the woundless air.- O, come away!
    My soul is full of discord and dismay.
               
                                          Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A passage in the Cas
tle.

Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Safely stow'd.
  Gentlemen. (within) Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!
  Ham. B
ut soft! What noise? Who calls on Hamlet? O, here they
come.

               Enter Rosencrantz an
d Guildenstern.

  Ros. What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
  Ham. Compounded it wit
h dust, whereto 'tis kin.
  Ros. Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
    And bear it to
 the chapel.
  Ham. Do not believe it.
  Ros. Believe what?
  Ham. That I can keep your counsel, 
and not mine own. Besides,
to be
    demanded of a sponge, what replication should be made by the

son
    of a king?
  Ros. Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
  Ham. Ay, sir; that soaks up the K
ing's countenance, his
rewards,
    his authorities. But such officers do the King best service
i
n
    the end. He keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his
jaw;
    first mouth'd, to be las
t swallowed. When he needs what you
have
    glean'd, it is but squeezing you and, sponge, you sha
ll be
dry
    again.
  Ros. I understand you not, my lord.
  Ham. I am glad of it. A knavish spe
ech sleeps in a foolish ear.
  Ros. My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us
to

    the King.
  Ham. The body is with the King, but the King is not with the
body.
    The King 
is a thing-
  Guil. A thing, my lord?
  Ham. Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.

                                                         Exeunt.




Scene III.
Elsinore. A 
room in the Castle.

Enter King.

  King. I have sent to seek him and to find the body.
    How
 dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
    Yet must not we put the strong law on him.
    He's
 lov'd of the distracted multitude,
    Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;
    And wh
ere 'tis so, th' offender's scourge is weigh'd,
    But never the offence. To bear all smooth and e
ven,
    This sudden sending him away must seem
    Deliberate pause. Diseases desperate grown
  
  By desperate appliance are reliev'd,
    Or not at all.

                    Enter Rosencrantz.


    How now O What hath befall'n?
  Ros. Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
    We cann
ot get from him.
  King. But where is he?
  Ros. Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.

  King. Bring him before us.
  Ros. Ho, Guildenstern! Bring in my lord.

        Enter Hamlet a
nd Guildenstern [with Attendants].

  King. Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
  Ham. At supper.
  K
ing. At supper? Where?
  Ham. Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A certain
    convocation 
of politic worms are e'en at him. Your worm is
your
    only emperor for diet. We fat all creature
s else to fat us,
and
    we fat ourselves for maggots. Your fat king and your lean
beggar
    i
s but variable service- two dishes, but to one table. That's
the
    end.
  King. Alas, alas!
  
Ham. A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and
eat
    of the fish that hath fed o
f that worm.
  King. What dost thou mean by this?
  Ham. Nothing but to show you how a king may go
 a progress
through
    the guts of a beggar.
  King. Where is Polonius?
  Ham. In heaven. Send 
thither to see. If your messenger find him
not
    there, seek him i' th' other place yourself. Bu
t indeed, if
you
    find him not within this month, you shall nose him as you go
up
    the sta
ir, into the lobby.
  King. Go seek him there. [To Attendants.]
  Ham. He will stay till you come.

                                            [Exeunt Attendants.]
  King. Hamlet, this deed, for t
hine especial safety,-
    Which we do tender as we dearly grieve
    For that which thou hast don
e,- must send thee hence
    With fiery quickness. Therefore prepare thyself.
    The bark is read
y and the wind at help,
    Th' associates tend, and everything is bent
    For England.
  Ham. F
or England?
  King. Ay, Hamlet.
  Ham. Good.
  King. So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
  H
am. I see a cherub that sees them. But come, for England!
    Farewell, dear mother.
  King. Thy l
oving father, Hamlet.
  Ham. My mother! Father and mother is man and wife; man and wife
is
    on
e flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England!
Exit.
  King. Follow him at foot; tempt him with sp
eed aboard.
    Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night.
    Away! for everything is seal'd and
 done
    That else leans on th' affair. Pray you make haste.
                            Exeunt R
osencrantz and Guildenstern]
    And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught,-
    As my great 
power thereof may give thee sense,
    Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
    After the Dan
ish sword, and thy free awe
    Pays homage to us,- thou mayst not coldly set
    Our sovereign pr
ocess, which imports at full,
    By letters congruing to that effect,
    The present death of Ha
mlet. Do it, England;
    For like the hectic in my blood he rages,
    And thou must cure me. Til
l I know 'tis done,
    Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.             Exit.

Scene IV.
Near Elsinore.

Enter Fortinbras with his Army over the stage.

  For. Go, Cap
tain, from me greet the Danish king.
    Tell him that by his license Fortinbras
    Craves the co
nveyance of a promis'd march
    Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.
    If that his Majest
y would aught with us,
    We shall express our duty in his eye;
    And let him know so.
  Capt.
 I will do't, my lord.
  For. Go softly on.
                                   Exeunt [all but the
 Captain].

       Enter Hamlet, Rosencrantz, [Guildenstern,] and others.

  Ham. Good sir, whos
e powers are these?
  Capt. They are of Norway, sir.
  Ham. How purpos'd, sir, I pray you?
  Capt
. Against some part of Poland.
  Ham. Who commands them, sir?
  Capt. The nephew to old Norway, Fo
rtinbras.
  Ham. Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
    Or for some frontier?
  Capt. Truly
 to speak, and with no addition,
    We go to gain a little patch of ground
    That hath in it no
 profit but the name.
    To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
    Nor will it yield to 
Norway or the Pole
    A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
  Ham. Why, then the Polack never 
will defend it.
  Capt. Yes, it is already garrison'd.
  Ham. Two thousand souls and twenty thousa
nd ducats
    Will not debate the question of this straw.
    This is th' imposthume of much wealt
h and peace,
    That inward breaks, and shows no cause without
    Why the man dies.- I humbly th
ank you, sir.
  Capt. God b' wi' you, sir.                             [Exit.]
  Ros. Will't pleas
e you go, my lord?
  Ham. I'll be with you straight. Go a little before.
                         
               [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]
    How all occasions do inform against me
    And spur my
 dull revenge! What is a man,
    If his chief good and market of his time
    Be but to sleep and
 feed? A beast, no more.
    Sure he that made us with such large discourse,
    Looking before an
d after, gave us not
    That capability and godlike reason
    To fust in us unus'd. Now, whether
 it be
    Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple
    Of thinking too precisely on th' event,-

    A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
    And ever three parts coward,- I do not
 know
    Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do,'
    Sith I have cause, and will, and strengt
h, and means
    To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me.
    Witness this army of such mass an
d charge,
    Led by a delicate and tender prince,
    Whose spirit, with divine ambition puff'd,

    Makes mouths at the invisible event,
    Exposing what is mortal and unsure
    To all that f
ortune, death, and danger dare,
    Even for an eggshell. Rightly to be great
    Is not to stir w
ithout great argument,
    But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
    When honour's at the stake. 
How stand I then,
    That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,
    Excitements of my reason an
d my blood,
    And let all sleep, while to my shame I see
    The imminent death of twenty thousa
nd men
    That for a fantasy and trick of fame
    Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot

    Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
    Which is not tomb enough and continent
    To 
hide the slain? O, from this time forth,
    My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!           
 Exit.

Scene V.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter Horatio, Queen, and a
 Gentleman.

  Queen. I will not speak with her.
  Gent. She is importunate, indeed distract.
  
  Her mood will needs be pitied.
  Queen. What would she have?
  Gent. She speaks much of her fath
er; says she hears
    There's tricks i' th' world, and hems, and beats her heart;
    Spurns envi
ously at straws; speaks things in doubt,
    That carry but half sense. Her speech is nothing,
   
 Yet the unshaped use of it doth move
    The hearers to collection; they aim at it,
    And botch
 the words up fit to their own thoughts;
    Which, as her winks and nods and gestures yield them,

    Indeed would make one think there might be thought,
    Though nothing sure, yet much unhappil
y.
  Hor. 'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew
    Dangerous conjectures in ill-bre
eding minds.
  Queen. Let her come in.
                                               [Exit Gentle
man.]
    [Aside] To my sick soul (as sin's true nature is)
    Each toy seems Prologue to some gr
eat amiss.
    So full of artless jealousy is guilt
    It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.


                 Enter Ophelia distracted.

  Oph. Where is the beauteous Majesty of Denmark?
 
 Queen. How now, Ophelia?
  Oph. (sings)
         How should I your true-love know
           Fro
m another one?
         By his cockle bat and' staff
           And his sandal shoon.

  Queen. 
Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
  Oph. Say you? Nay, pray You mark.

    (Sings) He is 
dead and gone, lady,
              He is dead and gone;
            At his head a grass-green turf
,
              At his heels a stone.

    O, ho!
  Queen. Nay, but Ophelia-
  Oph. Pray you ma
rk.

    (Sings) White his shroud as the mountain snow-

                    Enter King.

  Qu
een. Alas, look here, my lord!
  Oph. (Sings)
           Larded all with sweet flowers;
         
Which bewept to the grave did not go
           With true-love showers.

  King. How do you, pret
ty lady?
  Oph. Well, God dild you! They say the owl was a baker's
daughter.
    Lord, we know wh
at we are, but know not what we may be. God
be at
    your table!
  King. Conceit upon her father
.
  Oph. Pray let's have no words of this; but when they ask, you
what
    it means, say you this
:

    (Sings) To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,
              All in the morning bedtime,
   
         And I a maid at your window,
              To be your Valentine.

            Then up he
 rose and donn'd his clo'es
              And dupp'd the chamber door,
            Let in the maid
, that out a maid
              Never departed more.

  King. Pretty Ophelia!
  Oph. Indeed, la,
 without an oath, I'll make an end on't!

    [Sings] By Gis and by Saint Charity,
              
Alack, and fie for shame!
            Young men will do't if they come to't
              By Cock,
 they are to blame.

            Quoth she, 'Before you tumbled me,
              You promis'd me
 to wed.'

    He answers:

            'So would I 'a' done, by yonder sun,
              An t
hou hadst not come to my bed.'

  King. How long hath she been thus?
  Oph. I hope all will be we
ll. We must be patient; but I cannot
    choose but weep to think they would lay him i' th' cold
g
round.
    My brother shall know of it; and so I thank you for your good
    counsel. Come, my coa
ch! Good night, ladies. Good night,
sweet
    ladies. Good night, good night.                     
    Exit
  King. Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.
                              
                   [Exit Horatio.]

    O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs
    All f
rom her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
    When sorrows come, they come not single spies.
 
   But in battalions! First, her father slain;
    Next, your son gone, and he most violent author

    Of his own just remove; the people muddied,
    Thick and and unwholesome in their thoughts an
d whispers
    For good Polonius' death, and we have done but greenly
    In hugger-mugger to inte
r him; poor Ophelia
    Divided from herself and her fair judgment,
    Without the which we are p
ictures or mere beasts;
    Last, and as much containing as all these,
    Her brother is in secre
t come from France;
    And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
    Feeds on his wonder, keep, him
self in clouds,
    With pestilent speeches of his father's death,
    Wherein necessity, of matte
r beggar'd,
    Will nothing stick our person to arraign
    In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, t
his,
    Like to a murd'ring piece, in many places
    Give me superfluous death.                 
 A noise within.
  Queen. Alack, what noise is this?
  King. Where are my Switzers? Let them guard
 the door.

                     Enter a Messenger.

    What is the matter?
  Mess. Save Yours
elf, my lord:
    The ocean, overpeering of his list,
    Eats not the flats with more impetuous h
aste
    Than Young Laertes, in a riotous head,
    O'erbears Your offices. The rabble call him lo
rd;
    And, as the world were now but to begin,
    Antiquity forgot, custom not known,
    The 
ratifiers and props of every word,
    They cry 'Choose we! Laertes shall be king!'
    Caps, hand
s, and tongues applaud it to the clouds,
    'Laertes shall be king! Laertes king!'
              
                                   A noise within.
  Queen. How cheerfully on the false trail they 
cry!
    O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!
  King. The doors are broke.

              
      Enter Laertes with others.

  Laer. Where is this king?- Sirs, staid you all without.
  All
. No, let's come in!
  Laer. I pray you give me leave.
  All. We will, we will!
  Laer. I thank y
ou. Keep the door.      [Exeunt his Followers.]
    O thou vile king,
    Give me my father!
  Qu
een. Calmly, good Laertes.
  Laer. That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard;
    Cries 
cuckold to my father; brands the harlot
    Even here between the chaste unsmirched brows
    Of m
y true mother.
  King. What is the cause, Laertes,
    That thy rebellion looks so giantlike?
   
 Let him go, Gertrude. Do not fear our person.
    There's such divinity doth hedge a king
    Tha
t treason can but peep to what it would,
    Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,
    Why th
ou art thus incens'd. Let him go, Gertrude.
    Speak, man.
  Laer. Where is my father?
  King. D
ead.
  Queen. But not by him!
  King. Let him demand his fill.
  Laer. How came he dead? I'll not
 be juggled with:
    To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil
    Conscience and grace, t
o the profoundest pit!
    I dare damnation. To this point I stand,
    That both the world, I giv
e to negligence,
    Let come what comes; only I'll be reveng'd
    Most throughly for my father.

  King. Who shall stay you?
  Laer. My will, not all the world!
    And for my means, I'll husban
d them so well
    They shall go far with little.
  King. Good Laertes,
    If you desire to know
 the certainty
    Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge
    That sweepstake you 
will draw both friend and foe,
    Winner and loser?
  Laer. None but his enemies.
  King. Will y
ou know them then?
  Laer. To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms
    And, like the kind l
ife-rend'ring pelican,
    Repast them with my blood.
  King. Why, now You speak
    Like a good 
child and a true gentleman.
    That I am guiltless of your father's death,
    And am most sensib
ly in grief for it,
    It shall as level to your judgment pierce
    As day does to your eye.
  
                            A noise within: 'Let her come in.'
  Laer. How now? What noise is that?


                      Enter Ophelia.

    O heat, dry up my brains! Tears seven times salt
  
  Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!
    By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight
  
  Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!
    Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
    O he
avens! is't possible a young maid's wits
    Should be as mortal as an old man's life?
    Nature 
is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,
    It sends some precious instance of itself
    After the 
thing it loves.

  Oph. (sings)
         They bore him barefac'd on the bier
           (Hey non
 nony, nony, hey nony)
         And in his grave rain'd many a tear.

    Fare you well, my dove!

  Laer. Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
    It could not move thus.
  Oph. You 
must sing 'A-down a-down, and you call him a-down-a.'
O,
    how the wheel becomes it! It is the f
alse steward, that stole
his
    master's daughter.
  Laer. This nothing's more than matter.
  O
ph. There's rosemary, that's for remembrance. Pray you, love,
    remember. And there is pansies, t
hat's for thoughts.
  Laer. A document in madness! Thoughts and remembrance fitted.
  Oph. There's
 fennel for you, and columbines. There's rue for
you,
    and here's some for me. We may call it h
erb of grace o'
Sundays.
    O, you must wear your rue with a difference! There's a daisy.
I
   
 would give you some violets, but they wither'd all when my
father
    died. They say he made a go
od end.

    [Sings] For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.

  Laer. Thought and affliction, passi
on, hell itself,
    She turns to favour and to prettiness.
  Oph. (sings)
         And will he n
ot come again?
         And will he not come again?
           No, no, he is dead;
           Go 
to thy deathbed;
         He never will come again.

         His beard was as white as snow,
  
       All flaxen was his poll.
           He is gone, he is gone,
           And we cast away moa
n.
         God 'a'mercy on his soul!

    And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God b' wi' you
.
Exit.
  Laer. Do you see this, O God?
  King. Laertes, I must commune with your grief,
    Or 
you deny me right. Go but apart,
    Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will,
    And the
y shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me.
    If by direct or by collateral hand
    They find us 
touch'd, we will our kingdom give,
    Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours,
    To you 
in satisfaction; but if not,
    Be you content to lend your patience to us,
    And we shall join
tly labour with your soul
    To give it due content.
  Laer. Let this be so.
    His means of de
ath, his obscure funeral-
    No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,
    No noble rite no
r formal ostentation,-
    Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
    That I must call't
 in question.
  King. So you shall;
    And where th' offence is let the great axe fall.
    I pr
ay you go with me.
                                                          Exeunt

Scene VI.
Elsinore. Another room in the Castle.

Enter Horatio with an Attendant.

  Hor.
 What are they that would speak with me?
  Servant. Seafaring men, sir. They say they have letters 
for
you.
  Hor. Let them come in.
                                               [Exit Attendant.
]
    I do not know from what part of the world
    I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.


                          Enter Sailors.

  Sailor. God bless you, sir.
  Hor. Let him bless t
hee too.
  Sailor. 'A shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter for
you,
    sir,- it comes f
rom th' ambassador that was bound for
England- if
    your name be Horatio, as I am let to know it
 is.
  Hor. (reads the letter) 'Horatio, when thou shalt have
overlook'd
    this, give these fel
lows some means to the King. They have
    letters for him. Ere we were two days old at sea, a pira
te of

    very warlike appointment gave us chase. Finding ourselves too
    slow of sail, we put
 on a compelled valour, and in the
grapple I
    boarded them. On the instant they got clear of ou
r ship; so I
    alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with me like
thieves
    of mercy; 
but they knew what they did: I am to do a good turn
for
    them. Let the King have the letters I 
have sent, and repair
thou
    to me with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death. I have
words

    to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb; yet are they much
too
    light for the bore of the
 matter. These good fellows will
bring
    thee where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold thei
r
course
    for England. Of them I have much to tell thee. Farewell.
                           
 'He that thou knowest thine, HAMLET.'

    Come, I will give you way for these your letters,
   
 And do't the speedier that you may direct me
    To him from whom you brought them.               
    Exeunt.

Scene VII.
Elsinore. Another room in the Castle.

Enter King and
 Laertes.

  King. Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
    And You must put me in your 
heart for friend,
    Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
    That he which hath your nob
le father slain
    Pursued my life.
  Laer. It well appears. But tell me
    Why you proceeded n
ot against these feats
    So crimeful and so capital in nature,
    As by your safety, wisdom, al
l things else,
    You mainly were stirr'd up.
  King. O, for two special reasons,
    Which may 
to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,
    But yet to me they are strong. The Queen his mother
    
Lives almost by his looks; and for myself,-
    My virtue or my plague, be it either which,-
    S
he's so conjunctive to my life and soul
    That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
    I c
ould not but by her. The other motive
    Why to a public count I might not go
    Is the great lo
ve the general gender bear him,
    Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
    Would, lik
e the spring that turneth wood to stone,
    Convert his gives to graces; so that my arrows,
    T
oo slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,
    Would have reverted to my bow again,
    And not wher
e I had aim'd them.
  Laer. And so have I a noble father lost;
    A sister driven into desp'rate 
terms,
    Whose worth, if praises may go back again,
    Stood challenger on mount of all the age

    For her perfections. But my revenge will come.
  King. Break not your sleeps for that. You mu
st not think
    That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
    That we can let our beard be shook
 with danger,
    And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more.
    I lov'd your father, and 
we love ourself,
    And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine-

                 Enter a Messe
nger with letters.

    How now? What news?
  Mess. Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:
    This to y
our Majesty; this to the Queen.
  King. From Hamlet? Who brought them?
  Mess. Sailors, my lord, t
hey say; I saw them not.
    They were given me by Claudio; he receiv'd them
    Of him that broug
ht them.
  King. Laertes, you shall hear them.
    Leave us.
                                    
             Exit Messenger.
    [Reads]'High and Mighty,-You shall know I am set naked on
your
 
   kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes;
    when I shall (first asking you
r pardon thereunto) recount the
    occasion of my sudden and more strange return.
               
                                      'HAMLET.'
    What should this mean? Are all the rest come ba
ck?
    Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?
  Laer. Know you the hand?
  King. 'Tis Hamlet's 
character. 'Naked!'
    And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'
    Can you advise me?
  Laer.
 I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come!
    It warms the very sickness in my heart
    That I
 shall live and tell him to his teeth,
    'Thus didest thou.'
  King. If it be so, Laertes
    (
As how should it be so? how otherwise?),
    Will you be rul'd by me?
  Laer. Ay my lord,
    So 
you will not o'errule me to a peace.
  King. To thine own peace. If he be now return'd
    As chec
king at his voyage, and that he means
    No more to undertake it, I will work him
    To exploit 
now ripe in my device,
    Under the which he shall not choose but fall;
    And for his death no 
wind shall breathe
    But even his mother shall uncharge the practice
    And call it accident.

  Laer. My lord, I will be rul'd;
    The rather, if you could devise it so
    That I might be th
e organ.
  King. It falls right.
    You have been talk'd of since your travel much,
    And that
 in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality
    Wherein they say you shine, Your sum of parts
    Did not 
together pluck such envy from him
    As did that one; and that, in my regard,
    Of the unworthi
est siege.
  Laer. What part is that, my lord?
  King. A very riband in the cap of youth-
    Yet
 needfull too; for youth no less becomes
    The light and careless livery that it wears
    Than 
settled age his sables and his weeds,
    Importing health and graveness. Two months since
    Her
e was a gentleman of Normandy.
    I have seen myself, and serv'd against, the French,
    And the
y can well on horseback; but this gallant
    Had witchcraft in't. He grew unto his seat,
    And 
to such wondrous doing brought his horse
    As had he been incorps'd and demi-natur'd
    With th
e brave beast. So far he topp'd my thought
    That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
    Come s
hort of what he did.
  Laer. A Norman was't?
  King. A Norman.
  Laer. Upon my life, Lamound.
  
King. The very same.
  Laer. I know him well. He is the broach indeed
    And gem of all the natio
n.
  King. He made confession of you;
    And gave you such a masterly report
    For art and exe
rcise in your defence,
    And for your rapier most especially,
    That he cried out 'twould be a
 sight indeed
    If one could match you. The scrimers of their nation
    He swore had neither mo
tion, guard, nor eye,
    If you oppos'd them. Sir, this report of his
    Did Hamlet so envenom w
ith his envy
    That he could nothing do but wish and beg
    Your sudden coming o'er to play wit
h you.
    Now, out of this-
  Laer. What out of this, my lord?
  King. Laertes, was your father 
dear to you?
    Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
    A face without a heart,'
  Laer. W
hy ask you this?
  King. Not that I think you did not love your father;
    But that I know love i
s begun by time,
    And that I see, in passages of proof,
    Time qualifies the spark and fire o
f it.
    There lives within the very flame of love
    A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it
;
    And nothing is at a like goodness still;
    For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
    Dies i
n his own too-much. That we would do,
    We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes,
  
  And hath abatements and delays as many
    As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
    A
nd then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
    That hurts by easing. But to the quick o' th'
 ulcer!
    Hamlet comes back. What would you undertake
    To show yourself your father's son in 
deed
    More than in words?
  Laer. To cut his throat i' th' church!
  King. No place indeed sho
uld murther sanctuarize;
    Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,
    Will you do thi
s? Keep close within your chamber.
    Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home.
    We'll put
 on those shall praise your excellence
    And set a double varnish on the fame
    The Frenchman 
gave you; bring you in fine together
    And wager on your heads. He, being remiss,
    Most gener
ous, and free from all contriving,
    Will not peruse the foils; so that with ease,
    Or with a
 little shuffling, you may choose
    A sword unbated, and, in a pass of practice,
    Requite him
 for your father.
  Laer. I will do't!
    And for that purpose I'll anoint my sword.
    I bough
t an unction of a mountebank,
    So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
    Where it draws blood 
no cataplasm so rare,
    Collected from all simples that have virtue
    Under the moon, can save
 the thing from death
    This is but scratch'd withal. I'll touch my point
    With this contagio
n, that, if I gall him slightly,
    It may be death.
  King. Let's further think of this,
    We
igh what convenience both of time and means
    May fit us to our shape. If this should fall,
    
And that our drift look through our bad performance.
    'Twere better not assay'd. Therefore this 
project
    Should have a back or second, that might hold
    If this did blast in proof. Soft! le
t me see.
    We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings-
    I ha't!
    When in your motion you
 are hot and dry-
    As make your bouts more violent to that end-
    And that he calls for drink
, I'll have prepar'd him
    A chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,
    If he by chance esc
ape your venom'd stuck,
    Our purpose may hold there.- But stay, what noise,

                 
          Enter Queen.

    How now, sweet queen?
  Queen. One woe doth tread upon another's heel
,
    So fast they follow. Your sister's drown'd, Laertes.
  Laer. Drown'd! O, where?
  Queen. Th
ere is a willow grows aslant a brook,
    That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream.
    The
re with fantastic garlands did she come
    Of crowflowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,
  
  That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
    But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call the
m.
    There on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds
    Clamb'ring to hang, an envious sliver bro
ke,
    When down her weedy trophies and herself
    Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread
 wide
    And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up;
    Which time she chaunted snatches of old 
tunes,
    As one incapable of her own distress,
    Or like a creature native and indued
    Unt
o that element; but long it could not be
    Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
    P
ull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay
    To muddy death.
  Laer. Alas, then she is drown'd
?
  Queen. Drown'd, drown'd.
  Laer. Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
    And therefore
 I forbid my tears; but yet
    It is our trick; nature her custom holds,
    Let shame say what i
t will. When these are gone,
    The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord.
    I have a speech of fir
e, that fain would blaze
    But that this folly douts it.                          Exit.
  King. 
Let's follow, Gertrude.
    How much I had to do to calm his rage I
    Now fear I this will give 
it start again;
    Therefore let's follow.
                                                      
   Exeunt.

ACT V. Scene I.
Elsinore. A churchyard.

Enter two Clowns, [with 
spades and pickaxes].

  Clown. Is she to be buried in Christian burial when she
wilfully
    se
eks her own salvation?
  Other. I tell thee she is; therefore make her grave straight.
    The cro
wner hath sate on her, and finds it Christian burial.
  Clown. How can that be, unless she drown'd 
herself in her own
    defence?
  Other. Why, 'tis found so.
  Clown. It must be se offendendo; i
t cannot be else. For here
lies
    the point: if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act; and

an
    act hath three branches-it is to act, to do, and to perform;
    argal, she drown'd hersel
f wittingly.
  Other. Nay, but hear you, Goodman Delver!
  Clown. Give me leave. Here lies the wat
er; good. Here stands
the
    man; good. If the man go to this water and drown himself, it
is,
 
   will he nill he, he goes- mark you that. But if the water
come to
    him and drown him, he dro
wns not himself. Argal, he that is
not
    guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.
  O
ther. But is this law?
  Clown. Ay, marry, is't- crowner's quest law.
  Other. Will you ha' the tr
uth an't? If this had not been a
    gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o' Christian
bur
ial.
  Clown. Why, there thou say'st! And the more pity that great
folk
    should have count'nan
ce in this world to drown or hang
themselves
    more than their even-Christian. Come, my spade! T
here is no
    ancient gentlemen but gard'ners, ditchers, and grave-makers.
They
    hold up Adam
's profession.
  Other. Was he a gentleman?
  Clown. 'A was the first that ever bore arms.
  Othe
r. Why, he had none.
  Clown. What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the
Scripture?
    Th
e Scripture says Adam digg'd. Could he dig without arms?
I'll
    put another question to thee. If
 thou answerest me not to the
    purpose, confess thyself-
  Other. Go to!
  Clown. What is he t
hat builds stronger than either the mason,
the
    shipwright, or the carpenter?
  Other. The gal
lows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand
    tenants.
  Clown. I like thy wit well, in good 
faith. The gallows does
well.
    But how does it well? It does well to those that do ill. Now,
 
   thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the
    church. Argal, the gallows may d
o well to thee. To't again,
come!
  Other. Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a
 
   carpenter?
  Clown. Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
  Other. Marry, now I can tell!
  Clown. To'
t.
  Other. Mass, I cannot tell.

                 Enter Hamlet and Horatio afar off.

  Clown.
 Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull ass
will
    not mend his pace with beating; an
d when you are ask'd this
    question next, say 'a grave-maker.' The houses he makes lasts
    ti
ll doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan; fetch me a stoup of
    liquor.
                            
                [Exit Second Clown.]


                       [Clown digs and] sings.

       I
n youth when I did love, did love,
         Methought it was very sweet;
       To contract- O- th
e time for- a- my behove,
         O, methought there- a- was nothing- a- meet.

  Ham. Has this 
fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings
at
    grave-making?
  Hor. Custom hath made it 
in him a property of easiness.
  Ham. 'Tis e'en so. The hand of little employment hath the
daintie
r
    sense.
  Clown. (sings)
         But age with his stealing steps
           Hath clawed me
 in his clutch,
         And hath shipped me intil the land,
           As if I had never been suc
h.
                                            [Throws up a skull.]

  Ham. That skull had a tong
ue in it, and could sing once. How
the
    knave jowls it to the ground,as if 'twere Cain's jawbon
e,
that
    did the first murther! This might be the pate of a
Politician,
    which this ass no
w o'erreaches; one that would circumvent
God,
    might it not?
  Hor. It might, my lord.
  Ham.
 Or of a courtier, which could say 'Good morrow, sweet
lord!
    How dost thou, good lord?' This m
ight be my Lord Such-a-one,
that
    prais'd my Lord Such-a-one's horse when he meant to beg it-

might
    it not?
  Hor. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Why, e'en so! and now my Lady Worm's, chapless, and

knock'd
    about the mazzard with a sexton's spade. Here's fine
revolution,
    and we had the 
trick to see't. Did these bones cost no more
the
    breeding but to play at loggets with 'em? Min
e ache to think
    on't.
  Clown. (Sings)
         A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,
           F
or and a shrouding sheet;
         O, a Pit of clay for to be made
           For such a guest is 
meet.
                                      Throws up [another skull].

  Ham. There's another. W
hy may not that be the skull of a
lawyer?
    Where be his quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, 
his
tenures,
    and his tricks? Why does he suffer this rude knave now to
knock
    him about t
he sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell
him
    of his action of battery? Hum! This fello
w might be in's time
a
    great buyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizances,
his
    fi
nes, his double vouchers, his recoveries. Is this the fine
of
    his fines, and the recovery of h
is recoveries, to have his
fine
    pate full of fine dirt? Will his vouchers vouch him no more
o
f
    his purchases, and double ones too, than the length and
breadth
    of a pair of indentures
? The very conveyances of his lands
will
    scarcely lie in this box; and must th' inheritor hims
elf have
no
    more, ha?
  Hor. Not a jot more, my lord.
  Ham. Is not parchment made of sheeps
kins?
  Hor. Ay, my lord, And of calveskins too.
  Ham. They are sheep and calves which seek out a
ssurance in
that. I
    will speak to this fellow. Whose grave's this, sirrah?
  Clown. Mine, sir
.

    [Sings] O, a pit of clay for to be made
              For such a guest is meet.

  Ham. 
I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in't.
  Clown. You lie out on't, sir, and therefore 'tis
 not yours.
    For my part, I do not lie in't, yet it is mine.
  Ham. Thou dost lie in't, to be i
n't and say it is thine. 'Tis
for
    the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.
  Clown.
 'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away again from me to you.
  Ham. What man dost thou dig it for?
  
Clown. For no man, sir.
  Ham. What woman then?
  Clown. For none neither.
  Ham. Who is to be bu
ried in't?
  Clown. One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's
dead.
  Ham. How absolut
e the knave is! We must speak by the card, or
    equivocation will undo us. By the Lord, Horatio, 
this three
years
    I have taken note of it, the age is grown so picked that the
toe
    of the
 peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he
galls
    his kibe.- How long hast thou been a 
grave-maker?
  Clown. Of all the days i' th' year, I came to't that day that
our
    last king Ha
mlet overcame Fortinbras.
  Ham. How long is that since?
  Clown. Cannot you tell that? Every fool
 can tell that. It was
the
    very day that young Hamlet was born- he that is mad, and sent
    
into England.
  Ham. Ay, marry, why was be sent into England?
  Clown. Why, because 'a was mad. 'A
 shall recover his wits
there;
    or, if 'a do not, 'tis no great matter there.
  Ham. Why?
  C
lown. 'Twill not he seen in him there. There the men are as
mad as
    he.
  Ham. How came he mad
?
  Clown. Very strangely, they say.
  Ham. How strangely?
  Clown. Faith, e'en with losing his w
its.
  Ham. Upon what ground?
  Clown. Why, here in Denmark. I have been sexton here, man and
boy

    thirty years.
  Ham. How long will a man lie i' th' earth ere he rot?
  Clown. Faith, if 'a 
be not rotten before 'a die (as we have
many
    pocky corses now-a-days that will scarce hold the
 laying in,
I
    will last you some eight year or nine year. A tanner will
last
    you nine ye
ar.
  Ham. Why he more than another?
  Clown. Why, sir, his hide is so tann'd with his trade that 
'a
will
    keep out water a great while; and your water is a sore
decayer of
    your whoreson 
dead body. Here's a skull now. This skull hath
lien
    you i' th' earth three-and-twenty years.

  Ham. Whose was it?
  Clown. A whoreson, mad fellow's it was. Whose do you think it
was?
  Ham. 
Nay, I know not.
  Clown. A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! 'A pour'd a flagon
of
    Rhenish 
on my head once. This same skull, sir, was Yorick's
    skull, the King's jester.
  Ham. This?
  
Clown. E'en that.
  Ham. Let me see. [Takes the skull.] Alas, poor Yorick! I knew
him,
    Horati
o. A fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy.
He
    hath borne me on his back a thousand
 times. And now how
abhorred
    in my imagination it is! My gorge rises at it. Here hung
those

    lips that I have kiss'd I know not how oft. Where be your
gibes
    now? your gambols? your so
ngs? your flashes of merriment that
    were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock

your
    own grinning? Quite chap- fall'n? Now get you to my lady's
    chamber, and tell her, le
t her paint an inch thick, to this
    favour she must come. Make her laugh at that. Prithee,
Hora
tio,
    tell me one thing.
  Hor. What's that, my lord?
  Ham. Dost thou think Alexander look'd 
o' this fashion i' th'
earth?
  Hor. E'en so.
  Ham. And smelt so? Pah!
                        
                  [Puts down the skull.]
  Hor. E'en so, my lord.
  Ham. To what base uses we may 
return, Horatio! Why may not
    imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it
   
 stopping a bunghole?
  Hor. 'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.
  Ham. No, faith, n
ot a jot; but to follow him thither with
modesty
    enough, and likelihood to lead it; as thus: A
lexander died,
    Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust
is
    earth; of
 earth we make loam; and why of that loam (whereto
he
    was converted) might they not stop a bee
r barrel?
    Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
    Might stop a hole to keep the wind aw
ay.
    O, that that earth which kept the world in awe
    Should patch a wall t' expel the winter
's flaw!
    But soft! but soft! aside! Here comes the King-

    Enter [priests with] a coffin [
in funeral procession], King,
             Queen, Laertes, with Lords attendant.]

    The Queen,
 the courtiers. Who is this they follow?
    And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken
    The
 corse they follow did with desp'rate hand
    Fordo it own life. 'Twas of some estate.
    Couch 
we awhile, and mark.
                                         [Retires with Horatio.]

  Laer. Wh
at ceremony else?
  Ham. That is Laertes,
    A very noble youth. Mark.
  Laer. What ceremony els
e?
  Priest. Her obsequies have been as far enlarg'd
    As we have warranty. Her death was doubtf
ul;
    And, but that great command o'ersways the order,
    She should in ground unsanctified hav
e lodg'd
    Till the last trumpet. For charitable prayers,
    Shards, flints, and pebbles should
 be thrown on her.
    Yet here she is allow'd her virgin rites,
    Her maiden strewments, and th
e bringing home
    Of bell and burial.
  Laer. Must there no more be done?
  Priest. No more be 
done.
    We should profane the service of the dead
    To sing a requiem and such rest to her
  
  As to peace-parted souls.
  Laer. Lay her i' th' earth;
    And from her fair and unpolluted fle
sh
    May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,
    A minist'ring angel shall my sister b
e
    When thou liest howling.
  Ham. What, the fair Ophelia?
  Queen. Sweets to the sweet! Farew
ell.
                                             [Scatters flowers.]
    I hop'd thou shouldst ha
ve been my Hamlet's wife;
    I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
    And not have
 strew'd thy grave.
  Laer. O, treble woe
    Fall ten times treble on that cursed head
    Whose
 wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
    Depriv'd thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,
    Till I 
have caught her once more in mine arms.
                                             Leaps in the g
rave.
    Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead
    Till of this flat a mountain you have mad
e
    T' o'ertop old Pelion or the skyish head
    Of blue Olympus.
  Ham. [comes forward] What i
s he whose grief
    Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow
    Conjures the wand'ring sta
rs, and makes them stand
    Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,
    Hamlet the Dane.         
           [Leaps in after Laertes.
  Laer. The devil take thy soul!
                             
               [Grapples with him].
  Ham. Thou pray'st not well.
    I prithee take thy fingers f
rom my throat;
    For, though I am not splenitive and rash,
    Yet have I in me something danger
ous,
    Which let thy wisdom fear. Hold off thy hand!
  King. Pluck them asunder.
  Queen. Hamle
t, Hamlet!
  All. Gentlemen!
  Hor. Good my lord, be quiet.
             [The Attendants part the
m, and they come out of the
                                                         grave.]
  Ham
. Why, I will fight with him upon this theme
    Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
  Queen. O m
y son, what theme?
  Ham. I lov'd Ophelia. Forty thousand brothers
    Could not (with all their q
uantity of love)
    Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?
  King. O, he is mad, Laertes.
  
Queen. For love of God, forbear him!
  Ham. 'Swounds, show me what thou't do.
    Woo't weep? woo'
t fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?
    Woo't drink up esill? eat a crocodile?
    I'll do't.
 Dost thou come here to whine?
    To outface me with leaping in her grave?
    Be buried quick wi
th her, and so will I.
    And if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
    Millions of acres on
 us, till our ground,
    Singeing his pate against the burning zone,
    Make Ossa like a wart! N
ay, an thou'lt mouth,
    I'll rant as well as thou.
  Queen. This is mere madness;
    And thus 
a while the fit will work on him.
    Anon, as patient as the female dove
    When that her golden
 couplets are disclos'd,
    His silence will sit drooping.
  Ham. Hear you, sir!
    What is the
 reason that you use me thus?
    I lov'd you ever. But it is no matter.
    Let Hercules himself 
do what he may,
    The cat will mew, and dog will have his day.
Exit.
  King. I pray thee, good 
Horatio, wait upon him.
                                                   Exit Horatio.
    [To L
aertes] Strengthen your patience in our last night's
speech.
    We'll put the matter to the prese
nt push.-
    Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.-
    This grave shall have a living mon
ument.
    An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
    Till then in patience our proceeding be.
  
                                                       Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A hall 
in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet and Horatio.

  Ham. So much for this, sir; now shall you see the o
ther.
    You do remember all the circumstance?
  Hor. Remember it, my lord!
  Ham. Sir, in my he
art there was a kind of fighting
    That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay
    Worse than t
he mutinies in the bilboes. Rashly-
    And prais'd be rashness for it; let us know,
    Our indis
cretion sometime serves us well
    When our deep plots do pall; and that should learn us
    Ther
e's a divinity that shapes our ends,
    Rough-hew them how we will-
  Hor. That is most certain.

  Ham. Up from my cabin,
    My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
    Grop'd I to find out t
hem; had my desire,
    Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew
    To mine own room again; ma
king so bold
    (My fears forgetting manners) to unseal
    Their grand commission; where I found
, Horatio
    (O royal knavery!), an exact command,
    Larded with many several sorts of reasons,

    Importing Denmark's health, and England's too,
    With, hoo! such bugs and goblins in my lif
e-
    That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
    No, not to stay the finding of the axe,
    
My head should be struck off.
  Hor. Is't possible?
  Ham. Here's the commission; read it at more 
leisure.
    But wilt thou bear me how I did proceed?
  Hor. I beseech you.
  Ham. Being thus ben
etted round with villanies,
    Or I could make a prologue to my brains,
    They had begun the pl
ay. I sat me down;
    Devis'd a new commission; wrote it fair.
    I once did hold it, as our sta
tists do,
    A baseness to write fair, and labour'd much
    How to forget that learning; but, si
r, now
    It did me yeoman's service. Wilt thou know
    Th' effect of what I wrote?
  Hor. Ay, 
good my lord.
  Ham. An earnest conjuration from the King,
    As England was his faithful tributa
ry,
    As love between them like the palm might flourish,
    As peace should still her wheaten g
arland wear
    And stand a comma 'tween their amities,
    And many such-like as's of great charg
e,
    That, on the view and knowing of these contents,
    Without debatement further, more or le
ss,
    He should the bearers put to sudden death,
    Not shriving time allow'd.
  Hor. How was 
this seal'd?
  Ham. Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
    I had my father's signet in my purs
e,
    Which was the model of that Danish seal;
    Folded the writ up in the form of th' other,

    Subscrib'd it, gave't th' impression, plac'd it safely,
    The changeling never known. Now, th
e next day
    Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent
    Thou know'st already.
  Hor. S
o Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.
  Ham. Why, man, they did make love to this employment!
  
  They are not near my conscience; their defeat
    Does by their own insinuation grow.
    'Tis d
angerous when the baser nature comes
    Between the pass and fell incensed points
    Of mighty o
pposites.
  Hor. Why, what a king is this!
  Ham. Does it not, thinks't thee, stand me now upon-

    He that hath kill'd my king, and whor'd my mother;
    Popp'd in between th' election and my ho
pes;
    Thrown out his angle for my proper life,
    And with such coz'nage- is't not perfect con
science
    To quit him with this arm? And is't not to be damn'd
    To let this canker of our nat
ure come
    In further evil?
  Hor. It must be shortly known to him from England
    What is the
 issue of the business there.
  Ham. It will be short; the interim is mine,
    And a man's life i
s no more than to say 'one.'
    But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
    That to Laertes I forgot m
yself,
    For by the image of my cause I see
    The portraiture of his. I'll court his favours.

    But sure the bravery of his grief did put me
    Into a tow'ring passion.
  Hor. Peace! Who c
omes here?

                 Enter young Osric, a courtier.

  Osr. Your lordship is right welco
me back to Denmark.
  Ham. I humbly thank you, sir. [Aside to Horatio] Dost know this
    waterfly
?
  Hor. [aside to Hamlet] No, my good lord.
  Ham. [aside to Horatio] Thy state is the more graci
ous; for
'tis a
    vice to know him. He hath much land, and fertile. Let a beast
be
    lord of
 beasts, and his crib shall stand at the king's mess.
'Tis
    a chough; but, as I say, spacious i
n the possession of dirt.

  Osr. Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should
impart

    a thing to you from his Majesty.
  Ham. I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit. P
ut
your
    bonnet to his right use. 'Tis for the head.
  Osr. I thank your lordship, it is very 
hot.
  Ham. No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly.
  Osr. It is indifferent cold, 
my lord, indeed.
  Ham. But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my
complexion.
  Osr. Exce
edingly, my lord; it is very sultry, as 'twere- I
cannot
    tell how. But, my lord, his Majesty b
ade me signify to you
that
    he has laid a great wager on your head. Sir, this is the
matter-

  Ham. I beseech you remember.
                           [Hamlet moves him to put on his hat.]
  
Osr. Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here
is
    newly come to court Laertes
; believe me, an absolute
gentleman,
    full of most excellent differences, of very soft society 
and
    great showing. Indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the
card
    or calendar of gentr
y; for you shall find in him the
continent of
    what part a gentleman would see.
  Ham. Sir, hi
s definement suffers no perdition in you; though, I

    know, to divide him inventorially would d
ozy th' arithmetic
of
    memory, and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail.
    But, 
in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of
great
    article, and his infusion of such
 dearth and rareness as, to
make
    true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror, and who
el
se
    would trace him, his umbrage, nothing more.
  Osr. Your lordship speaks most infallibly of 
him.
  Ham. The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our
more
    rawer breath?
  O
sr. Sir?
  Hor [aside to Hamlet] Is't not possible to understand in
another
    tongue? You will 
do't, sir, really.
  Ham. What imports the nomination of this gentleman?
  Osr. Of Laertes?
  Hor
. [aside] His purse is empty already. All's golden words are
    spent.
  Ham. Of him, sir.
  Osr
. I know you are not ignorant-
  Ham. I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would
no
t
    much approve me. Well, sir?
  Osr. You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is-
  Ha
m. I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in
    excellence; but to know a man wel
l were to know himself.
  Osr. I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on
him
   
 by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.
  Ham. What's his weapon?
  Osr. Rapier and dagger.
  Ham.
 That's two of his weapons- but well.
  Osr. The King, sir, hath wager'd with him six Barbary horse
s;
    against the which he has impon'd, as I take it, six French
    rapiers and poniards, with t
heir assigns, as girdle, hangers,
and
    so. Three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to f
ancy,
    very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of
    very liberal conceit.

  Ham. What call you the carriages?
  Hor. [aside to Hamlet] I knew you must be edified by the
ma
rgent
    ere you had done.
  Osr. The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
  Ham. The phrase would b
e more germane to the matter if we could
    carry cannon by our sides. I would it might be hangers
 till
then.
    But on! Six Barbary horses against six French swords, their
    assigns, and thre
e liberal-conceited carriages: that's the
French
    bet against the Danish. Why is this all impon
'd, as you call
it?
  Osr. The King, sir, hath laid that, in a dozen passes between
    yourself 
and him, he shall not exceed you three hits; he hath
    laid on twelve for nine, and it would come
 to immediate trial
    if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.
  Ham. How if I answer no?
 
 Osr. I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
  Ham. Sir, I will walk here in the 
hall. If it please his
Majesty,
    it is the breathing time of day with me. Let the foils be
   
 brought, the gentleman willing, and the King hold his
purpose,
    I will win for him if I can; i
f not, I will gain nothing but
my
    shame and the odd hits.
  Osr. Shall I redeliver you e'en s
o?
  Ham. To this effect, sir, after what flourish your nature will.
  Osr. I commend my duty to y
our lordship.
  Ham. Yours, yours. [Exit Osric.] He does well to commend it
    himself; there are
 no tongues else for's turn.
  Hor. This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.
  Ham. He d
id comply with his dug before he suck'd it. Thus has
he,
    and many more of the same bevy that I
 know the drossy age
dotes
    on, only got the tune of the time and outward habit of
encounter-

    a kind of yesty collection, which carries them through and
    through the most fann'd and win
nowed opinions; and do but
blow
    them to their trial-the bubbles are out,

                  
          Enter a Lord.

  Lord. My lord, his Majesty commended him to you by young Osric,
who
 
   brings back to him, that you attend him in the hall. He sends
to
    know if your pleasure hold
 to play with Laertes, or that you
will
    take longer time.
  Ham. I am constant to my purposes
; they follow the King's
pleasure.
    If his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or whensoever,
p
rovided
    I be so able as now.
  Lord. The King and Queen and all are coming down.
  Ham. In ha
ppy time.
  Lord. The Queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to
    Laertes before you
 fall to play.
  Ham. She well instructs me.
                                                    [
Exit Lord.]
  Hor. You will lose this wager, my lord.
  Ham. I do not think so. Since he went into
 France I have been
in
    continual practice. I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst
not
   
 think how ill all's here about my heart. But it is no matter.
  Hor. Nay, good my lord -
  Ham. I
t is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gaingiving as
    would perhaps trouble a woman.
  Hor.
 If your mind dislike anything, obey it. I will forestall
their
    repair hither and say you are 
not fit.
  Ham. Not a whit, we defy augury; there's a special providence
in
    the fall of a spa
rrow. If it be now, 'tis not to come; if it
be
    not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, 
yet it will
come:
    the readiness is all. Since no man knows aught of what he
leaves,
    what
 is't to leave betimes? Let be.

    Enter King, Queen, Laertes, Osric, and Lords, with other
   
           Attendants with foils and gauntlets.
               A table and flagons of wine on it.


  King. Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
                    [The King puts Laerte
s' hand into Hamlet's.]
  Ham. Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong;
    But pardon't, 
as you are a gentleman.
    This presence knows,
    And you must needs have heard, how I am punis
h'd
    With sore distraction. What I have done
    That might your nature, honour, and exception

    Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
    Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet.
 
   If Hamlet from himself be taken away,
    And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
    The
n Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
    Who does it, then? His madness. If't be so,
    Hamlet
 is of the faction that is wrong'd;
    His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
    Sir, in this audie
nce,
    Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd evil
    Free me so far in your most generous thoughts

    That I have shot my arrow o'er the house
    And hurt my brother.
  Laer. I am satisfied in 
nature,
    Whose motive in this case should stir me most
    To my revenge. But in my terms of ho
nour
    I stand aloof, and will no reconcilement
    Till by some elder masters of known honour

    I have a voice and precedent of peace
    To keep my name ungor'd. But till that time
    I do
 receive your offer'd love like love,
    And will not wrong it.
  Ham. I embrace it freely,
    
And will this brother's wager frankly play.
    Give us the foils. Come on.
  Laer. Come, one for 
me.
  Ham. I'll be your foil, Laertes. In mine ignorance
    Your skill shall, like a star i' th' 
darkest night,
    Stick fiery off indeed.
  Laer. You mock me, sir.
  Ham. No, by this hand.
  
King. Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
    You know the wager?
  Ham. Very well, m
y lord.
    Your Grace has laid the odds o' th' weaker side.
  King. I do not fear it, I have seen
 you both;
    But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.
  Laer. This is too heavy; let me
 see another.
  Ham. This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
                          
                      Prepare to play.
  Osr. Ay, my good lord.
  King. Set me the stoups of wine 
upon that table.
    If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
    Or quit in answer of the third ex
change,
    Let all the battlements their ordnance fire;
    The King shall drink to Hamlet's bett
er breath,
    And in the cup an union shall he throw
    Richer than that which four successive k
ings
    In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;
    And let the kettle to the trumpet spe
ak,
    The trumpet to the cannoneer without,
    The cannons to the heavens, the heaven to earth,

    'Now the King drinks to Hamlet.' Come, begin.
    And you the judges, bear a wary eye.
  Ham
. Come on, sir.
  Laer. Come, my lord.                                They play.
  Ham. One.
  La
er. No.
  Ham. Judgment!
  Osr. A hit, a very palpable hit.
  Laer. Well, again!
  King. Stay, g
ive me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
    Here's to thy health.
               [Drum; trumpet
s sound; a piece goes off [within].
    Give him the cup.
  Ham. I'll play this bout first; set it
 by awhile.
    Come. (They play.) Another hit. What say you?
  Laer. A touch, a touch; I do confe
ss't.
  King. Our son shall win.
  Queen. He's fat, and scant of breath.
    Here, Hamlet, take m
y napkin, rub thy brows.
    The Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
  Ham. Good madam!
  King
. Gertrude, do not drink.
  Queen. I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.          Drinks.
  King.
 [aside] It is the poison'd cup; it is too late.
  Ham. I dare not drink yet, madam; by-and-by.
  
Queen. Come, let me wipe thy face.
  Laer. My lord, I'll hit him now.
  King. I do not think't.
 
 Laer. [aside] And yet it is almost against my conscience.
  Ham. Come for the third, Laertes! You 
but dally.
    Pray you pass with your best violence;
    I am afeard you make a wanton of me.
  
Laer. Say you so? Come on.                               Play.
  Osr. Nothing neither way.
  Laer.
 Have at you now!
                [Laertes wounds Hamlet; then] in scuffling, they
               
     change rapiers, [and Hamlet wounds Laertes].
  King. Part them! They are incens'd.
  Ham. Nay
 come! again!                         The Queen falls.

  Osr. Look to the Queen there, ho!
  Hor
. They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?
  Osr. How is't, Laertes?
  Laer. Why, as a woodco
ck to mine own springe, Osric.
    I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.
  Ham. How does the
 Queen?
  King. She sounds to see them bleed.
  Queen. No, no! the drink, the drink! O my dear Ham
let!
    The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.                 [Dies.]
  Ham. O villany! Ho! let th
e door be lock'd.
    Treachery! Seek it out.
                                                [Lae
rtes falls.]
  Laer. It is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain;
    No medicine in the world can 
do thee good.
    In thee there is not half an hour of life.
    The treacherous instrument is in 
thy hand,
    Unbated and envenom'd. The foul practice
    Hath turn'd itself on me. Lo, here I li
e,
    Never to rise again. Thy mother's poison'd.
    I can no more. The King, the King's to blam
e.
  Ham. The point envenom'd too?
    Then, venom, to thy work.                    Hurts the King
.
  All. Treason! treason!
  King. O, yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt.
  Ham. Here, thou in
cestuous, murd'rous, damned Dane,
    Drink off this potion! Is thy union here?
    Follow my moth
er.                                 King dies.
  Laer. He is justly serv'd.
    It is a poison tem
per'd by himself.
    Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet.
    Mine and my father's death c
ome not upon thee,
    Nor thine on me!                                       Dies.
  Ham. Heaven 
make thee free of it! I follow thee.
    I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!
    You that l
ook pale and tremble at this chance,
    That are but mutes or audience to this act,
    Had I but
 time (as this fell sergeant, Death,
    Is strict in his arrest) O, I could tell you-
    But let
 it be. Horatio, I am dead;
    Thou liv'st; report me and my cause aright
    To the unsatisfied.

  Hor. Never believe it.
    I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.
    Here's yet some liquor 
left.
  Ham. As th'art a man,
    Give me the cup. Let go! By heaven, I'll ha't.
    O good Horat
io, what a wounded name
    (Things standing thus unknown) shall live behind me!
    If thou didst
 ever hold me in thy heart,
    Absent thee from felicity awhile,
    And in this harsh world draw
 thy breath in pain,
    To tell my story.         [March afar off, and shot within.]
    What war
like noise is this?
  Osr. Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
    To the ambassador
s of England gives
    This warlike volley.
  Ham. O, I die, Horatio!
    The potent poison quite
 o'ercrows my spirit.
    I cannot live to hear the news from England,
    But I do prophesy th' e
lection lights
    On Fortinbras. He has my dying voice.
    So tell him, with th' occurrents, mor
e and less,
    Which have solicited- the rest is silence.             Dies.
  Hor. Now cracks a n
oble heart. Good night, sweet prince,
    And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
           
                                      [March within.]
    Why does the drum come hither?

    Ent
er Fortinbras and English Ambassadors, with Drum,
                  Colours, and Attendants.

  F
ort. Where is this sight?
  Hor. What is it you will see?
    If aught of woe or wonder, cease you
r search.
  Fort. This quarry cries on havoc. O proud Death,
    What feast is toward in thine ete
rnal cell
    That thou so many princes at a shot
    So bloodily hast struck.
  Ambassador. The 
sight is dismal;
    And our affairs from England come too late.
    The ears are senseless that s
hould give us hearing
    To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd
    That Rosencrantz and Guilde
nstern are dead.
    Where should we have our thanks?
  Hor. Not from his mouth,
    Had it th' a
bility of life to thank you.
    He never gave commandment for their death.
    But since, so jump
 upon this bloody question,
    You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
    Are here arriv
'd, give order that these bodies
    High on a stage be placed to the view;
    And let me speak t
o the yet unknowing world
    How these things came about. So shall you hear
    Of carnal, bloody
 and unnatural acts;
    Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters;
    Of deaths put on by cunni
ng and forc'd cause;
    And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
    Fall'n on th' inventors' heads.
 All this can I
    Truly deliver.
  Fort. Let us haste to hear it,
    And call the noblest to t
he audience.
    For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.
    I have some rights of memory in thi
s kingdom
    Which now, to claim my vantage doth invite me.
  Hor. Of that I shall have also caus
e to speak,
    And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more.
    But let this same be present
ly perform'd,
    Even while men's minds are wild, lest more mischance
    On plots and errors hap
pen.
  Fort. Let four captains
    Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage;
    For he was likely
, had he been put on,
    To have prov'd most royally; and for his passage
    The soldiers' music
 and the rites of war
    Speak loudly for him.
    Take up the bodies. Such a sight as this
    
Becomes the field but here shows much amiss.
    Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
            Exeunt ma
rching; after the which a peal of ordnance
                                                   are s
hot off.

ACT I. Scene I.
Elsinore. A platf
orm before the Castle.

Enter two Sentinels-[first,] Francisco, [who paces up and down
at his pos
t; then] Bernardo, [who approaches him].

  Ber. Who's there?
  Fran. Nay, answer me. Stand and u
nfold yourself.
  Ber. Long live the King!
  Fran. Bernardo?
  Ber. He.
  Fran. You come most ca
refully upon your hour.
  Ber. 'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.
  Fran. For thi
s relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold,
    And I am sick at heart.
  Ber. Have you had quiet guar
d?
  Fran. Not a mouse stirring.
  Ber. Well, good night.
    If you do meet Horatio and Marcellu
s,
    The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.

                    Enter Horatio and Marcel
lus.

  Fran. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?
  Hor. Friends to this ground.
  Mar
. And liegemen to the Dane.
  Fran. Give you good night.
  Mar. O, farewell, honest soldier.
    
Who hath reliev'd you?
  Fran. Bernardo hath my place.
    Give you good night.                   
                Exit.
  Mar. Holla, Bernardo!
  Ber. Say-
    What, is Horatio there ?
  Hor. A 
piece of him.
  Ber. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.
  Mar. What, has this thing appear
'd again to-night?
  Ber. I have seen nothing.
  Mar. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
    And 
will not let belief take hold of him
    Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.
    Theref
ore I have entreated him along,
    With us to watch the minutes of this night,
    That, if a
