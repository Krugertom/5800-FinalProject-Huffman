Elsinore. A platform before the Castle.

Enter two Sentinels-[first,] Franc
isco, [who paces up and down
at his post; then] Bernardo, [who approaches him].

  Ber. Who's the
re?
  Fran. Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.
  Ber. Long live the King!
  Fran. Bernard
o?
  Ber. He.
  Fran. You come most carefully upon your hour.
  Ber. 'Tis now struck twelve. Get 
thee to bed, Francisco.
  Fran. For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold,
    And I am sick a
t heart.
  Ber. Have you had quiet guard?
  Fran. Not a mouse stirring.
  Ber. Well, good night.

    If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
    The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.

    
                Enter Horatio and Marcellus.

  Fran. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there
?
  Hor. Friends to this ground.
  Mar. And liegemen to the Dane.
  Fran. Give you good night.
 
 Mar. O, farewell, honest soldier.
    Who hath reliev'd you?
  Fran. Bernardo hath my place.
   
 Give you good night.                                   Exit.
  Mar. Holla, Bernardo!
  Ber. Say-

    What, is Horatio there ?
  Hor. A piece of him.
  Ber. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcel
lus.
  Mar. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
  Ber. I have seen nothing.
  Mar. Hora
tio says 'tis but our fantasy,
    And will not let belief take hold of him
    Touching this drea
ded sight, twice seen of us.
    Therefore I have entreated him along,
    With us to watch the mi
nutes of this night,
    That, if again this apparition come,
    He may approve our eyes and spea
k to it.
  Hor. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
  Ber. Sit down awhile,
    And let us once again 
assail your ears,
    That are so fortified against our story,
    What we two nights have seen.

  Hor. Well, sit we down,
    And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
  Ber. Last night of all,
 
   When yond same star that's westward from the pole
    Had made his course t' illume that part of
 heaven
    Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
    The bell then beating one-

          
              Enter Ghost.

  Mar. Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!
  Ber. In th
e same figure, like the King that's dead.
  Mar. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
  Ber. 
Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.
  Hor. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.

  Ber. It would be spoke to.
  Mar. Question it, Horatio.
  Hor. What art thou that usurp'st thi
s time of night
    Together with that fair and warlike form
    In which the majesty of buried De
nmark
    Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!
  Mar. It is offended.
  Ber. See, 
it stalks away!
  Hor. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!
                                  
                   Exit Ghost.
  Mar. 'Tis gone and will not answer.
  Ber. How now, Horatio? You 
tremble and look pale.
    Is not this something more than fantasy?
    What think you on't?
  Ho
r. Before my God, I might not this believe
    Without the sensible and true avouch
    Of mine ow
n eyes.
  Mar. Is it not like the King?
  Hor. As thou art to thyself.
    Such was the very armo
ur he had on
    When he th' ambitious Norway combated.
    So frown'd he once when, in an angry p
arle,
    He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
    'Tis strange.
  Mar. Thus twice before, an
d jump at this dead hour,
    With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
  Hor. In what particu
lar thought to work I know not;
    But, in the gross and scope of my opinion,
    This bodes some
 strange eruption to our state.
  Mar. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows,
    Why this
 same strict and most observant watch
    So nightly toils the subject of the land,
    And why su
ch daily cast of brazen cannon
    And foreign mart for implements of war;
    Why such impress of
 shipwrights, whose sore task
    Does not divide the Sunday from the week.
    What might be towa
rd, that this sweaty haste
    Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day?
    Who is't that 
can inform me?
  Hor. That can I.
    At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
    Whose ima
ge even but now appear'd to us,
    Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
    Thereto prick'd
 on by a most emulate pride,
    Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet
    (For so this
 side of our known world esteem'd him)
    Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,
   
 Well ratified by law and heraldry,
    Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
    Which 
he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror;
    Against the which a moiety competent
    Was gaged by ou
r king; which had return'd
    To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
    Had he been vanquisher, as, b
y the same cov'nant
    And carriage of the article design'd,
    His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, yo
ung Fortinbras,
    Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
    Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and 
there,
    Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
    For food and diet, to some enterprise
    
That hath a stomach in't; which is no other,
    As it doth well appear unto our state,
    But to
 recover of us, by strong hand
    And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
    So by his fath
er lost; and this, I take it,
    Is the main motive of our preparations,
    The source of this o
ur watch, and the chief head
    Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
  Ber. I think it be n
o other but e'en so.
    Well may it sort that this portentous figure
    Comes armed through our 
watch, so like the King
    That was and is the question of these wars.
  Hor. A mote it is to tro
uble the mind's eye.
    In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
    A little ere the mightiest 
Julius fell,
    The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead
    Did squeak and gibber in th
e Roman streets;
    As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood,
    Disasters in the sun; an
d the moist star
    Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
    Was sick almost to doomsday 
with eclipse.
    And even the like precurse of fierce events,
    As harbingers preceding still t
he fates
    And prologue to the omen coming on,
    Have heaven and earth together demonstrated

    Unto our climature and countrymen.

                      Enter Ghost again.

    But soft! 
behold! Lo, where it comes again!
    I'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!
         
                                      Spreads his arms.
    If thou hast any sound, or use of voice
,
    Speak to me.
    If there be any good thing to be done,
    That may to thee do ease, and, 
race to me,
    Speak to me.
    If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
    Which happily forek
nowing may avoid,
    O, speak!
    Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
    Extorted treasure i
n the womb of earth
    (For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death),
                    
                             The cock crows.
    Speak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!

  Mar. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
  Hor. Do, if it will not stand.
  Ber. 'Tis here!

  Hor. 'Tis here!
  Mar. 'Tis gone!
                                                     Exit Gh
ost.
    We do it wrong, being so majestical,
    To offer it the show of violence;
    For it is
 as the air, invulnerable,
    And our vain blows malicious mockery.
  Ber. It was about to speak,
 when the cock crew.
  Hor. And then it started, like a guilty thing
    Upon a fearful summons. I
 have heard
    The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
    Doth with his lofty and shrill-soun
ding throat
    Awake the god of day; and at his warning,
    Whether in sea or fire, in earth or 
air,
    Th' extravagant and erring spirit hies
    To his confine; and of the truth herein
    T
his present object made probation.
  Mar. It faded on the crowing of the cock.
    Some say that e
ver, 'gainst that season comes
    Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
    The bird of dawn
ing singeth all night long;
    And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,
    The nights are
 wholesome, then no planets strike,
    No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
    So hall
ow'd and so gracious is the time.
  Hor. So have I heard and do in part believe it.
    But look, 
the morn, in russet mantle clad,
    Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.
    Break we ou
r watch up; and by my advice
    Let us impart what we have seen to-night
    Unto young Hamlet; f
or, upon my life,
    This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
    Do you consent we shall acqu
aint him with it,
    As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
    Let's do't, I pray; and I thi
s morning know
    Where we shall find him most conveniently.           Exeunt.




Scene II.

Elsinore. A room of state in the Castle.

Flourish. [Enter Claudius, King of Denmark, Gertrude th
e Queen,
Hamlet,
Polonius, Laertes and his sister Ophelia, [Voltemand, Cornelius,]
Lords Attendan
t.

  King. Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
    The memory be green, and that it us
 befitted
    To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom
    To be contracted in one brow 
of woe,
    Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
    That we with wisest sorrow think on 
him
    Together with remembrance of ourselves.
    Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,

    Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,
    Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,
   
 With an auspicious, and a dropping eye,
    With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,
  
  In equal scale weighing delight and dole,
    Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd
    Your 
better wisdoms, which have freely gone
    With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
    Now fo
llows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
    Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
    Or thinking 
by our late dear brother's death
    Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
    Colleagued wit
h this dream of his advantage,
    He hath not fail'd to pester us with message
    Importing the 
surrender of those lands
    Lost by his father, with all bands of law,
    To our most valiant br
other. So much for him.
    Now for ourself and for this time of meeting.
    Thus much the busine
ss is: we have here writ
    To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,
    Who, impotent and bedrid, s
carcely hears
    Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress
    His further gait herein, in that t
he levies,
    The lists, and full proportions are all made
    Out of his subject; and we here di
spatch
    You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,
    For bearers of this greeting to old Norway
,
    Giving to you no further personal power
    To business with the King, more than the scope

    Of these dilated articles allow.            [Gives a paper.]
    Farewell, and let your haste c
ommend your duty.
  Cor., Volt. In that, and all things, will we show our duty.
  King. We doubt i
t nothing. Heartily farewell.
                                 Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius.
   
 And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
    You told us of some suit. What is't, Laertes?
   
 You cannot speak of reason to the Dane
    And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
 
   That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
    The head is not more native to the heart,
    T
he hand more instrumental to the mouth,
    Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
    What 
wouldst thou have, Laertes?
  Laer. My dread lord,
    Your leave and favour to return to France;

    From whence though willingly I came to Denmark
    To show my duty in your coronation,
    Ye
t now I must confess, that duty done,
    My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
    And 
bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
  King. Have you your father's leave? What says Poloniu
s?
  Pol. He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
    By laboursome petition, and at last
 
   Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent.
    I do beseech you give him leave to go.
  King. Take
 thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,
    And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
    But now,
 my cousin Hamlet, and my son-
  Ham. [aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind!
  King. 
How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
  Ham. Not so, my lord. I am too much i' th' sun.
  Q
ueen. Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
    And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark
.
    Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
    Seek for thy noble father in the dust.
    Thou kn
ow'st 'tis common. All that lives must die,
    Passing through nature to eternity.
  Ham. Ay, mad
am, it is common.
  Queen. If it be,
    Why seems it so particular with thee?
  Ham. Seems, mada
m, Nay, it is. I know not 'seems.'
    'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
    Nor customar
y suits of solemn black,
    Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,
    No, nor the fruitful rive
r in the eye,
    Nor the dejected havior of the visage,
    Together with all forms, moods, shape
s of grief,
    'That can denote me truly. These indeed seem,
    For they are actions that a man 
might play;
    But I have that within which passeth show-
    These but the trappings and the sui
ts of woe.
  King. 'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
    To give these mourning d
uties to your father;
    But you must know, your father lost a father;
    That father lost, lost
 his, and the survivor bound
    In filial obligation for some term
    To do obsequious sorrow. B
ut to persever
    In obstinate condolement is a course
    Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly 
grief;
    It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
    A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
 
   An understanding simple and unschool'd;
    For what we know must be, and is as common
    As a
ny the most vulgar thing to sense,
    Why should we in our peevish opposition
    Take it to hear
t? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
    A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
    To reason mos
t absurd, whose common theme
    Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
    From the first
 corse till he that died to-day,
    'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth
    This unprev
ailing woe, and think of us
    As of a father; for let the world take note
    You are the most i
mmediate to our throne,
    And with no less nobility of love
    Than that which dearest father b
ears his son
    Do I impart toward you. For your intent
    In going back to school in Wittenberg
,
    It is most retrograde to our desire;
    And we beseech you, bend you to remain
    Here in
 the cheer and comfort of our eye,
    Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
  Queen. Let no
t thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.
    I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.
  Ham. 
I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
  King. Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.
    Be as our
self in Denmark. Madam, come.
    This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet
    Sits smiling to my
 heart; in grace whereof,
    No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day
    But the great cannon
 to the clouds shall tell,
    And the King's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,
    Respeaking e
arthly thunder. Come away.
                                Flourish. Exeunt all but Hamlet.
  Ham.
 O that this too too solid flesh would melt,
    Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!
    Or that 
the Everlasting had not fix'd
    His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
    How weary, sta
le, flat, and unprofitable
    Seem to me all the uses of this world!
    Fie on't! ah, fie! 'Tis 
an unweeded garden
    That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
    Possess it merely. 
That it should come to this!
    But two months dead! Nay, not so much, not two.
    So excellent 
a king, that was to this
    Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
    That he might not bet
eem the winds of heaven
    Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
    Must I remember? Why
, she would hang on him
    As if increase of appetite had grown
    By what it fed on; and yet, w
ithin a month-
    Let me not think on't! Frailty, thy name is woman!-
    A little month, or ere 
those shoes were old
    With which she followed my poor father's body
    Like Niobe, all tears- 
why she, even she
    (O God! a beast that wants discourse of reason
    Would have mourn'd longer
) married with my uncle;
    My father's brother, but no more like my father
    Than I to Hercule
s. Within a month,
    Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
    Had left the flushing in her
 galled eyes,
    She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
    With such dexterity to incestuous
 sheets!
    It is not, nor it cannot come to good.
    But break my heart, for I must hold my ton
gue!

          Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo.

  Hor. Hail to your lordship!
  Ham. I
 am glad to see you well.
    Horatio!- or I do forget myself.
  Hor. The same, my lord, and your 
poor servant ever.
  Ham. Sir, my good friend- I'll change that name with you.
    And what make y
ou from Wittenberg, Horatio?
    Marcellus?
  Mar. My good lord!
  Ham. I am very glad to see you
.- [To Bernardo] Good even, sir.-

    But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
  Hor. A tru
ant disposition, good my lord.
  Ham. I would not hear your enemy say so,
    Nor shall you do my 
ear that violence
    To make it truster of your own report
    Against yourself. I know you are n
o truant.
    But what is your affair in Elsinore?
    We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depar
t.
  Hor. My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
  Ham. I prithee do not mock me, fellow st
udent.
    I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
  Hor. Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upo
n.
  Ham. Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats
    Did coldly furnish forth the marria
ge tables.
    Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
    Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!

    My father- methinks I see my father.
  Hor. O, where, my lord?
  Ham. In my mind's eye, Horat
io.
  Hor. I saw him once. He was a goodly king.
  Ham. He was a man, take him for all in all.
  
  I shall not look upon his like again.
  Hor. My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
  Ham. Saw?
 who?
  Hor. My lord, the King your father.
  Ham. The King my father?
  Hor. Season your admirat
ion for a while
    With an attent ear, till I may deliver
    Upon the witness of these gentlemen
,
    This marvel to you.
  Ham. For God's love let me hear!
  Hor. Two nights together had these
 gentlemen
    (Marcellus and Bernardo) on their watch
    In the dead vast and middle of the nigh
t
    Been thus encount'red. A figure like your father,
    Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
   
 Appears before them and with solemn march
    Goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walk'd
   
 By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
    Within his truncheon's length; whilst they distill
'd
    Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
    Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
    
In dreadful secrecy impart they did,
    And I with them the third night kept the watch;
    Where
, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
    Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
    Th
e apparition comes. I knew your father.
    These hands are not more like.
  Ham. But where was th
is?
  Mar. My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
  Ham. Did you not speak to it?
  Hor. My
 lord, I did;
    But answer made it none. Yet once methought
    It lifted up it head and did add
ress
    Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
    But even then the morning cock crew loud,

    And at the sound it shrunk in haste away
    And vanish'd from our sight.
  Ham. 'Tis very str
ange.
  Hor. As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
    And we did think it writ down in our d
uty
    To let you know of it.
  Ham. Indeed, indeed, sirs. But this troubles me.
    Hold you th
e watch to-night?
  Both [Mar. and Ber.] We do, my lord.
  Ham. Arm'd, say you?
  Both. Arm'd, my
 lord.
  Ham. From top to toe?
  Both. My lord, from head to foot.
  Ham. Then saw you not his fa
ce?
  Hor. O, yes, my lord! He wore his beaver up.
  Ham. What, look'd he frowningly.
  Hor. A co
untenance more in sorrow than in anger.
  Ham. Pale or red?
  Hor. Nay, very pale.
  Ham. And fix
'd his eyes upon you?
  Hor. Most constantly.
  Ham. I would I had been there.
  Hor. It would ha
ve much amaz'd you.
  Ham. Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
  Hor. While one with moderate ha
ste might tell a hundred.
  Both. Longer, longer.
  Hor. Not when I saw't.
  Ham. His beard was g
rizzled- no?
  Hor. It was, as I have seen it in his life,
    A sable silver'd.
  Ham. I will wa
tch to-night.
    Perchance 'twill walk again.
  Hor. I warr'nt it will.
  Ham. If it assume my n
oble father's person,
    I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
    And bid me hold my 
peace. I pray you all,
    If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
    Let it be tenable in you
r silence still;
    And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
    Give it an understanding but no t
ongue.
    I will requite your loves. So, fare you well.
    Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and 
twelve,
    I'll visit you.
  All. Our duty to your honour.
  Ham. Your loves, as mine to you. Fa
rewell.
                                        Exeunt [all but Hamlet].
    My father's spirit- i
n arms? All is not well.
    I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come!
    Till then sit 
still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,
    Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
Exit

Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius.

Enter Laertes and Ophelia.

 
 Laer. My necessaries are embark'd. Farewell.
    And, sister, as the winds give benefit
    And c
onvoy is assistant, do not sleep,
    But let me hear from you.
  Oph. Do you doubt that?
  Laer.
 For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,
    Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood;
    A viol
et in the youth of primy nature,
    Forward, not permanent- sweet, not lasting;
    The perfume a
nd suppliance of a minute;
    No more.
  Oph. No more but so?
  Laer. Think it no more.
    For
 nature crescent does not grow alone
    In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,
    The inwa
rd service of the mind and soul
    Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
    And now no so
il nor cautel doth besmirch
    The virtue of his will; but you must fear,
    His greatness weigh
'd, his will is not his own;
    For he himself is subject to his birth.
    He may not, as unvalu
ed persons do,
    Carve for himself, for on his choice depends
    The safety and health of this 
whole state,
    And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd
    Unto the voice and yielding of
 that body
    Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
    It fits your wisdom so fa
r to believe it
    As he in his particular act and place
    May give his saying deed; which is n
o further
    Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
    Then weigh what loss your honour may
 sustain
    If with too credent ear you list his songs,
    Or lose your heart, or your chaste tr
easure open
    To his unmast'red importunity.
    Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
   
 And keep you in the rear of your affection,
    Out of the shot and danger of desire.
    The cha
riest maid is prodigal enough
    If she unmask her beauty to the moon.
    Virtue itself scopes n
ot calumnious strokes.
    The canker galls the infants of the spring
    Too oft before their but
tons be disclos'd,
    And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
    Contagious blastments are most 
imminent.
    Be wary then; best safety lies in fear.
    Youth to itself rebels, though none else
 near.
  Oph. I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep
    As watchman to my heart. But, good m
y brother,
    Do not as some ungracious pastors do,
    Show me the steep and thorny way to heave
n,
    Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
    Himself the primrose path of dalliance tr
eads
    And recks not his own rede.
  Laer. O, fear me not!

                       Enter Polon
ius.

    I stay too long. But here my father comes.
    A double blessing is a double grace;
  
  Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
  Pol. Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame!
    Th
e wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
    And you are stay'd for. There- my blessing with thee!

    And these few precepts in thy memory
    Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
 
   Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.
    Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar:
    Those
 friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
    Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel;

    But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
    Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware

    Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,
    Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee.
    G
ive every man thine ear, but few thy voice;
    Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.

    Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
    But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
    F
or the apparel oft proclaims the man,
    And they in France of the best rank and station
    Are 
most select and generous, chief in that.
    Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
    For loan oft 
loses both itself and friend,
    And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
    This above all- t
o thine own self be true,
    And it must follow, as the night the day,
    Thou canst not then be
 false to any man.
    Farewell. My blessing season this in thee!
  Laer. Most humbly do I take my
 leave, my lord.
  Pol. The time invites you. Go, your servants tend.
  Laer. Farewell, Ophelia, a
nd remember well
    What I have said to you.
  Oph. 'Tis in my memory lock'd,
    And you yourse
lf shall keep the key of it.
  Laer. Farewell.                                          Exit.
  Po
l. What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?
  Oph. So please you, something touching the Lord Hamle
t.
  Pol. Marry, well bethought!
    'Tis told me he hath very oft of late
    Given private time
 to you, and you yourself
    Have of your audience been most free and bounteous.
    If it be so-
 as so 'tis put on me,
    And that in way of caution- I must tell you
    You do not understand y
ourself so clearly
    As it behooves my daughter and your honour.
    What is between you? Give m
e up the truth.
  Oph. He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
    Of his affection to me.
  
Pol. Affection? Pooh! You speak like a green girl,
    Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
   
 Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
  Oph. I do not know, my lord, what I should think,

  Pol. Marry, I will teach you! Think yourself a baby
    That you have ta'en these tenders for tr
ue pay,
    Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,
    Or (not to crack the wind of 
the poor phrase,
    Running it thus) you'll tender me a fool.
  Oph. My lord, he hath importun'd 
me with love
    In honourable fashion.
  Pol. Ay, fashion you may call it. Go to, go to!
  Oph. 
And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
    With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
  
Pol. Ay, springes to catch woodcocks! I do know,
    When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
 
   Lends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter,
    Giving more light than heat, extinct in both

    Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
    You must not take for fire. From this time
    
Be something scanter of your maiden presence.
    Set your entreatments at a higher rate
    Than 
a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
    Believe so much in him, that he is young,
    And with a
 larger tether may he walk
    Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia,
    Do not believe his vows
; for they are brokers,
    Not of that dye which their investments show,
    But mere implorators
 of unholy suits,
    Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
    The better to beguile. This i
s for all:
    I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth
    Have you so slander any momen
t leisure
    As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
    Look to't, I charge you. Come you
r ways.
  Oph. I shall obey, my lord.
                                                         Exe
unt.




Scene IV.
Elsinore. The platform before the Castle.

Enter Hamlet, Horatio, and Mar
cellus.

  Ham. The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
  Hor. It is a nipping and an eager air.

  Ham. What hour now?
  Hor. I think it lacks of twelve.
  Mar. No, it is struck.
  Hor. Indeed
? I heard it not. It then draws near the season
    Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
    
               A flourish of trumpets, and two pieces go off.
    What does this mean, my lord?
  
Ham. The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
    Keeps wassail, and the swagg'ring upsprin
g reels,
    And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
    The kettledrum and trumpet thus b
ray out
    The triumph of his pledge.
  Hor. Is it a custom?
  Ham. Ay, marry, is't;
    But to
 my mind, though I am native here
    And to the manner born, it is a custom
    More honour'd in 
the breach than the observance.
    This heavy-headed revel east and west
    Makes us traduc'd an
d tax'd of other nations;
    They clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase
    Soil our addition
; and indeed it takes
    From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
    The pith and marr
ow of our attribute.
    So oft it chances in particular men
    That, for some vicious mole of na
ture in them,
    As in their birth,- wherein they are not guilty,
    Since nature cannot choose 
his origin,-
    By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
    Oft breaking down the pales and forts o
f reason,
    Or by some habit that too much o'erleavens
    The form of plausive manners, that th
ese men
    Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
    Being nature's livery, or fortune's star
,
    Their virtues else- be they as pure as grace,
    As infinite as man may undergo-
    Shall
 in the general censure take corruption
    From that particular fault. The dram of e'il
    Doth 
all the noble substance often dout To his own scandal.

                         Enter Ghost.

 
 Hor. Look, my lord, it comes!
  Ham. Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
    Be thou a spiri
t of health or goblin damn'd,
    Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
    Be thy
 intents wicked or charitable,
    Thou com'st in such a questionable shape
    That I will speak 
to thee. I'll call thee Hamlet,
    King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me?
    Let me not burst i
n ignorance, but tell
    Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,
    Have burst their cerement
s; why the sepulchre
    Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
    Hath op'd his ponderous and marb
le jaws
    To cast thee up again. What may this mean
    That thou, dead corse, again in complete
 steel,
    Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
    Making night hideous, and we fools of natu
re
    So horridly to shake our disposition
    With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
  
  Say, why is this? wherefore? What should we do?
                                           Ghost 
beckons Hamlet.
  Hor. It beckons you to go away with it,
    As if it some impartment did desire

    To you alone.
  Mar. Look with what courteous action
    It waves you to a more removed groun
d.
    But do not go with it!
  Hor. No, by no means!
  Ham. It will not speak. Then will I follo
w it.
  Hor. Do not, my lord!
  Ham. Why, what should be the fear?
    I do not set my life at a 
pin's fee;
    And for my soul, what can it do to that,
    Being a thing immortal as itself?
   
 It waves me forth again. I'll follow it.
  Hor. What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
 
   Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
    That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
    And the
re assume some other, horrible form
    Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
    And dra
w you into madness? Think of it.
    The very place puts toys of desperation,
    Without more mot
ive, into every brain
    That looks so many fadoms to the sea
    And hears it roar beneath.
  H
am. It waves me still.
    Go on. I'll follow thee.
  Mar. You shall not go, my lord.
  Ham. Hold
 off your hands!
  Hor. Be rul'd. You shall not go.
  Ham. My fate cries out
    And makes each p
etty artire in this body
    As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
                                
                [Ghost beckons.]

    Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
    By heaven, I'l
l make a ghost of him that lets me!-
    I say, away!- Go on. I'll follow thee.
                  
                      Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet.
  Hor. He waxes desperate with imagination.
  Mar. 
Let's follow. 'Tis not fit thus to obey him.
  Hor. Have after. To what issue will this come?
  Ma
r. Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
  Hor. Heaven will direct it.
  Mar. Nay, let's fo
llow him.
                                                         Exeunt.




Scene V.
Elsin
ore. The Castle. Another part of the fortifications.

Enter Ghost and Hamlet.

  Ham. Whither wi
lt thou lead me? Speak! I'll go no further.
  Ghost. Mark me.
  Ham. I will.
  Ghost. My hour is 
almost come,
    When I to sulph'rous and tormenting flames
    Must render up myself.
  Ham. Ala
s, poor ghost!
  Ghost. Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
    To what I shall unfold.
  H
am. Speak. I am bound to hear.
  Ghost. So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
  Ham. What?

  Ghost. I am thy father's spirit,
    Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
    And for 
the day confin'd to fast in fires,
    Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
    Are burn
t and purg'd away. But that I am forbid
    To tell the secrets of my prison house,
    I could a 
tale unfold whose lightest word
    Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
    Make thy
 two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
    Thy knotted and combined locks to part,
    A
nd each particular hair to stand on end
    Like quills upon the fretful porcupine.
    But this e
ternal blazon must not be
    To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
    If thou didst e
ver thy dear father love-
  Ham. O God!
  Ghost. Revenge his foul and most unnatural murther.
  H
am. Murther?
  Ghost. Murther most foul, as in the best it is;
    But this most foul, strange, an
d unnatural.
  Ham. Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
    As meditation or the thoug
hts of love,
    May sweep to my revenge.
  Ghost. I find thee apt;
    And duller shouldst thou 
be than the fat weed
    That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
    Wouldst thou not stir in thi
s. Now, Hamlet, hear.
    'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
    A serpent stung me. So 
the whole ear of Denmark
    Is by a forged process of my death
    Rankly abus'd. But know, thou 
noble youth,
    The serpent that did sting thy father's life
    Now wears his crown.
  Ham. O m
y prophetic soul!
    My uncle?
  Ghost. Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
    With wit
chcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts-
    O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
    So 
to seduce!- won to his shameful lust
    The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.
    O Hamlet,
 what a falling-off was there,
    From me, whose love was of that dignity
    That it went hand i
n hand even with the vow
    I made to her in marriage, and to decline
    Upon a wretch whose nat
ural gifts were poor
    To those of mine!
    But virtue, as it never will be mov'd,
    Though 
lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
    So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
    Will sa
te itself in a celestial bed
    And prey on garbage.
    But soft! methinks I scent the morning a
ir.
    Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
    My custom always of the afternoon,
    U
pon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
    With juice of cursed hebona in a vial,
    And in the porc
hes of my ears did pour
    The leperous distilment; whose effect
    Holds such an enmity with bl
ood of man
    That swift as quicksilver it courses through
    The natural gates and alleys of th
e body,
    And with a sudden vigour it doth posset
    And curd, like eager droppings into milk,

    The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine;
    And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
   
 Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust
    All my smooth body.
    Thus was I, sleeping, 
by a brother's hand
    Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd;
    Cut off even in the b
lossoms of my sin,
    Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd,
    No reckoning made, but sent to my a
ccount
    With all my imperfections on my head.
  Ham. O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!

  Ghost. If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.
    Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
    A c
ouch for luxury and damned incest.
    But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
    Taint not thy mi
nd, nor let thy soul contrive
    Against thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven,
    And to those 
thorns that in her bosom lodge
    To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once.
    The glowwor
m shows the matin to be near
    And gins to pale his uneffectual fire.
    Adieu, adieu, adieu! R
emember me.                      Exit.

  Ham. O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?
    
And shall I couple hell? Hold, hold, my heart!
    And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
    B
ut bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?
    Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
    In th
is distracted globe. Remember thee?
    Yea, from the table of my memory
    I'll wipe away all tr
ivial fond records,
    All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past
    That youth and observ
ation copied there,
    And thy commandment all alone shall live
    Within the book and volume of
 my brain,
    Unmix'd with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!
    O most pernicious woman!
    O vill
ain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
    My tables! Meet it is I set it down
    That one may sm
ile, and smile, and be a villain;
    At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark.        [Writes.]

    So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word:
    It is 'Adieu, adieu! Remember me.'
    I have s
worn't.
  Hor. (within) My lord, my lord!

                   Enter Horatio and Marcellus.

  M
ar. Lord Hamlet!
  Hor. Heaven secure him!
  Ham. So be it!
  Mar. Illo, ho, ho, my lord!
  Ham.
 Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.
  Mar. How is't, my noble lord?
  Hor. What news, my lord?

  Mar. O, wonderful!
  Hor. Good my lord, tell it.
  Ham. No, you will reveal it.
  Hor. Not I, 
my lord, by heaven!
  Mar. Nor I, my lord.
  Ham. How say you then? Would heart of man once think 
it?
    But you'll be secret?
  Both. Ay, by heaven, my lord.
  Ham. There's neer a villain dwell
ing in all Denmark
    But he's an arrant knave.
  Hor. There needs no ghost, my lord, come from t
he grave
    To tell us this.
  Ham. Why, right! You are in the right!
    And so, without more c
ircumstance at all,
    I hold it fit that we shake hands and part;
    You, as your business and 
desires shall point you,
    For every man hath business and desire,
    Such as it is; and for my
 own poor part,
    Look you, I'll go pray.
  Hor. These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.

  Ham. I am sorry they offend you, heartily;
    Yes, faith, heartily.
  Hor. There's no offence
, my lord.
  Ham. Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
    And much offence too. Touching
 this vision here,
    It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.
    For your desire to know wh
at is between us,
    O'ermaster't as you may. And now, good friends,
    As you are friends, scho
lars, and soldiers,
    Give me one poor request.
  Hor. What is't, my lord? We will.
  Ham. Neve
r make known what you have seen to-night.
  Both. My lord, we will not.
  Ham. Nay, but swear't.

  Hor. In faith,
    My lord, not I.
  Mar. Nor I, my lord- in faith.
  Ham. Upon my sword.
  Ma
r. We have sworn, my lord, already.
  Ham. Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.

                 Ghost
 cries under the stage.

  Ghost. Swear.
  Ham. Aha boy, say'st thou so? Art thou there, truepenn
y?
    Come on! You hear this fellow in the cellarage.
    Consent to swear.
  Hor. Propose the o
ath, my lord.
  Ham. Never to speak of this that you have seen.
    Swear by my sword.
  Ghost. [
beneath] Swear.
  Ham. Hic et ubique? Then we'll shift our ground.
    Come hither, gentlemen,
  
  And lay your hands again upon my sword.
    Never to speak of this that you have heard:
    Swea
r by my sword.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear by his sword.
  Ham. Well said, old mole! Canst work i' th
' earth so fast?
    A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends."
  Hor. O day and night, but
 this is wondrous strange!
  Ham. And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
    There are more 
things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
    Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
    But come!
   
 Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
    How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself
    (As I 
perchance hereafter shall think meet
    To put an antic disposition on),
    That you, at such ti
mes seeing me, never shall,
    With arms encumb'red thus, or this head-shake,
    Or by pronounci
ng of some doubtful phrase,
    As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'
    Or 'I
f we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'
    Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
  
  That you know aught of me- this is not to do,
    So grace and mercy at your most need help you,

    Swear.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
                                                   [They swe
ar.]
  Ham. Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! So, gentlemen,
    With all my love I do commend me to y
ou;
    And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
    May do t' express his love and friending to you,

    God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;
    And still your fingers on your lips, I 
pray.
    The time is out of joint. O cursed spite
    That ever I was born to set it right!
    
Nay, come, let's go together.
                                                         Exeunt.

Act II. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius.

Enter Polonius and 
Reynaldo.

  Pol. Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
  Rey. I will, my lord.
  Pol. 
You shall do marvell's wisely, good Reynaldo,
    Before You visit him, to make inquire
    Of his
 behaviour.
  Rey. My lord, I did intend it.
  Pol. Marry, well said, very well said. Look you, si
r,
    Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
    And how, and who, what means, and where th
ey keep,
    What company, at what expense; and finding
    By this encompassment and drift of que
stion
    That they do know my son, come you more nearer
    Than your particular demands will tou
ch it.
    Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
    As thus, 'I know his father and
 his friends,
    And in part him.' Do you mark this, Reynaldo?
  Rey. Ay, very well, my lord.
  
Pol. 'And in part him, but,' you may say, 'not well.
    But if't be he I mean, he's very wild
   
 Addicted so and so'; and there put on him
    What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
    
As may dishonour him- take heed of that;
    But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips
    As a
re companions noted and most known
    To youth and liberty.
  Rey. As gaming, my lord.
  Pol. Ay
, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
    Drabbing. You may go so far.
  Rey. My lord, th
at would dishonour him.
  Pol. Faith, no, as you may season it in the charge.
    You must not put
 another scandal on him,
    That he is open to incontinency.
    That's not my meaning. But breat
he his faults so quaintly
    That they may seem the taints of liberty,
    The flash and outbreak
 of a fiery mind,
    A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
    Of general assault.
  Rey. But, my g
ood lord-
  Pol. Wherefore should you do this?
  Rey. Ay, my lord,
    I would know that.
  Pol.
 Marry, sir, here's my drift,
    And I believe it is a fetch of warrant.
    You laying these sli
ght sullies on my son
    As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' th' working,
    Mark you,
    You
r party in converse, him you would sound,
    Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
    The y
outh you breathe of guilty, be assur'd
    He closes with you in this consequence:
    'Good sir,'
 or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman'-
    According to the phrase or the addition
    Of man and co
untry-
  Rey. Very good, my lord.
  Pol. And then, sir, does 'a this- 'a does- What was I about to

say?
    By the mass, I was about to say something! Where did I leave?
  Rey. At 'closes in the 
consequence,' at 'friend or so,' and
    gentleman.'
  Pol. At 'closes in the consequence'- Ay, ma
rry!
    He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman.
    I saw him yesterday, or t'other day,
    Or t
hen, or then, with such or such; and, as you say,
    There was 'a gaming; there o'ertook in's rous
e;
    There falling out at tennis'; or perchance,
    'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'
  
  Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
    See you now-
    Your bait of falsehood takes this carp o
f truth;
    And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
    With windlasses and with assays of bias,

    By indirections find directions out.
    So, by my former lecture and advice,
    Shall you my
 son. You have me, have you not?
  Rey. My lord, I have.
  Pol. God b' wi' ye, fare ye well!
  Re
y. Good my lord!                                    [Going.]
  Pol. Observe his inclination in your
self.
  Rey. I shall, my lord.
  Pol. And let him ply his music.
  Rey. Well, my lord.
  Pol. Fa
rewell!
                                                  Exit Reynaldo.

                       
Enter Ophelia.

    How now, Ophelia? What's the matter?
  Oph. O my lord, my lord, I have been s
o affrighted!
  Pol. With what, i' th' name of God?
  Oph. My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,

    Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac'd,
    No hat upon his head, his stockings foul'd,
 
   Ungart'red, and down-gyved to his ankle;
    Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,

    And with a look so piteous in purport
    As if he had been loosed out of hell
    To speak of
 horrors- he comes before me.
  Pol. Mad for thy love?
  Oph. My lord, I do not know,
    But tru
ly I do fear it.
  Pol. What said he?
  Oph. He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
    Then g
oes he to the length of all his arm,
    And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
    He falls
 to such perusal of my face
    As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so.
    At last, a little shak
ing of mine arm,
    And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
    He rais'd a sigh so piteous 
and profound
    As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
    And end his being. That done, he lets 
me go,
    And with his head over his shoulder turn'd
    He seem'd to find his way without his ey
es,
    For out o' doors he went without their help
    And to the last bended their light on me.

  Pol. Come, go with me. I will go seek the King.
    This is the very ecstasy of love,
    Whose
 violent property fordoes itself
    And leads the will to desperate undertakings
    As oft as an
y passion under heaven
    That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
    What, have you given him
 any hard words of late?
  Oph. No, my good lord; but, as you did command,
    I did repel his let
ters and denied
    His access to me.
  Pol. That hath made him mad.
    I am sorry that with bet
ter heed and judgment
    I had not quoted him. I fear'd he did but trifle
    And meant to wrack 
thee; but beshrew my jealousy!
    By heaven, it is as proper to our age
    To cast beyond oursel
ves in our opinions
    As it is common for the younger sort
    To lack discretion. Come, go we t
o the King.
    This must be known; which, being kept close, might move
    More grief to hide tha
n hate to utter love.
    Come.
                                                         Exeunt.


Scene II.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Flourish. [Enter King and Queen, Rosencrantz and Gui
ldenstern,
cum aliis.

  King. Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
    Moreover that we 
much did long to see you,
    The need we have to use you did provoke
    Our hasty sending. Somet
hing have you heard
    Of Hamlet's transformation. So I call it,
    Sith nor th' exterior nor th
e inward man
    Resembles that it was. What it should be,
    More than his father's death, that 
thus hath put him
    So much from th' understanding of himself,
    I cannot dream of. I entreat 
you both
    That, being of so young days brought up with him,
    And since so neighbour'd to his
 youth and haviour,
    That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
    Some little time; so by
 your companies
    To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather
    So much as from occasion you ma
y glean,
    Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus
    That, open'd, lies within our remed
y.
  Queen. Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,
    And sure I am two men there are not li
ving
    To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
    To show us so much gentry and good wil
l
    As to expend your time with us awhile
    For the supply and profit of our hope,
    Your v
isitation shall receive such thanks
    As fits a king's remembrance.
  Ros. Both your Majesties

    Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
    Put your dread pleasures more into command
 
   Than to entreaty.
  Guil. But we both obey,
    And here give up ourselves, in the full bent,

    To lay our service freely at your feet,
    To be commanded.
  King. Thanks, Rosencrantz and g
entle Guildenstern.
  Queen. Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz.
    And I beseech you in
stantly to visit
    My too much changed son.- Go, some of you,
    And bring these gentlemen wher
e Hamlet is.
  Guil. Heavens make our presence and our practices
    Pleasant and helpful to him!

  Queen. Ay, amen!
                 Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, [with some
             
                                       Attendants].

                         Enter Polonius.

 
 Pol. Th' ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
    Are joyfully return'd.
  King. Thou still has
t been the father of good news.
  Pol. Have I, my lord? Assure you, my good liege,
    I hold my d
uty as I hold my soul,
    Both to my God and to my gracious king;
    And I do think- or else thi
s brain of mine
    Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
    As it hath us'd to do- that I have f
ound
    The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
  King. O, speak of that! That do I long to hear.
  P
ol. Give first admittance to th' ambassadors.
    My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.

  King. Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
                                              
  [Exit Polonius.]
    He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found
    The head and source of all
 your son's distemper.
  Queen. I doubt it is no other but the main,
    His father's death and ou
r o'erhasty marriage.
  King. Well, we shall sift him.

              Enter Polonius, Voltemand, 
and Cornelius.

    Welcome, my good friends.
    Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?

  Volt. Most fair return of greetings and desires.
    Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
   
 His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
    To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack,
    But be
tter look'd into, he truly found
    It was against your Highness; whereat griev'd,
    That so hi
s sickness, age, and impotence
    Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
    On Fortinbras;
 which he, in brief, obeys,
    Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,
    Makes vow before hi
s uncle never more
    To give th' assay of arms against your Majesty.
    Whereon old Norway, ove
rcome with joy,
    Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee
    And his commission to employ
 those soldiers,
    So levied as before, against the Polack;
    With an entreaty, herein further
 shown,
                                                [Gives a paper.]
    That it might please 
you to give quiet pass
    Through your dominions for this enterprise,
    On such regards of safe
ty and allowance
    As therein are set down.
  King. It likes us well;
    And at our more consi
der'd time we'll read,
    Answer, and think upon this business.
    Meantime we thank you for you
r well-took labour.
    Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together.
    Most welcome home!    
                   Exeunt Ambassadors.
  Pol. This business is well ended.
    My liege, and madam
, to expostulate
    What majesty should be, what duty is,
    Why day is day, night is night, and
 time is time.
    Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time.
    Therefore, since brevity is
 the soul of wit,
    And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
    I will be brief. Your 
noble son is mad.
    Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,
    What is't but to be nothing 
else but mad?
    But let that go.
  Queen. More matter, with less art.
  Pol. Madam, I swear I u
se no art at all.
    That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
    And pity 'tis 'tis true.
 A foolish figure!
    But farewell it, for I will use no art.
    Mad let us grant him then. And 
now remains
    That we find out the cause of this effect-
    Or rather say, the cause of this de
fect,
    For this effect defective comes by cause.
    Thus it remains, and the remainder thus.

    Perpend.
    I have a daughter (have while she is mine),
    Who in her duty and obedience, ma
rk,
    Hath given me this. Now gather, and surmise.
                                             
[Reads] the letter.
    'To the celestial, and my soul's idol, the most beautified
      Ophelia,'
-

    That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is a vile
      phrase.
    But you sha
ll hear. Thus:
                                                        [Reads.]
    'In her excell
ent white bosom, these, &c.'
  Queen. Came this from Hamlet to her?
  Pol. Good madam, stay awhile
. I will be faithful.     [Reads.]


          'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
            Doubt
 that the sun doth move;
          Doubt truth to be a liar;
            But never doubt I love.

      'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers; I have not art
to
    reckon my groans; but that
 I love thee best, O most best,
believe
    it. Adieu.
      'Thine evermore, most dear lady, whi
lst this machine is to
him,

HAMLET.'

    This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me;
    
And more above, hath his solicitings,
    As they fell out by time, by means, and place,
    All g
iven to mine ear.
  King. But how hath she
    Receiv'd his love?
  Pol. What do you think of me?

  King. As of a man faithful and honourable.
  Pol. I would fain prove so. But what might you thi
nk,
    When I had seen this hot love on the wing
    (As I perceiv'd it, I must tell you that,
 
   Before my daughter told me), what might you,
    Or my dear Majesty your queen here, think,
   
 If I had play'd the desk or table book,
    Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
    Or lo
ok'd upon this love with idle sight?
    What might you think? No, I went round to work
    And my
 young mistress thus I did bespeak:
    'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star.
    This must n
ot be.' And then I prescripts gave her,
    That she should lock herself from his resort,
    Admi
t no messengers, receive no tokens.
    Which done, she took the fruits of my advice,
    And he, 
repulsed, a short tale to make,
    Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
    Thence to a watch, 
thence into a weakness,
    Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
    Into the madness w
herein now he raves,
    And all we mourn for.
  King. Do you think 'tis this?
  Queen. it may be
, very like.
  Pol. Hath there been such a time- I would fain know that-
    That I have Positivel
y said ''Tis so,'
    When it prov'd otherwise.?
  King. Not that I know.
  Pol. [points to his h
ead and shoulder] Take this from this, if
this
      be otherwise.
    If circumstances lead me, 
I will find
    Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
    Within the centre.
  King. How 
may we try it further?
  Pol. You know sometimes he walks for hours together
    Here in the lobby
.
  Queen. So he does indeed.
  Pol. At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him.
    Be you and
 I behind an arras then.
    Mark the encounter. If he love her not,
    And he not from his reaso
n fall'n thereon
    Let me be no assistant for a state,
    But keep a farm and carters.
  King.
 We will try it.

                 Enter Hamlet, reading on a book.

  Queen. But look where sad
ly the poor wretch comes reading.
  Pol. Away, I do beseech you, both away
    I'll board him pres
ently. O, give me leave.
                       Exeunt King and Queen, [with Attendants].
    How 
does my good Lord Hamlet?
  Ham. Well, God-a-mercy.
  Pol. Do you know me, my lord?
  Ham. Excell
ent well. You are a fishmonger.
  Pol. Not I, my lord.
  Ham. Then I would you were so honest a ma
n.
  Pol. Honest, my lord?
  Ham. Ay, sir. To be honest, as this world goes, is to be one
man
  
  pick'd out of ten thousand.
  Pol. That's very true, my lord.
  Ham. For if the sun breed maggot
s in a dead dog, being a god
    kissing carrion- Have you a daughter?
  Pol. I have, my lord.
  
Ham. Let her not walk i' th' sun. Conception is a blessing, but
not
    as your daughter may conce
ive. Friend, look to't.
  Pol. [aside] How say you by that? Still harping on my daughter.
Yet
   
 he knew me not at first. He said I was a fishmonger. He is
far
    gone, far gone! And truly in m
y youth I suff'red much
extremity
    for love- very near this. I'll speak to him again.- What do

you
    read, my lord?
  Ham. Words, words, words.
  Pol. What is the matter, my lord?
  Ham. B
etween who?
  Pol. I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
  Ham. Slanders, sir; for the satiri
cal rogue says here that old
men
    have grey beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes

    purging thick amber and plum-tree gum; and that they have a
    plentiful lack of wit, together
 with most weak hams. All
which,
    sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I
ho
ld it
    not honesty to have it thus set down; for you yourself, sir,
    should be old as I am i
f, like a crab, you could go backward.

  Pol. [aside] Though this be madness, yet there is a meth
od
in't.-
   Will You walk out of the air, my lord?
  Ham. Into my grave?
  Pol. Indeed, that is
 out o' th' air. [Aside] How pregnant
sometimes
    his replies are! a happiness that often madnes
s hits on,
which
    reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of.
I
    will lea
ve him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting
between
    him and my daughter.- My honourable 
lord, I will most humbly
take
    my leave of you.
  Ham. You cannot, sir, take from me anything 
that I will more
    willingly part withal- except my life, except my life, except
my
    life,


                    Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Pol. Fare you well, my lord.
  Ham. 
These tedious old fools!
  Pol. You go to seek the Lord Hamlet. There he is.
  Ros. [to Polonius] 
God save you, sir!
                                                Exit [Polonius].

  Guil. My h
onour'd lord!
  Ros. My most dear lord!
  Ham. My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenst
ern?
Ah,
    Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
  Ros. As the indifferent children of the ea
rth.
  Guil. Happy in that we are not over-happy.
    On Fortune's cap we are not the very button.

  Ham. Nor the soles of her shoe?
  Ros. Neither, my lord.
  Ham. Then you live about her waist,
 or in the middle of her
    favours?
  Guil. Faith, her privates we.
  Ham. In the secret parts 
of Fortune? O! most true! she is a
    strumpet. What news ?
  Ros. None, my lord, but that the wo
rld's grown honest.
  Ham. Then is doomsday near! But your news is not true. Let me
    question m
ore in particular. What have you, my good friends,
    deserved at the hands of Fortune that she se
nds you to prison
    hither?
  Guil. Prison, my lord?
  Ham. Denmark's a prison.
  Ros. Then is
 the world one.
  Ham. A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and
    dungeons, De
nmark being one o' th' worst.
  Ros. We think not so, my lord.
  Ham. Why, then 'tis none to you; 
for there is nothing either
good
    or bad but thinking makes it so. To me it is a prison.
  Ros
. Why, then your ambition makes it one. 'Tis too narrow for
your
    mind.
  Ham. O God, I could 
be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a
    king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad
 dreams.
  Guil. Which dreams indeed are ambition; for the very substance
of
    the ambitious is
 merely the shadow of a dream.
  Ham. A dream itself is but a shadow.
  Ros. Truly, and I hold amb
ition of so airy and light a quality
that
    it is but a shadow's shadow.
  Ham. Then are our be
ggars bodies, and our monarchs and
outstretch'd
    heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we to th' c
ourt? for, by
my
    fay, I cannot reason.
  Both. We'll wait upon you.
  Ham. No such matter! I
 will not sort you with the rest of my
    servants; for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am 
most
    dreadfully attended. But in the beaten way of friendship,
what
    make you at Elsinore?

  Ros. To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
  Ham. Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thank
s; but I thank
you;
    and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny.
Were
    you
 not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free
    visitation? Come, deal justly with me. Co
me, come! Nay,
speak.
  Guil. What should we say, my lord?
  Ham. Why, anything- but to th' purpo
se. You were sent for; and
    there is a kind of confession in your looks, which your
modesties

    have not craft enough to colour. I know the good King and
Queen
    have sent for you.
  Ros.
 To what end, my lord?
  Ham. That you must teach me. But let me conjure you by the
rights
    of
 our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the
    obligation of our ever-preserved love, 
and by what more dear
a
    better proposer could charge you withal, be even and direct
with
   
 me, whether you were sent for or no.
  Ros. [aside to Guildenstern] What say you?
  Ham. [aside] 
Nay then, I have an eye of you.- If you love me,
hold
    not off.
  Guil. My lord, we were sent 
for.
  Ham. I will tell you why. So shall my anticipation prevent your
    discovery, and your sec
recy to the King and Queen moult no
    feather. I have of late- but wherefore I know not- lost all

my
    mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes
so
    heavily with my dispo
sition that this goodly frame, the
earth,
    seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellen
t canopy,
the
    air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this
majestical
    roof fret
ted with golden fire- why, it appeareth no other
thing
    to me than a foul and pestilent congreg
ation of vapours. What
a
    piece of work is a man! how noble in reason! how infinite in
    fac
ulties! in form and moving how express and admirable! in
    action how like an angel! in apprehens
ion how like a god! the
    beauty of the world, the paragon of animals! And yet to me
what
    i
s this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me- no, nor
woman
    neither, though by your smilin
g you seem to say so.
  Ros. My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.
  Ham. Why did you l
augh then, when I said 'Man delights not me'?
  Ros. To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, 
what lenten
    entertainment the players shall receive from you. We coted
them
    on the way, a
nd hither are they coming to offer you service.
  Ham. He that plays the king shall be welcome- his
 Majesty shall
    have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil
and
    target; 
the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humorous man
shall
    end his part in peace; the clown shall
 make those laugh whose
    lungs are tickle o' th' sere; and the lady shall say her mind
    free
ly, or the blank verse shall halt for't. What players are
    they?
  Ros. Even those you were won
t to take such delight in, the
    tragedians of the city.
  Ham. How chances it they travel? Thei
r residence, both in
    reputation and profit, was better both ways.
  Ros. I think their inhibit
ion comes by the means of the late
    innovation.
  Ham. Do they hold the same estimation they di
d when I was in
the
    city? Are they so follow'd?
  Ros. No indeed are they not.
  Ham. How co
mes it? Do they grow rusty?
  Ros. Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there
is,
 
   sir, an eyrie of children, little eyases, that cry out on the
top
    of question and are most 
tyrannically clapp'd for't. These
are now
    the fashion, and so berattle the common stages (so t
hey call
    them) that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goosequills and
    dare scarce come th
ither.
  Ham. What, are they children? Who maintains 'em? How are they
    escoted? Will they purs
ue the quality no longer than they can
    sing? Will they not say afterwards, if they should grow

    themselves to common players (as it is most like, if their
means
    are no better), their wr
iters do them wrong to make them
exclaim
    against their own succession.
  Ros. Faith, there ha
s been much to do on both sides; and the
nation
    holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy. 
There was, for
a
    while, no money bid for argument unless the poet and the
player
    went to
 cuffs in the question.
  Ham. Is't possible?
  Guil. O, there has been much throwing about of bra
ins.
  Ham. Do the boys carry it away?
  Ros. Ay, that they do, my lord- Hercules and his load too
.
  Ham. It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark,
and
    those that would make m
ows at him while my father lived give
    twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his pic
ture
in
    little. 'Sblood, there is something in this more than
natural, if
    philosophy cou
ld find it out.

                     Flourish for the Players.

  Guil. There are the players.

  Ham. Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come!
Th'
    appurtenance of welcome 
is fashion and ceremony. Let me
comply
    with you in this garb, lest my extent to the players (w
hich I
    tell you must show fairly outwards) should more appear like
    entertainment than your
s. You are welcome. But my
uncle-father
    and aunt-mother are deceiv'd.
  Guil. In what, my dea
r lord?
  Ham. I am but mad north-north-west. When the wind is southerly
I
    know a hawk from a
 handsaw.

                            Enter Polonius.

  Pol. Well be with you, gentlemen!
  H
am. Hark you, Guildenstern- and you too- at each ear a hearer!
    That great baby you see there is
 not yet out of his swaddling
    clouts.
  Ros. Happily he's the second time come to them; for th
ey say an
old
    man is twice a child.
  Ham. I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players
. Mark
it.-
   You say right, sir; a Monday morning; twas so indeed.
  Pol. My lord, I have news 
to tell you.
  Ham. My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an
actor in
    Rome-
  P
ol. The actors are come hither, my lord.
  Ham. Buzz, buzz!
  Pol. Upon my honour-
  Ham. Then ca
me each actor on his ass-
  Pol. The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy,
    his
tory, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral,
    tragical-historical, tragical-comical-hi
storical-pastoral;
scene
    individable, or poem unlimited. Seneca cannot be too heavy,
nor
   
 Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these
are
    the only men.
  Ham. O Jep
hthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
  Pol. What treasure had he, my lord?
  Ham. W
hy,

         'One fair daughter, and no more,
           The which he loved passing well.'

  
Pol. [aside] Still on my daughter.
  Ham. Am I not i' th' right, old Jephthah?
  Pol. If you call 
me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I
    love passing well.
  Ham. Nay, that follows not
.
  Pol. What follows then, my lord?
  Ham. Why,

           'As by lot, God wot,'

 and then,
 you know,

           'It came to pass, as most like it was.'

    The first row of the pious c
hanson will show you more; for
look
    where my abridgment comes.

                     Enter f
our or five Players.

    You are welcome, masters; welcome, all.- I am glad to see
thee
    wel
l.- Welcome, good friends.- O, my old friend? Why, thy
face is
    valanc'd since I saw thee last.
 Com'st' thou to' beard me in
    Denmark?- What, my young lady and mistress? By'r Lady, your
    
ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last by the
    altitude of a chopine. Pray God yo
ur voice, like a piece of
    uncurrent gold, be not crack'd within the ring.- Masters, you
are
 
   all welcome. We'll e'en to't like French falconers, fly at
    anything we see. We'll have a spe
ech straight. Come, give us
a
    taste of your quality. Come, a passionate speech.
  1. Play. Wh
at speech, my good lord?
  Ham. I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never
acted;
    
or if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember,
pleas'd
    not the million, 'twas caviary
 to the general; but it was (as
I
    receiv'd it, and others, whose judgments in such matters
cr
ied in
    the top of mine) an excellent play, well digested in the
scenes,
    set down with as 
much modesty as cunning. I remember one said
    there were no sallets in the lines to make the mat
ter
savoury,
    nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of
    affectation; but
 call'd it an honest method, as wholesome as
    sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. O
ne speech
in't
    I chiefly lov'd. 'Twas AEneas' tale to Dido, and thereabout
of it
    especia
lly where he speaks of Priam's slaughter. If it live
in
    your memory, begin at this line- let m
e see, let me see:

         'The rugged Pyrrhus, like th' Hyrcanian beast-'

    'Tis not so; i
t begins with Pyrrhus:

         'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
         Black as his 
purpose, did the night resemble
         When he lay couched in the ominous horse,
         Hath n
ow this dread and black complexion smear'd
         With heraldry more dismal. Head to foot
      
   Now is be total gules, horridly trick'd
         With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons
,
         Bak'd and impasted with the parching streets,
         That lend a tyrannous and a damn
ed light
         To their lord's murther. Roasted in wrath and fire,
         And thus o'ersized 
with coagulate gore,
         With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
         Old grandsir
e Priam seeks.'

    So, proceed you.
  Pol. Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and
 good
     discretion.

  1. Play. 'Anon he finds him,
      Striking too short at Greeks. His a
ntique sword,
      Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
      Repugnant to command. Unequa
l match'd,
      Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide;
      But with the whiff and wind 
of his fell sword
      Th' unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
      Seeming to feel thi
s blow, with flaming top
      Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
      Takes prisoner P
yrrhus' ear. For lo! his sword,
      Which was declining on the milky head
      Of reverend Pria
m, seem'd i' th' air to stick.
      So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
      And, like a neu
tral to his will and matter,
      Did nothing.
      But, as we often see, against some storm,
 
     A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
      The bold winds speechless, and the orb b
elow
      As hush as death- anon the dreadful thunder
      Doth rend the region; so, after Pyrrh
us' pause,
      Aroused vengeance sets him new awork;
      And never did the Cyclops' hammers fa
ll
      On Mars's armour, forg'd for proof eterne,
      With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding
 sword
      Now falls on Priam.
      Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods,
      In ge
neral synod take away her power;
      Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
      And 
bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
      As low as to the fiends!

  Pol. This is too l
ong.
  Ham. It shall to the barber's, with your beard.- Prithee say
on.
    He's for a jig or a t
ale of bawdry, or he sleeps. Say on;
come to
    Hecuba.

  1. Play. 'But who, O who, had seen t
he mobled queen-'

  Ham. 'The mobled queen'?
  Pol. That's good! 'Mobled queen' is good.

  1.
 Play. 'Run barefoot up and down, threat'ning the flames
      With bisson rheum; a clout upon that
 head
      Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
      About her lank and all o'erteemed l
oins,
      A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up-
      Who this had seen, with tongue in ven
om steep'd
      'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have pronounc'd.
      But if the gods them
selves did see her then,
      When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
      In Mincing with his
 sword her husband's limbs,
      The instant burst of clamour that she made
      (Unless things 
mortal move them not at all)
      Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven
      And pass
ion in the gods.'

  Pol. Look, whe'r he has not turn'd his colour, and has tears
in's
    eyes.
 Prithee no more!
  Ham. 'Tis well. I'll have thee speak out the rest of this
soon.-
    Good my 
lord, will you see the players well bestow'd? Do you
    hear? Let them be well us'd; for they are 
the abstract and
brief
    chronicles of the time. After your death you were better have
a
    b
ad epitaph than their ill report while you live.
  Pol. My lord, I will use them according to their
 desert.
  Ham. God's bodykins, man, much better! Use every man after his
    desert, and who shou
ld scape whipping? Use them after your
own
    honour and dignity. The less they deserve, the more
 merit is
in
    your bounty. Take them in.
  Pol. Come, sirs.
  Ham. Follow him, friends. We'll
 hear a play to-morrow.
                 Exeunt Polonius and Players [except the First].
    Dost 
thou hear me, old friend? Can you play 'The Murther of
    Gonzago'?
  1. Play. Ay, my lord.
  Ha
m. We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need, study a
    speech of some dozen or sixteen l
ines which I would set down
and
    insert in't, could you not?
  1. Play. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. V
ery well. Follow that lord- and look you mock him not.
                                            
[Exit First Player.]
    My good friends, I'll leave you till night. You are welcome
to
    Elsin
ore.
  Ros. Good my lord!
  Ham. Ay, so, God b' wi' ye!
                            [Exeunt Rosen
crantz and Guildenstern
    Now I am alone.
    O what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
    Is it 
not monstrous that this player here,
    But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
    Could force 
his soul so to his own conceit
    That, from her working, all his visage wann'd,
    Tears in his
 eyes, distraction in's aspect,
    A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
    With forms 
to his conceit? And all for nothing!
    For Hecuba!
    What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
 
   That he should weep for her? What would he do,
    Had he the motive and the cue for passion
  
  That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
    And cleave the general ear with horrid speec
h;
    Make mad the guilty and appal the free,
    Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed
    Th
e very faculties of eyes and ears.
    Yet I,
    A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak
    Like 
John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
    And can say nothing! No, not for a king,
    Upon whose
 property and most dear life
    A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
    Who calls me villain
? breaks my pate across?
    Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?
    Tweaks me by th' nos
e? gives me the lie i' th' throat
    As deep as to the lungs? Who does me this, ha?
    'Swounds,
 I should take it! for it cannot be
    But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall
    To make oppressi
on bitter, or ere this
    I should have fatted all the region kites
    With this slave's offal. 
Bloody bawdy villain!
    Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
    O, vengeance!

    Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
    That I, the son of a dear father murther'd,
 
   Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
    Must (like a whore) unpack my heart with words
 
   And fall a-cursing like a very drab,
    A scullion!
    Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! Hum,
 I have heard
    That guilty creatures, sitting at a play,
    Have by the very cunning of the sc
ene
    Been struck so to the soul that presently
    They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
  
  For murther, though it have no tongue, will speak
    With most miraculous organ, I'll have these
 Players
    Play something like the murther of my father
    Before mine uncle. I'll observe his 
looks;
    I'll tent him to the quick. If he but blench,
    I know my course. The spirit that I h
ave seen
    May be a devil; and the devil hath power
    T' assume a pleasing shape; yea, and per
haps
    Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
    As he is very potent with such spirits,
    Ab
uses me to damn me. I'll have grounds
    More relative than this. The play's the thing
    Wherei
n I'll catch the conscience of the King.         Exit.

ACT III. Scene I.
Elsin
ore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern,
and 
Lords.

  King. And can you by no drift of circumstance
    Get from him why he puts on this conf
usion,
    Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
    With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
  Ro
s. He does confess he feels himself distracted,
    But from what cause he will by no means speak.

  Guil. Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
    But with a crafty madness keeps aloof
    W
hen we would bring him on to some confession
    Of his true state.
  Queen. Did he receive you we
ll?
  Ros. Most like a gentleman.
  Guil. But with much forcing of his disposition.
  Ros. Niggar
d of question, but of our demands
    Most free in his reply.
  Queen. Did you assay him
    To a
ny pastime?
  Ros. Madam, it so fell out that certain players
    We o'erraught on the way. Of the
se we told him,
    And there did seem in him a kind of joy
    To hear of it. They are here about
 the court,
    And, as I think, they have already order
    This night to play before him.
  Pol
. 'Tis most true;
    And he beseech'd me to entreat your Majesties
    To hear and see the matter
.
  King. With all my heart, and it doth much content me
    To hear him so inclin'd.
    Good ge
ntlemen, give him a further edge
    And drive his purpose on to these delights.
  Ros. We shall, 
my lord.
                            Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
  King. Sweet Gertrude, 
leave us too;
    For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
    That he, as 'twere by accident, 
may here
    Affront Ophelia.
    Her father and myself (lawful espials)
    Will so bestow ourse
lves that, seeing unseen,
    We may of their encounter frankly judge
    And gather by him, as he
 is behav'd,
    If't be th' affliction of his love, or no,
    That thus he suffers for.
  Queen
. I shall obey you;
    And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
    That your good beauties be the h
appy cause
    Of Hamlet's wildness. So shall I hope your virtues
    Will bring him to his wonted
 way again,
    To both your honours.
  Oph. Madam, I wish it may.
                              
                     [Exit Queen.]
  Pol. Ophelia, walk you here.- Gracious, so please you,
    We
 will bestow ourselves.- [To Ophelia] Read on this book,
    That show of such an exercise may colo
ur
    Your loneliness.- We are oft to blame in this,
    'Tis too much prov'd, that with devotion
's visage
    And pious action we do sugar o'er
    The Devil himself.
  King. [aside] O, 'tis to
o true!
    How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
    The harlot's cheek, beautied
 with plast'ring art,
    Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
    Than is my deed to my mo
st painted word.
    O heavy burthen!
  Pol. I hear him coming. Let's withdraw, my lord.
        
                              Exeunt King and Polonius].

                           Enter Hamlet.


  Ham. To be, or not to be- that is the question:
    Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer

    The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
    Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
 
   And by opposing end them. To die- to sleep-
    No more; and by a sleep to say we end
    The h
eartache, and the thousand natural shocks
    That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation
    Devou
tly to be wish'd. To die- to sleep.
    To sleep- perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub!
    For
 in that sleep of death what dreams may come
    When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
    M
ust give us pause. There's the respect
    That makes calamity of so long life.
    For who would 
bear the whips and scorns of time,
    Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
    The p
angs of despis'd love, the law's delay,
    The insolence of office, and the spurns
    That patie
nt merit of th' unworthy takes,
    When he himself might his quietus make
    With a bare bodkin?
 Who would these fardels bear,
    To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
    But that the dread o
f something after death-
    The undiscover'd country, from whose bourn
    No traveller returns- 
puzzles the will,
    And makes us rather bear those ills we have
    Than fly to others that we k
now not of?
    Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
    And thus the native hue of resolu
tion
    Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
    And enterprises of great pith and mom
ent
    With this regard their currents turn awry
    And lose the name of action.- Soft you now!

    The fair Ophelia!- Nymph, in thy orisons
    Be all my sins rememb'red.
  Oph. Good my lord,

    How does your honour for this many a day?
  Ham. I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
  Oph.
 My lord, I have remembrances of yours
    That I have longed long to re-deliver.
    I pray you, 
now receive them.
  Ham. No, not I!
    I never gave you aught.
  Oph. My honour'd lord, you know
 right well you did,
    And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd
    As made the things mo
re rich. Their perfume lost,
    Take these again; for to the noble mind
    Rich gifts wax poor w
hen givers prove unkind.
    There, my lord.
  Ham. Ha, ha! Are you honest?
  Oph. My lord?
  Ha
m. Are you fair?
  Oph. What means your lordship?
  Ham. That if you be honest and fair, your hone
sty should admit
no
    discourse to your beauty.
  Oph. Could beauty, my lord, have better comme
rce than with
honesty?
  Ham. Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform
    honest
y from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty
can
    translate beauty into his likeness. 
This was sometime a
paradox,
    but now the time gives it proof. I did love you once.
  Oph. Ind
eed, my lord, you made me believe so.
  Ham. You should not have believ'd me; for virtue cannot so

    inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it. I loved
you
    not.
  Oph. I was the mor
e deceived.
  Ham. Get thee to a nunnery! Why wouldst thou be a breeder of
    sinners? I am mysel
f indifferent honest, but yet I could
accuse
    me of such things that it were better my mother h
ad not borne
me.
    I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more offences at
my
    beck t
han I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give
    them shape, or time to act them in. Wha
t should such fellows
as I
    do, crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves
all;

    believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where's your
    father?
  Oph. At home, my lord
.
  Ham. Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool
    nowhere but in's own house.
 Farewell.
  Oph. O, help him, you sweet heavens!
  Ham. If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this p
lague for thy
dowry:
    be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not
escape
    ca
lumny. Get thee to a nunnery. Go, farewell. Or if thou wilt
    needs marry, marry a fool; for wise
 men know well enough what
    monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go; and quickly too.
    F
arewell.
  Oph. O heavenly powers, restore him!
  Ham. I have heard of your paintings too, well en
ough. God hath
    given you one face, and you make yourselves another. You jig,
you
    amble, a
nd you lisp; you nickname God's creatures and make
your
    wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I'll
 no more on't! it hath
made
    me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages. Those that are
   
 married already- all but one- shall live; the rest shall keep
as
    they are. To a nunnery, go. 
                           Exit.
  Oph. O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
    The courtier'
s, scholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword,
    Th' expectancy and rose of the fair state,
    Th
e glass of fashion and the mould of form,
    Th' observ'd of all observers- quite, quite down!
  
  And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
    That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
    Now 
see that noble and most sovereign reason,
    Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
   
 That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
    Blasted with ecstasy. O, woe is me
    T' have
 seen what I have seen, see what I see!

                   Enter King and Polonius.

  King. Lo
ve? his affections do not that way tend;
    Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,
  
  Was not like madness. There's something in his soul
    O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;

    And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
    Will be some danger; which for to prevent,
    
I have in quick determination
    Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England
    For the dem
and of our neglected tribute.
    Haply the seas, and countries different,
    With variable objec
ts, shall expel
    This something-settled matter in his heart,
    Whereon his brains still beati
ng puts him thus
    From fashion of himself. What think you on't?
  Pol. It shall do well. But ye
t do I believe
    The origin and commencement of his grief
    Sprung from neglected love.- How n
ow, Ophelia?
    You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said.
    We heard it all.- My lord, do as 
you please;
    But if you hold it fit, after the play
    Let his queen mother all alone entreat 
him
    To show his grief. Let her be round with him;
    And I'll be plac'd so please you, in the
 ear
    Of all their conference. If she find him not,
    To England send him; or confine him whe
re
    Your wisdom best shall think.
  King. It shall be so.
    Madness in great ones must not u
nwatch'd go.         Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. hall in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet and t
hree of the Players.

  Ham. Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounc'd it to you,
    trippin
gly on the tongue. But if you mouth it, as many of our
    players do, I had as live the town crier
 spoke my lines. Nor
do
    not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all
    gently
; for in the very torrent, tempest, and (as I may say)
    whirlwind of your passion, you must acqu
ire and beget a
    temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to
the
    soul to h
ear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion
to
    tatters, to very rags, to split the ca
rs of the groundlings,
who
    (for the most part) are capable of nothing but inexplicable
dumb

    shows and noise. I would have such a fellow whipp'd for
o'erdoing
    Termagant. It out-herods
 Herod. Pray you avoid it.
  Player. I warrant your honour.
  Ham. Be not too tame neither; but le
t your own discretion be
your
    tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the action;
wit
h
    this special observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of
    nature: for anything so ov
erdone is from the purpose of
playing,
    whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to ho
ld, as
    'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show Virtue her own
feature,
    scorn her own ima
ge, and the very age and body of the time
his
    form and pressure. Now this overdone, or come ta
rdy off,
though
    it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious
    grieve; the ce
nsure of the which one must in your allowance
    o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be 
players that
I
    have seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly (not
to
    speak it
 profanely), that, neither having the accent of
    Christians, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, n
or man, have
so
    strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of Nature's
    journeymen had
 made men, and not made them well, they
imitated
    humanity so abominably.
  Player. I hope we 
have reform'd that indifferently with us,
sir.
  Ham. O, reform it altogether! And let those that 
play your
clowns
    speak no more than is set down for them. For there be of them
    that will 
themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren
    spectators to laugh too, though in the mean
 time some
necessary
    question of the play be then to be considered. That's
villanous
    and
 shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it.
Go
    make you ready.
                 
                                Exeunt Players.

            Enter Polonius, Rosencrantz, and Guil
denstern.

    How now, my lord? Will the King hear this piece of work?
  Pol. And the Queen too,
 and that presently.
  Ham. Bid the players make haste, [Exit Polonius.] Will you two
    help to 
hasten them?
  Both. We will, my lord.                       Exeunt they two.
  Ham. What, ho, Hor
atio!

                      Enter Horatio.

  Hor. Here, sweet lord, at your service.
  Ham. H
oratio, thou art e'en as just a man
    As e'er my conversation cop'd withal.
  Hor. O, my dear lo
rd!
  Ham. Nay, do not think I flatter;
    For what advancement may I hope from thee,
    That n
o revenue hast but thy good spirits
    To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?

    No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
    And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
  
  Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
    Since my dear soul was mistress of her choic
e
    And could of men distinguish, her election
    Hath seal'd thee for herself. For thou hast b
een
    As one, in suff'ring all, that suffers nothing;
    A man that Fortune's buffets and rewar
ds
    Hast ta'en with equal thanks; and blest are those
    Whose blood and judgment are so well 
commingled
    That they are not a pipe for Fortune's finger
    To sound what stop she please. Gi
ve me that man
    That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
    In my heart's core, ay, in
 my heart of heart,
    As I do thee. Something too much of this I
    There is a play to-night be
fore the King.
    One scene of it comes near the circumstance,
    Which I have told thee, of my 
father's death.
    I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
    Even with the very comment of t
hy soul
    Observe my uncle. If his occulted guilt
    Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
   
 It is a damned ghost that we have seen,
    And my imaginations are as foul
    As Vulcan's stith
y. Give him heedful note;
    For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,
    And after we will both o
ur judgments join
    In censure of his seeming.
  Hor. Well, my lord.
    If he steal aught the 
whilst this play is playing,
    And scape detecting, I will pay the theft.

    Sound a flourish
. [Enter Trumpets and Kettledrums. Danish
    march. [Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencr
antz,
      Guildenstern, and other Lords attendant, with the Guard

g torches.

  Ham. They are coming to the play. I must be idle.
    Get you a place.
  King. How
 fares our cousin Hamlet?
  Ham. Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish. I eat the
air,
   
 promise-cramm'd. You cannot feed capons so.
  King. I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet. These
 words are
not
    mine.
  Ham. No, nor mine now. [To Polonius] My lord, you play'd once
    i' 
th' university, you say?
  Pol. That did I, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.
  Ham. What d
id you enact?
  Pol. I did enact Julius Caesar; I was kill'd i' th' Capitol;
Brutus
    kill'd me
.
  Ham. It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf
there. Be
    the players ready.
 
 Ros. Ay, my lord. They stay upon your patience.
  Queen. Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.

  Ham. No, good mother. Here's metal more attractive.
  Pol. [to the King] O, ho! do you mark that?

  Ham. Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
                                  [Sits down at Ophelia's f
eet.]

  Oph. No, my lord.
  Ham. I mean, my head upon your lap?
  Oph. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Do 
you think I meant country matters?
  Oph. I think nothing, my lord.
  Ham. That's a fair thought t
o lie between maids' legs.
  Oph. What is, my lord?
  Ham. Nothing.
  Oph. You are merry, my lord
.
  Ham. Who, I?
  Oph. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. O God, your only jig-maker! What should a man do but 
be
merry?
    For look you how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father
died
    within 's two 
hours.
  Oph. Nay 'tis twice two months, my lord.
  Ham. So long? Nay then, let the devil wear bla
ck, for I'll have
a
    suit of sables. O heavens! die two months ago, and not
forgotten
    yet
? Then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his
life
    half a year. But, by'r Lady, he 
must build churches then; or
else
    shall he suffer not thinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose


    epitaph is 'For O, for O, the hobby-horse is forgot!'

               Hautboys play. The d
umb show enters.

    Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing
    him and he 
her. She kneels, and makes show of protestation
    unto him. He takes her up, and declines his hea
d upon her
    neck. He lays him down upon a bank of flowers. She, seeing
    him asleep, leaves h
im. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his
    crown, kisses it, pours poison in the sleeper's ears,
 and
    leaves him. The Queen returns, finds the King dead, and makes
    passionate action. The 
Poisoner with some three or four
Mutes,
    comes in again, seem to condole with her. The dead bod
y is
    carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with gifts; she
    seems harsh and unwilling 
awhile, but in the end accepts
    his love.
                                                     
    Exeunt.

  Oph. What means this, my lord?
  Ham. Marry, this is miching malhecho; it means mi
schief.
  Oph. Belike this show imports the argument of the play.

                      Enter Pr
ologue.

  Ham. We shall know by this fellow. The players cannot keep
counsel;
    they'll tell 
all.
  Oph. Will he tell us what this show meant?
  Ham. Ay, or any show that you'll show him. Be 
not you asham'd
to
    show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means.
  Oph. You are naught, yo
u are naught! I'll mark the play.

    Pro. For us, and for our tragedy,
      Here stooping to y
our clemency,
      We beg your hearing patiently.                     [Exit.]

  Ham. Is this a 
prologue, or the posy of a ring?
  Oph. 'Tis brief, my lord.
  Ham. As woman's love.

          
    Enter [two Players as] King and Queen.

    King. Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone ro
und
      Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
      And thirty dozen moons with borrowed
 sheen
      About the world have times twelve thirties been,
      Since love our hearts, and Hym
en did our hands,
      Unite comutual in most sacred bands.
    Queen. So many journeys may the s
un and moon
      Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
      But woe is me! you are so sick 
of late,
      So far from cheer and from your former state.
      That I distrust you. Yet, thoug
h I distrust,
      Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must;
      For women's fear and love hold
s quantity,
      In neither aught, or in extremity.
      Now what my love is, proof hath made yo
u know;
      And as my love is siz'd, my fear is so.
      Where love is great, the littlest doub
ts are fear;
      Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.
    King. Faith, I must 
leave thee, love, and shortly too;
      My operant powers their functions leave to do.
      And 
thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
      Honour'd, belov'd, and haply one as kind
      Fo
r husband shalt thou-
    Queen. O, confound the rest!
      Such love must needs be treason in my
 breast.
      When second husband let me be accurst!
      None wed the second but who killed the
 first.

  Ham. [aside] Wormwood, wormwood!

    Queen. The instances that second marriage move

      Are base respects of thrift, but none of love.
      A second time I kill my husband dead
 
     When second husband kisses me in bed.
    King. I do believe you think what now you speak;
  
    But what we do determine oft we break.
      Purpose is but the slave to memory,
      Of viol
ent birth, but poor validity;
      Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree,
      But fa
ll unshaken when they mellow be.
      Most necessary 'tis that we forget
      To pay ourselves w
hat to ourselves is debt.
      What to ourselves in passion we propose,
      The passion ending,
 doth the purpose lose.
      The violence of either grief or joy
      Their own enactures with t
hemselves destroy.
      Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
      Grief joys, joy grie
ves, on slender accident.
      This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
      That even ou
r loves should with our fortunes change;
      For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
      Whe
ther love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
      The great man down, you mark his favourite flie
s,
      The poor advanc'd makes friends of enemies;
      And hitherto doth love on fortune tend,

      For who not needs shall never lack a friend,
      And who in want a hollow friend doth try
,
      Directly seasons him his enemy.
      But, orderly to end where I begun,
      Our wills 
and fates do so contrary run
      That our devices still are overthrown;
      Our thoughts are o
urs, their ends none of our own.
      So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
      But die thy
 thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
    Queen. Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light,
   
   Sport and repose lock from me day and night,
      To desperation turn my trust and hope,
     
 An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope,
      Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
      Me
et what I would have well, and it destroy,
      Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
   
   If, once a widow, ever I be wife!

  Ham. If she should break it now!

    King. 'Tis deeply 
sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile.
      My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile
      The
 tedious day with sleep.
    Queen. Sleep rock thy brain,
                                        
            [He] sleeps.
      And never come mischance between us twain!
Exit.

  Ham. Madam, h
ow like you this play?
  Queen. The lady doth protest too much, methinks.
  Ham. O, but she'll kee
p her word.
  King. Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in't?
  Ham. No, no! They do 
but jest, poison in jest; no offence i'
th'
    world.
  King. What do you call the play?
  Ham.
 'The Mousetrap.' Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the
    image of a murther done in Vienna. G
onzago is the duke's
name;
    his wife, Baptista. You shall see anon. 'Tis a knavish piece
of
 
   work; but what o' that? Your Majesty, and we that have free
    souls, it touches us not. Let th
e gall'd jade winch; our
withers
    are unwrung.

                         Enter Lucianus.

 
   This is one Lucianus, nephew to the King.
  Oph. You are as good as a chorus, my lord.
  Ham. I
 could interpret between you and your love, if I could
see
    the puppets dallying.
  Oph. You a
re keen, my lord, you are keen.
  Ham. It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
  Oph. St
ill better, and worse.
  Ham. So you must take your husbands.- Begin, murtherer. Pox,
leave
    t
hy damnable faces, and begin! Come, the croaking raven doth
    bellow for revenge.

    Luc. Tho
ughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
      Confederate season, else no creature se
eing;
      Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,
      With Hecate's ban thrice blasted
, thrice infected,
      Thy natural magic and dire property
      On wholesome life usurp immedia
tely.
                                   Pours the poison in his ears.

  Ham. He poisons him i' 
th' garden for's estate. His name's
Gonzago.
    The story is extant, and written in very choice I
talian. You
    shall see anon how the murtherer gets the love of Gonzago's
wife.
  Oph. The King
 rises.
  Ham. What, frighted with false fire?
  Queen. How fares my lord?
  Pol. Give o'er the p
lay.
  King. Give me some light! Away!
  All. Lights, lights, lights!
                           
   Exeunt all but Hamlet and Horatio.
  Ham.   Why, let the strucken deer go weep,
          The h
art ungalled play;
         For some must watch, while some must sleep:
          Thus runs the wo
rld away.
    Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers- if the rest of
my
    fortunes turn 
Turk with me-with two Provincial roses on my
raz'd
    shoes, get me a fellowship in a cry of play
ers, sir?
  Hor. Half a share.
  Ham.   A whole one I!
         For thou dost know, O Damon dear,

           This realm dismantled was
         Of Jove himself; and now reigns here
           A 
very, very- pajock.
  Hor. You might have rhym'd.
  Ham. O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's wor
d for a thousand
    pound! Didst perceive?
  Hor. Very well, my lord.
  Ham. Upon the talk of th
e poisoning?
  Hor. I did very well note him.
  Ham.   Aha! Come, some music! Come, the recorders!

         For if the King like not the comedy,
         Why then, belike he likes it not, perdy.

    Come, some music!

                Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Guil. Good my lord
, vouchsafe me a word with you.
  Ham. Sir, a whole history.
  Guil. The King, sir-
  Ham. Ay, si
r, what of him?
  Guil. Is in his retirement, marvellous distemper'd.
  Ham. With drink, sir?
  G
uil. No, my lord; rather with choler.
  Ham. Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify 
this
to
    the doctor; for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps
    plunge him into far 
more choler.
  Guil. Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame, and
start
    not so wildl
y from my affair.
  Ham. I am tame, sir; pronounce.
  Guil. The Queen, your mother, in most great 
affliction of
spirit
    hath sent me to you.
  Ham. You are welcome.
  Guil. Nay, good my lord,
 this courtesy is not of the right
breed.
    If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer
, I will
do
    your mother's commandment; if not, your pardon and my return
    shall be the end
 of my business.
  Ham. Sir, I cannot.
  Guil. What, my lord?
  Ham. Make you a wholesome answer;
 my wit's diseas'd. But, sir,
such
    answer as I can make, you shall command; or rather, as you

say,
    my mother. Therefore no more, but to the matter! My mother,
you
    say-
  Ros. Then t
hus she says: your behaviour hath struck her into
    amazement and admiration.
  Ham. O wonderful
 son, that can so stonish a mother! But is
there no
    sequel at the heels of this mother's admir
ation? Impart.
  Ros. She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to
bed.
  Ham. We sh
all obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any
    further trade with us?
  Ros. My lord, y
ou once did love me.
  Ham. And do still, by these pickers and stealers!
  Ros. Good my lord, what
 is your cause of distemper? You do
surely
    bar the door upon your own liberty, if you deny you
r griefs
to
    your friend.
  Ham. Sir, I lack advancement.
  Ros. How can that be, when you ha
ve the voice of the King
himself
    for your succession in Denmark?
  Ham. Ay, sir, but 'while t
he grass grows'- the proverb is
something
    musty.

                     Enter the Players wit
h recorders.

    O, the recorders! Let me see one. To withdraw with you- why
do
    you go abou
t to recover the wind of me, as if you would drive
me
    into a toil?
  Guil. O my lord, if my d
uty be too bold, my love is too
unmannerly.
  Ham. I do not well understand that. Will you play up
on this
pipe?
  Guil. My lord, I cannot.
  Ham. I pray you.
  Guil. Believe me, I cannot.
  Ham
. I do beseech you.
  Guil. I know, no touch of it, my lord.
  Ham. It is as easy as lying. Govern
 these ventages with your
    fingers and thumbs, give it breath with your mouth, and it
will
   
 discourse most eloquent music. Look you, these are the stops.
  Guil. But these cannot I command t
o any utt'rance of harmony. I
    have not the skill.
  Ham. Why, look you now, how unworthy a thi
ng you make of me!
You
    would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you
would
    pl
uck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound me from my
    lowest note to the top of my compas
s; and there is much
music,
    excellent voice, in this little organ, yet cannot you make it
   
 speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am easier to be play'd on than
a
    pipe? Call me what instrument
 you will, though you can fret
me,
    you cannot play upon me.

                        Enter P
olonius.

    God bless you, sir!
  Pol. My lord, the Queen would speak with you, and presently.

  Ham. Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
  Pol. By th' mass, and 'tis lik
e a camel indeed.
  Ham. Methinks it is like a weasel.
  Pol. It is back'd like a weasel.
  Ham. 
Or like a whale.
  Pol. Very like a whale.
  Ham. Then will I come to my mother by-and-by.- They f
ool me to
the
    top of my bent.- I will come by-and-by.
  Pol. I will say so.                  
                    Exit.
  Ham. 'By-and-by' is easily said.- Leave me, friends.
                 
                       [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]

    'Tis now the very witching time of night,
  
  When churchyards yawn, and hell itself breathes out
    Contagion to this world. Now could I drin
k hot blood
    And do such bitter business as the day
    Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my
 mother!
    O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever
    The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom
.
    Let me be cruel, not unnatural;
    I will speak daggers to her, but use none.
    My tongu
e and soul in this be hypocrites-
    How in my words somever she be shent,
    To give them seals
 never, my soul, consent!             Exit.




Scene III.
A room in the Castle.

Enter King
, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.

  King. I like him not, nor stands it safe with us
    To let h
is madness range. Therefore prepare you;
    I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
    And he
 to England shall along with you.
    The terms of our estate may not endure
    Hazard so near us
 as doth hourly grow
    Out of his lunacies.
  Guil. We will ourselves provide.
    Most holy an
d religious fear it is
    To keep those many many bodies safe
    That live and feed upon your Ma
jesty.
  Ros. The single and peculiar life is bound
    With all the strength and armour of the mi
nd
    To keep itself from noyance; but much more
    That spirit upon whose weal depends and rest
s
    The lives of many. The cesse of majesty
    Dies not alone, but like a gulf doth draw
    W
hat's near it with it. It is a massy wheel,
    Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,
    To w
hose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
    Are mortis'd and adjoin'd; which when it falls,
  
  Each small annexment, petty consequence,
    Attends the boist'rous ruin. Never alone
    Did th
e king sigh, but with a general groan.
  King. Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;
    For
 we will fetters put upon this fear,
    Which now goes too free-footed.
  Both. We will haste us.

                                               Exeunt Gentlemen.

                   Enter Polon
ius.

  Pol. My lord, he's going to his mother's closet.
    Behind the arras I'll convey myself

    To hear the process. I'll warrant she'll tax him home;
    And, as you said, and wisely was it
 said,
    'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,
    Since nature makes them partial, s
hould o'erhear
    The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege.
    I'll call upon you ere you
 go to bed
    And tell you what I know.
  King. Thanks, dear my lord.
                          
                      Exit [Polonius].
    O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven;
    It hath
 the primal eldest curse upon't,
    A brother's murther! Pray can I not,
    Though inclination b
e as sharp as will.
    My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent,
    And, like a man to double 
business bound,
    I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
    And both neglect. What if this
 cursed hand
    Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,
    Is there not rain enough in th
e sweet heavens
    To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
    But to confront the visage 
of offence?
    And what's in prayer but this twofold force,
    To be forestalled ere we come to 
fall,
    Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;
    My fault is past. But, O, what form of pr
ayer
    Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murther'?
    That cannot be; since I am still pos
sess'd
    Of those effects for which I did the murther-
    My crown, mine own ambition, and my q
ueen.
    May one be pardon'd and retain th' offence?
    In the corrupted currents of this world

    Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,
    And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
   
 Buys out the law; but 'tis not so above.
    There is no shuffling; there the action lies
    In 
his true nature, and we ourselves compell'd,
    Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
   
 To give in evidence. What then? What rests?
    Try what repentance can. What can it not?
    Yet
 what can it when one cannot repent?
    O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
    O limed sou
l, that, struggling to be free,
    Art more engag'd! Help, angels! Make assay.
    Bow, stubborn 
knees; and heart with strings of steel,
    Be soft as sinews of the new-born babe!
    All may be
 well.                                  He kneels.

                         Enter Hamlet.

  Ha
m. Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
    And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven,
    
And so am I reveng'd. That would be scann'd.
    A villain kills my father; and for that,
    I, h
is sole son, do this same villain send
    To heaven.
    Why, this is hire and salary, not reveng
e!
    He took my father grossly, full of bread,
    With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as 
May;
    And how his audit stands, who knows save heaven?
    But in our circumstance and course o
f thought,
    'Tis heavy with him; and am I then reveng'd,
    To take him in the purging of his 
soul,
    When he is fit and seasoned for his passage?
    No.
    Up, sword, and know thou a mor
e horrid hent.
    When he is drunk asleep; or in his rage;
    Or in th' incestuous pleasure of h
is bed;
    At gaming, swearing, or about some act
    That has no relish of salvation in't-
    
Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,
    And that his soul may be as damn'd and black

    As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays.
    This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.      
        Exit.
  King. [rises] My words fly up, my thoughts remain below.
    Words without thought
s never to heaven go.             Exit.




Scene IV.
The Queen's closet.

Enter Queen and P
olonius.

  Pol. He will come straight. Look you lay home to him.
    Tell him his pranks have be
en too broad to bear with,
    And that your Grace hath screen'd and stood between
    Much heat a
nd him. I'll silence me even here.
    Pray you be round with him.
  Ham. (within) Mother, mother,
 mother!
  Queen. I'll warrant you; fear me not. Withdraw; I hear him
coming.
                   
           [Polonius hides behind the arras.]

                          Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. N
ow, mother, what's the matter?
  Queen. Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
  Ham. Mother,
 you have my father much offended.
  Queen. Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
  Ham. Go,
 go, you question with a wicked tongue.
  Queen. Why, how now, Hamlet?
  Ham. What's the matter no
w?
  Queen. Have you forgot me?
  Ham. No, by the rood, not so!
    You are the Queen, your husba
nd's brother's wife,
    And (would it were not so!) you are my mother.
  Queen. Nay, then I'll se
t those to you that can speak.
  Ham. Come, come, and sit you down. You shall not budge;
    You g
o not till I set you up a glass
    Where you may see the inmost part of you.
  Queen. What wilt t
hou do? Thou wilt not murther me?
    Help, help, ho!
  Pol. [behind] What, ho! help, help, help!

  Ham. [draws] How now? a rat? Dead for a ducat, dead!
            [Makes a pass through the arras
 and] kills Polonius.
  Pol. [behind] O, I am slain!
  Queen. O me, what hast thou done?
  Ham. N
ay, I know not. Is it the King?
  Queen. O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
  Ham. A bloody d
eed- almost as bad, good mother,
    As kill a king, and marry with his brother.
  Queen. As kill 
a king?
  Ham. Ay, lady, it was my word.
                         [Lifts up the arras and sees Pol
onius.]
    Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
    I took thee for thy better. Take th
y fortune.
    Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.
    Leave wringing of your hands. Peace
! sit you down
    And let me wring your heart; for so I shall
    If it be made of penetrable stu
ff;
    If damned custom have not braz'd it so
    That it is proof and bulwark against sense.
  
Queen. What have I done that thou dar'st wag thy tongue
    In noise so rude against me?
  Ham. Su
ch an act
    That blurs the grace and blush of modesty;
    Calls virtue hypocrite; takes off the
 rose
    From the fair forehead of an innocent love,
    And sets a blister there; makes marriage
 vows
    As false as dicers' oaths. O, such a deed
    As from the body of contraction plucks
  
  The very soul, and sweet religion makes
    A rhapsody of words! Heaven's face doth glow;
    Ye
a, this solidity and compound mass,
    With tristful visage, as against the doom,
    Is thought-
sick at the act.
  Queen. Ah me, what act,
    That roars so loud and thunders in the index?
  Ha
m. Look here upon th's picture, and on this,
    The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
    
See what a grace was seated on this brow;
    Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
    An 
eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
    A station like the herald Mercury
    New lighted on a
 heaven-kissing hill:
    A combination and a form indeed
    Where every god did seem to set his 
seal
    To give the world assurance of a man.
    This was your husband. Look you now what follow
s.
    Here is your husband, like a mildew'd ear
    Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes
?
    Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
    And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eye
s
    You cannot call it love; for at your age
    The heyday in the blood is tame, it's humble,

    And waits upon the judgment; and what judgment
    Would step from this to this? Sense sure you
 have,
    Else could you not have motion; but sure that sense
    Is apoplex'd; for madness would
 not err,
    Nor sense to ecstacy was ne'er so thrall'd
    But it reserv'd some quantity of choi
ce
    To serve in such a difference. What devil was't
    That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-b
lind?
    Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
    Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sa
ns all,
    Or but a sickly part of one true sense
    Could not so mope.
    O shame! where is t
hy blush? Rebellious hell,
    If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
    To flaming youth let 
virtue be as wax
    And melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame
    When the compulsive ardour gi
ves the charge,
    Since frost itself as actively doth burn,
    And reason panders will.
  Quee
n. O Hamlet, speak no more!
    Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul,
    And there I see such
 black and grained spots
    As will not leave their tinct.
  Ham. Nay, but to live
    In the ra
nk sweat of an enseamed bed,
    Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love
    Over the nasty
 sty!
  Queen. O, speak to me no more!
    These words like daggers enter in mine ears.
    No mo
re, sweet Hamlet!
  Ham. A murtherer and a villain!
    A slave that is not twentieth part the tit
he
    Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
    A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
    Th
at from a shelf the precious diadem stole
    And put it in his pocket!
  Queen. No more!

     
           Enter the Ghost in his nightgown.

  Ham. A king of shreds and patches!-
    Save me a
nd hover o'er me with your wings,
    You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?
  Quee
n. Alas, he's mad!
  Ham. Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
    That, laps'd in time and pa
ssion, lets go by
    Th' important acting of your dread command?
    O, say!
  Ghost. Do not for
get. This visitation
    Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
    But look, amazement on thy
 mother sits.
    O, step between her and her fighting soul
    Conceit in weakest bodies stronges
t works.
    Speak to her, Hamlet.
  Ham. How is it with you, lady?
  Queen. Alas, how is't with 
you,
    That you do bend your eye on vacancy,
    And with th' encorporal air do hold discourse?

    Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
    And, as the sleeping soldiers in th' alarm,

    Your bedded hairs, like life in excrements,
    Start up and stand an end. O gentle son,
    U
pon the heat and flame of thy distemper
    Sprinkle cool patience! Whereon do you look?
  Ham. On
 him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!
    His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,

    Would make them capable.- Do not look upon me,
    Lest with this piteous action you convert
 
   My stern effects. Then what I have to do
    Will want true colour- tears perchance for blood.

  Queen. To whom do you speak this?
  Ham. Do you see nothing there?
  Queen. Nothing at all; yet 
all that is I see.
  Ham. Nor did you nothing hear?
  Queen. No, nothing but ourselves.
  Ham. Wh
y, look you there! Look how it steals away!
    My father, in his habit as he liv'd!
    Look wher
e he goes even now out at the portal!
                                                     Exit Gho
st.
  Queen. This is the very coinage of your brain.
    This bodiless creation ecstasy
    Is ve
ry cunning in.
  Ham. Ecstasy?
    My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time
    And makes as 
healthful music. It is not madness
    That I have utt'red. Bring me to the test,
    And I the ma
tter will reword; which madness
    Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
    Lay not that
 flattering unction to your soul
    That not your trespass but my madness speaks.
    It will but
 skin and film the ulcerous place,
    Whiles rank corruption, mining all within,
    Infects unse
en. Confess yourself to heaven;
    Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
    And do not spre
ad the compost on the weeds
    To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;
    For in the fat
ness of these pursy times
    Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg-
    Yea, curb and woo for lea
ve to do him good.
  Queen. O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
  Ham. O, throw away the 
worser part of it,
    And live the purer with the other half,
    Good night- but go not to my un
cle's bed.
    Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
    That monster, custom, who all sense doth e
at
    Of habits evil, is angel yet in this,
    That to the use of actions fair and good
    He 
likewise gives a frock or livery,
    That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,
    And that shall l
end a kind of easiness
    To the next abstinence; the next more easy;
    For use almost can chan
ge the stamp of nature,
    And either [master] the devil, or throw him out
    With wondrous pote
ncy. Once more, good night;
    And when you are desirous to be blest,
    I'll blessing beg of yo
u.- For this same lord,
    I do repent; but heaven hath pleas'd it so,
    To punish me with this
, and this with me,
    That I must be their scourge and minister.
    I will bestow him, and will
 answer well
    The death I gave him. So again, good night.
    I must be cruel, only to be kind;

    Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.
    One word more, good lady.
  Queen. What shall
 I do?
  Ham. Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
    Let the bloat King tempt you again to 
bed;
    Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
    And let him, for a pair of reechy kis
ses,
    Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,
    Make you to ravel all this matter o
ut,
    That I essentially am not in madness,
    But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;

    For who that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
    Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib
  
  Such dear concernings hide? Who would do so?
    No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
    Unpeg 
the basket on the house's top,
    Let the birds fly, and like the famous ape,
    To try conclusi
ons, in the basket creep
    And break your own neck down.
  Queen. Be thou assur'd, if words be m
ade of breath,
    And breath of life, I have no life to breathe
    What thou hast said to me.
 
 Ham. I must to England; you know that?
  Queen. Alack,
    I had forgot! 'Tis so concluded on.
 
 Ham. There's letters seal'd; and my two schoolfellows,
    Whom I will trust as I will adders fang
'd,
    They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way
    And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;

    For 'tis the sport to have the enginer
    Hoist with his own petar; and 't shall go hard
   
 But I will delve one yard below their mines
    And blow them at the moon. O, 'tis most sweet
   
 When in one line two crafts directly meet.
    This man shall set me packing.
    I'll lug the gu
ts into the neighbour room.-
    Mother, good night.- Indeed, this counsellor
    Is now most stil
l, most secret, and most grave,
    Who was in life a foolish peating knave.
    Come, sir, to dra
w toward an end with you.
    Good night, mother.
                  [Exit the Queen. Then] Exit Ha
mlet, tugging in
                                                       Polonius.

ACT IV. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King and Queen, with Rosencrantz and 
Guildenstern.

  King. There's matter in these sighs. These profound heaves
    You must translat
e; 'tis fit we understand them.
    Where is your son?
  Queen. Bestow this place on us a little w
hile.
                          [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
    Ah, mine own lord, what
 have I seen to-night!
  King. What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
  Queen. Mad as the sea and wind w
hen both contend
    Which is the mightier. In his lawless fit
    Behind the arras hearing someth
ing stir,
    Whips out his rapier, cries 'A rat, a rat!'
    And in this brainish apprehension ki
lls
    The unseen good old man.
  King. O heavy deed!
    It had been so with us, had we been th
ere.
    His liberty is full of threats to all-
    To you yourself, to us, to every one.
    Ala
s, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
    It will be laid to us, whose providence
    Should 
have kept short, restrain'd, and out of haunt
    This mad young man. But so much was our love
   
 We would not understand what was most fit,
    But, like the owner of a foul disease,
    To keep
 it from divulging, let it feed
    Even on the pith of life. Where is he gone?
  Queen. To draw a
part the body he hath kill'd;
    O'er whom his very madness, like some ore
    Among a mineral of
 metals base,
    Shows itself pure. He weeps for what is done.
  King. O Gertrude, come away!
  
  The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch
    But we will ship him hence; and this vile deed
 
   We must with all our majesty and skill
    Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!

   
          Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

    Friends both, go join you with some further aid
.
    Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
    And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him.

    Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body
    Into the chapel. I pray you haste in this
.
                          Exeunt [Rosencrantz and Guildenstern].
    Come, Gertrude, we'll call 
up our wisest friends
    And let them know both what we mean to do
    And what's untimely done. 
[So haply slander-]
    Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter,
    As level as the cannon to his
 blank,
    Transports his poisoned shot- may miss our name
    And hit the woundless air.- O, com
e away!
    My soul is full of discord and dismay.
                                               
          Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A passage in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. 
Safely stow'd.
  Gentlemen. (within) Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!
  Ham. But soft! What noise? Who calls o
n Hamlet? O, here they
come.

               Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Ros. What h
ave you done, my lord, with the dead body?
  Ham. Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
  Ros
. Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
    And bear it to the chapel.
  Ham. Do not beli
eve it.
  Ros. Believe what?
  Ham. That I can keep your counsel, and not mine own. Besides,
to b
e
    demanded of a sponge, what replication should be made by the
son
    of a king?
  Ros. Tak
e you me for a sponge, my lord?
  Ham. Ay, sir; that soaks up the King's countenance, his
rewards,

    his authorities. But such officers do the King best service
in
    the end. He keeps them, l
ike an ape, in the corner of his
jaw;
    first mouth'd, to be last swallowed. When he needs what 
you
have
    glean'd, it is but squeezing you and, sponge, you shall be
dry
    again.
  Ros. I
 understand you not, my lord.
  Ham. I am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.
  
Ros. My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us
to
    the King.
  Ham. The body 
is with the King, but the King is not with the
body.
    The King is a thing-
  Guil. A thing, my
 lord?
  Ham. Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.
                              
                           Exeunt.




Scene III.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter Kin
g.

  King. I have sent to seek him and to find the body.
    How dangerous is it that this man g
oes loose!
    Yet must not we put the strong law on him.
    He's lov'd of the distracted multitu
de,
    Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;
    And where 'tis so, th' offender's scou
rge is weigh'd,
    But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,
    This sudden sending hi
m away must seem
    Deliberate pause. Diseases desperate grown
    By desperate appliance are rel
iev'd,
    Or not at all.

                    Enter Rosencrantz.

    How now O What hath befa
ll'n?
  Ros. Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
    We cannot get from him.
  King. But wh
ere is he?
  Ros. Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
  King. Bring him before us.

  Ros. Ho, Guildenstern! Bring in my lord.

        Enter Hamlet and Guildenstern [with Attendants
].

  King. Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
  Ham. At supper.
  King. At supper? Where?
  Ham. N
ot where he eats, but where he is eaten. A certain
    convocation of politic worms are e'en at him
. Your worm is
your
    only emperor for diet. We fat all creatures else to fat us,
and
    we f
at ourselves for maggots. Your fat king and your lean
beggar
    is but variable service- two dish
es, but to one table. That's
the
    end.
  King. Alas, alas!
  Ham. A man may fish with the wor
m that hath eat of a king, and
eat
    of the fish that hath fed of that worm.
  King. What dost 
thou mean by this?
  Ham. Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress
through
    the gu
ts of a beggar.
  King. Where is Polonius?
  Ham. In heaven. Send thither to see. If your messenge
r find him
not
    there, seek him i' th' other place yourself. But indeed, if
you
    find him 
not within this month, you shall nose him as you go
up
    the stair, into the lobby.
  King. Go 
seek him there. [To Attendants.]
  Ham. He will stay till you come.
                              
              [Exeunt Attendants.]
  King. Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,-
    Whic
h we do tender as we dearly grieve
    For that which thou hast done,- must send thee hence
    Wi
th fiery quickness. Therefore prepare thyself.
    The bark is ready and the wind at help,
    Th'
 associates tend, and everything is bent
    For England.
  Ham. For England?
  King. Ay, Hamlet.

  Ham. Good.
  King. So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
  Ham. I see a cherub that sees the
m. But come, for England!
    Farewell, dear mother.
  King. Thy loving father, Hamlet.
  Ham. My
 mother! Father and mother is man and wife; man and wife
is
    one flesh; and so, my mother. Come
, for England!
Exit.
  King. Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard.
    Delay it not; I
'll have him hence to-night.
    Away! for everything is seal'd and done
    That else leans on th
' affair. Pray you make haste.
                            Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]
  
  And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught,-
    As my great power thereof may give thee sens
e,
    Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
    After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
   
 Pays homage to us,- thou mayst not coldly set
    Our sovereign process, which imports at full,
 
   By letters congruing to that effect,
    The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;
    For l
ike the hectic in my blood he rages,
    And thou must cure me. Till I know 'tis done,
    Howe'er
 my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.             Exit.

Scene IV.
Near Elsinore.


Enter Fortinbras with his Army over the stage.

  For. Go, Captain, from me greet the Danish k
ing.
    Tell him that by his license Fortinbras
    Craves the conveyance of a promis'd march
  
  Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.
    If that his Majesty would aught with us,
    We s
hall express our duty in his eye;
    And let him know so.
  Capt. I will do't, my lord.
  For. G
o softly on.
                                   Exeunt [all but the Captain].

       Enter Hamle
t, Rosencrantz, [Guildenstern,] and others.

  Ham. Good sir, whose powers are these?
  Capt. The
y are of Norway, sir.
  Ham. How purpos'd, sir, I pray you?
  Capt. Against some part of Poland.

  Ham. Who commands them, sir?
  Capt. The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.
  Ham. Goes it agains
t the main of Poland, sir,
    Or for some frontier?
  Capt. Truly to speak, and with no addition,

    We go to gain a little patch of ground
    That hath in it no profit but the name.
    To pa
y five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
    Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
    A ranker
 rate, should it be sold in fee.
  Ham. Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
  Capt. Yes, it
 is already garrison'd.
  Ham. Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
    Will not debate t
he question of this straw.
    This is th' imposthume of much wealth and peace,
    That inward br
eaks, and shows no cause without
    Why the man dies.- I humbly thank you, sir.
  Capt. God b' wi
' you, sir.                             [Exit.]
  Ros. Will't please you go, my lord?
  Ham. I'll 
be with you straight. Go a little before.
                                        [Exeunt all but H
amlet.]
    How all occasions do inform against me
    And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
 
   If his chief good and market of his time
    Be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.
    Su
re he that made us with such large discourse,
    Looking before and after, gave us not
    That c
apability and godlike reason
    To fust in us unus'd. Now, whether it be
    Bestial oblivion, or
 some craven scruple
    Of thinking too precisely on th' event,-
    A thought which, quarter'd, 
hath but one part wisdom
    And ever three parts coward,- I do not know
    Why yet I live to say
 'This thing's to do,'
    Sith I have cause, and will, and strength, and means
    To do't. Examp
les gross as earth exhort me.
    Witness this army of such mass and charge,
    Led by a delicate
 and tender prince,
    Whose spirit, with divine ambition puff'd,
    Makes mouths at the invisib
le event,
    Exposing what is mortal and unsure
    To all that fortune, death, and danger dare,

    Even for an eggshell. Rightly to be great
    Is not to stir without great argument,
    But 
greatly to find quarrel in a straw
    When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,
    That have
 a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,
    Excitements of my reason and my blood,
    And let all sle
ep, while to my shame I see
    The imminent death of twenty thousand men
    That for a fantasy a
nd trick of fame
    Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot
    Whereon the numbers cannot
 try the cause,
    Which is not tomb enough and continent
    To hide the slain? O, from this tim
e forth,
    My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!            Exit.

Scen
e V.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter Horatio, Queen, and a Gentleman.

  Queen. I will n
ot speak with her.
  Gent. She is importunate, indeed distract.
    Her mood will needs be pitied.

  Queen. What would she have?
  Gent. She speaks much of her father; says she hears
    There's 
tricks i' th' world, and hems, and beats her heart;
    Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things i
n doubt,
    That carry but half sense. Her speech is nothing,
    Yet the unshaped use of it doth
 move
    The hearers to collection; they aim at it,
    And botch the words up fit to their own t
houghts;
    Which, as her winks and nods and gestures yield them,
    Indeed would make one think
 there might be thought,
    Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
  Hor. 'Twere good she were 
spoken with; for she may strew
    Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.
  Queen. Let her c
ome in.
                                               [Exit Gentleman.]
    [Aside] To my sick so
ul (as sin's true nature is)
    Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
    So full of artle
ss jealousy is guilt
    It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.

                 Enter Ophelia
 distracted.

  Oph. Where is the beauteous Majesty of Denmark?
  Queen. How now, Ophelia?
  Oph
. (sings)
         How should I your true-love know
           From another one?
         By his 
cockle bat and' staff
           And his sandal shoon.

  Queen. Alas, sweet lady, what imports t
his song?
  Oph. Say you? Nay, pray You mark.

    (Sings) He is dead and gone, lady,
          
    He is dead and gone;
            At his head a grass-green turf,
              At his heels a 
stone.

    O, ho!
  Queen. Nay, but Ophelia-
  Oph. Pray you mark.

    (Sings) White his shr
oud as the mountain snow-

                    Enter King.

  Queen. Alas, look here, my lord!

  Oph. (Sings)
           Larded all with sweet flowers;
         Which bewept to the grave did no
t go
           With true-love showers.

  King. How do you, pretty lady?
  Oph. Well, God dild 
you! They say the owl was a baker's
daughter.
    Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we 
may be. God
be at
    your table!
  King. Conceit upon her father.
  Oph. Pray let's have no wor
ds of this; but when they ask, you
what
    it means, say you this:

    (Sings) To-morrow is Sa
int Valentine's day,
              All in the morning bedtime,
            And I a maid at your wi
ndow,
              To be your Valentine.

            Then up he rose and donn'd his clo'es
   
           And dupp'd the chamber door,
            Let in the maid, that out a maid
             
 Never departed more.

  King. Pretty Ophelia!
  Oph. Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an e
nd on't!

    [Sings] By Gis and by Saint Charity,
              Alack, and fie for shame!
     
       Young men will do't if they come to't
              By Cock, they are to blame.

         
   Quoth she, 'Before you tumbled me,
              You promis'd me to wed.'

    He answers:


            'So would I 'a' done, by yonder sun,
              An thou hadst not come to my bed.'


  King. How long hath she been thus?
  Oph. I hope all will be well. We must be patient; but I ca
nnot
    choose but weep to think they would lay him i' th' cold
ground.
    My brother shall kno
w of it; and so I thank you for your good
    counsel. Come, my coach! Good night, ladies. Good nig
ht,
sweet
    ladies. Good night, good night.                         Exit
  King. Follow her clo
se; give her good watch, I pray you.
                                                 [Exit Horatio
.]

    O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs
    All from her father's death. O Gertru
de, Gertrude,
    When sorrows come, they come not single spies.
    But in battalions! First, her
 father slain;
    Next, your son gone, and he most violent author
    Of his own just remove; the
 people muddied,
    Thick and and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers
    For good Poloniu
s' death, and we have done but greenly
    In hugger-mugger to inter him; poor Ophelia
    Divided
 from herself and her fair judgment,
    Without the which we are pictures or mere beasts;
    Las
t, and as much containing as all these,
    Her brother is in secret come from France;
    And wan
ts not buzzers to infect his ear
    Feeds on his wonder, keep, himself in clouds,
    With pestil
ent speeches of his father's death,
    Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
    Will nothing st
ick our person to arraign
    In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
    Like to a murd'ring pi
ece, in many places
    Give me superfluous death.                  A noise within.
  Queen. Alack
, what noise is this?
  King. Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.

                  
   Enter a Messenger.

    What is the matter?
  Mess. Save Yourself, my lord:
    The ocean, ov
erpeering of his list,
    Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
    Than Young Laertes, in
 a riotous head,
    O'erbears Your offices. The rabble call him lord;
    And, as the world were 
now but to begin,
    Antiquity forgot, custom not known,
    The ratifiers and props of every wor
d,
    They cry 'Choose we! Laertes shall be king!'
    Caps, hands, and tongues applaud it to the
 clouds,
    'Laertes shall be king! Laertes king!'
                                              
   A noise within.
  Queen. How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!
    O, this is counter, yo
u false Danish dogs!
  King. The doors are broke.

                    Enter Laertes with others.


  Laer. Where is this king?- Sirs, staid you all without.
  All. No, let's come in!
  Laer. I 
pray you give me leave.
  All. We will, we will!
  Laer. I thank you. Keep the door.      [Exeunt 
his Followers.]
    O thou vile king,
    Give me my father!
  Queen. Calmly, good Laertes.
  La
er. That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard;
    Cries cuckold to my father; brands the
 harlot
    Even here between the chaste unsmirched brows
    Of my true mother.
  King. What is 
the cause, Laertes,
    That thy rebellion looks so giantlike?
    Let him go, Gertrude. Do not fe
ar our person.
    There's such divinity doth hedge a king
    That treason can but peep to what i
t would,
    Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,
    Why thou art thus incens'd. Let him go
, Gertrude.
    Speak, man.
  Laer. Where is my father?
  King. Dead.
  Queen. But not by him!

  King. Let him demand his fill.
  Laer. How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
    To hell, 
allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil
    Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
    I da
re damnation. To this point I stand,
    That both the world, I give to negligence,
    Let come w
hat comes; only I'll be reveng'd
    Most throughly for my father.
  King. Who shall stay you?
  
Laer. My will, not all the world!
    And for my means, I'll husband them so well
    They shall g
o far with little.
  King. Good Laertes,
    If you desire to know the certainty
    Of your dear
 father's death, is't writ in your revenge
    That sweepstake you will draw both friend and foe,

    Winner and loser?
  Laer. None but his enemies.
  King. Will you know them then?
  Laer. To h
is good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms
    And, like the kind life-rend'ring pelican,
    Repa
st them with my blood.
  King. Why, now You speak
    Like a good child and a true gentleman.
   
 That I am guiltless of your father's death,
    And am most sensibly in grief for it,
    It shal
l as level to your judgment pierce
    As day does to your eye.
                              A no
ise within: 'Let her come in.'
  Laer. How now? What noise is that?

                      Enter 
Ophelia.

    O heat, dry up my brains! Tears seven times salt
    Burn out the sense and virtue 
of mine eye!
    By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight
    Till our scale turn the beam. 
O rose of May!
    Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
    O heavens! is't possible a young mai
d's wits
    Should be as mortal as an old man's life?
    Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis 
fine,
    It sends some precious instance of itself
    After the thing it loves.

  Oph. (sings
)
         They bore him barefac'd on the bier
           (Hey non nony, nony, hey nony)
        
 And in his grave rain'd many a tear.

    Fare you well, my dove!
  Laer. Hadst thou thy wits, a
nd didst persuade revenge,
    It could not move thus.
  Oph. You must sing 'A-down a-down, and yo
u call him a-down-a.'
O,
    how the wheel becomes it! It is the false steward, that stole
his
 
   master's daughter.
  Laer. This nothing's more than matter.
  Oph. There's rosemary, that's for
 remembrance. Pray you, love,
    remember. And there is pansies, that's for thoughts.
  Laer. A d
ocument in madness! Thoughts and remembrance fitted.
  Oph. There's fennel for you, and columbines.
 There's rue for
you,
    and here's some for me. We may call it herb of grace o'
Sundays.
    O
, you must wear your rue with a difference! There's a daisy.
I
    would give you some violets, bu
t they wither'd all when my
father
    died. They say he made a good end.

    [Sings] For bonny
 sweet Robin is all my joy.

  Laer. Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,
    She turns 
to favour and to prettiness.
  Oph. (sings)
         And will he not come again?
         And wil
l he not come again?
           No, no, he is dead;
           Go to thy deathbed;
         He ne
ver will come again.

         His beard was as white as snow,
         All flaxen was his poll.

           He is gone, he is gone,
           And we cast away moan.
         God 'a'mercy on his
 soul!

    And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God b' wi' you.
Exit.
  Laer. Do you see thi
s, O God?
  King. Laertes, I must commune with your grief,
    Or you deny me right. Go but apart,

    Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will,
    And they shall hear and judge 'twixt yo
u and me.
    If by direct or by collateral hand
    They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom giv
e,
    Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours,
    To you in satisfaction; but if not,
  
  Be you content to lend your patience to us,
    And we shall jointly labour with your soul
    T

  Laer. Let this be so.
    His means of death, his obscure funeral-
    N
o trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,
    No noble rite nor formal ostentation,-
    Cry 
to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
    That I must call't in question.
  King. So you sh
all;
    And where th' offence is let the great axe fall.
    I pray you go with me.

Enter Horatio with an Attendant.

  Hor. What are they that would speak

  Sailor. God bless you, sir.
  Hor. Let him bless thee too.

    sir,- it comes from th' ambassador that was boun

England- if
    your name be Horatio, as I am let to know it is.
  Hor. (reads the letter) 
'Horatio, when thou shalt have
overlook'd
    this, give these fellows some means to the King. The
y have
    letters for him. Ere we were two days old at sea, a pirate of

    very warlike appoin

    slow of sail, we put on a compelled valour, and in t
he
grapple I
    boarded them. On the instant they got clear of our ship; so I
    alone became t
heir prisoner. They have dealt with me like
thieves
    of mercy; but they knew what they did: I a
m to do a good turn
for
    them. Let the King have the letters I have sent, and repair
thou
   
 to me with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death. I have
words
    to speak in thine ear will m
ake thee dumb; yet are they much
too
    light for the bore of the matter. These good fellows will

bring
    thee where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their
course
    for England. Of t
hem I have much to tell thee. Farewell.
                            'He that thou knowest thine, HA
MLET.'

    Come, I will give you way for these your letters,
    And do't the speedier that you 
may direct me
    To him from whom you brought them.                   Exeunt.

Scene VII.
Elsinore. Another room in the Castle.

Enter King and Laertes.

  King. Now must yo
ur conscience my acquittance seal,
    And You must put me in your heart for friend,
    Sith you 
have heard, and with a knowing ear,
    That he which hath your noble father slain
    Pursued my 
life.
  Laer. It well appears. But tell me
    Why you proceeded not against these feats
    So c
rimeful and so capital in nature,
    As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
    You mainly w
ere stirr'd up.
  King. O, for two special reasons,
    Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsin
ew'd,
    But yet to me they are strong. The Queen his mother
    Lives almost by his looks; and f
or myself,-
    My virtue or my plague, be it either which,-
    She's so conjunctive to my life a
nd soul
    That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
    I could not but by her. The other m
otive
    Why to a public count I might not go
    Is the great love the general gender bear him,

    Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
    Would, like the spring that turneth wood t
o stone,
    Convert his gives to graces; so that my arrows,
    Too slightly timber'd for so loud
 a wind,
    Would have reverted to my bow again,
    And not where I had aim'd them.
  Laer. And
 so have I a noble father lost;
    A sister driven into desp'rate terms,
    Whose worth, if prai
ses may go back again,
    Stood challenger on mount of all the age
    For her perfections. But m
y revenge will come.
  King. Break not your sleeps for that. You must not think
    That we are ma
de of stuff so flat and dull
    That we can let our beard be shook with danger,
    And think it 
pastime. You shortly shall hear more.
    I lov'd your father, and we love ourself,
    And that, 
I hope, will teach you to imagine-

                 Enter a Messenger with letters.

    How no
w? What news?
  Mess. Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:
    This to your Majesty; this to the Queen.

  King. From Hamlet? Who brought them?
  Mess. Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not.
    Th
ey were given me by Claudio; he receiv'd them
    Of him that brought them.
  King. Laertes, you s
hall hear them.
    Leave us.
                                                 Exit Messenger.
  
  [Reads]'High and Mighty,-You shall know I am set naked on
your
    kingdom. To-morrow shall I be
g leave to see your kingly eyes;
    when I shall (first asking your pardon thereunto) recount the

    occasion of my sudden and more strange return.
                                               
      'HAMLET.'
    What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?
    Or is it some abuse, an
d no such thing?
  Laer. Know you the hand?
  King. 'Tis Hamlet's character. 'Naked!'
    And in 
a postscript here, he says 'alone.'
    Can you advise me?
  Laer. I am lost in it, my lord. But l
et him come!
    It warms the very sickness in my heart
    That I shall live and tell him to his 
teeth,
    'Thus didest thou.'
  King. If it be so, Laertes
    (As how should it be so? how othe
rwise?),
    Will you be rul'd by me?
  Laer. Ay my lord,
    So you will not o'errule me to a pe
ace.
  King. To thine own peace. If he be now return'd
    As checking at his voyage, and that he 
means
    No more to undertake it, I will work him
    To exploit now ripe in my device,
    Unde
r the which he shall not choose but fall;
    And for his death no wind shall breathe
    But even
 his mother shall uncharge the practice
    And call it accident.
  Laer. My lord, I will be rul'd
;
    The rather, if you could devise it so
    That I might be the organ.
  King. It falls right
.
    You have been talk'd of since your travel much,
    And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a qual
ity
    Wherein they say you shine, Your sum of parts
    Did not together pluck such envy from hi
m
    As did that one; and that, in my regard,
    Of the unworthiest siege.
  Laer. What part is
 that, my lord?
  King. A very riband in the cap of youth-
    Yet needfull too; for youth no less
 becomes
    The light and careless livery that it wears
    Than settled age his sables and his w
eeds,
    Importing health and graveness. Two months since
    Here was a gentleman of Normandy.

    I have seen myself, and serv'd against, the French,
    And they can well on horseback; but thi
s gallant
    Had witchcraft in't. He grew unto his seat,
    And to such wondrous doing brought h
is horse
    As had he been incorps'd and demi-natur'd
    With the brave beast. So far he topp'd 
my thought
    That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
    Come short of what he did.
  Laer. A 
Norman was't?
  King. A Norman.
  Laer. Upon my life, Lamound.
  King. The very same.
  Laer. I 
know him well. He is the broach indeed
    And gem of all the nation.
  King. He made confession o
f you;
    And gave you such a masterly report
    For art and exercise in your defence,
    And 
for your rapier most especially,
    That he cried out 'twould be a sight indeed
    If one could 
match you. The scrimers of their nation
    He swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
    If yo
u oppos'd them. Sir, this report of his
    Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
    That he could 
nothing do but wish and beg
    Your sudden coming o'er to play with you.
    Now, out of this-
 
 Laer. What out of this, my lord?
  King. Laertes, was your father dear to you?
    Or are you lik
e the painting of a sorrow,
    A face without a heart,'
  Laer. Why ask you this?
  King. Not th
at I think you did not love your father;
    But that I know love is begun by time,
    And that I
 see, in passages of proof,
    Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
    There lives within th
e very flame of love
    A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
    And nothing is at a like 
goodness still;
    For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
    Dies in his own too-much. That we woul
d do,
    We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes,
    And hath abatements and delays
 as many
    As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
    And then this 'should' is like a 
spendthrift sigh,
    That hurts by easing. But to the quick o' th' ulcer!
    Hamlet comes back. 
What would you undertake
    To show yourself your father's son in deed
    More than in words?
 
 Laer. To cut his throat i' th' church!
  King. No place indeed should murther sanctuarize;
    Re
venge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,
    Will you do this? Keep close within your chambe
r.
    Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home.
    We'll put on those shall praise your exce
llence
    And set a double varnish on the fame
    The Frenchman gave you; bring you in fine toge
ther
    And wager on your heads. He, being remiss,
    Most generous, and free from all contrivin
g,
    Will not peruse the foils; so that with ease,
    Or with a little shuffling, you may choos
e
    A sword unbated, and, in a pass of practice,
    Requite him for your father.
  Laer. I wil
l do't!
    And for that purpose I'll anoint my sword.
    I bought an unction of a mountebank,
 
   So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
    Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
    Colle
cted from all simples that have virtue
    Under the moon, can save the thing from death
    This 
is but scratch'd withal. I'll touch my point
    With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,

    It may be death.
  King. Let's further think of this,
    Weigh what convenience both of tim
e and means
    May fit us to our shape. If this should fall,
    And that our drift look through 
our bad performance.
    'Twere better not assay'd. Therefore this project
    Should have a back 
or second, that might hold
    If this did blast in proof. Soft! let me see.
    We'll make a sole
mn wager on your cunnings-
    I ha't!
    When in your motion you are hot and dry-
    As make y
our bouts more violent to that end-
    And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepar'd him
    A 
chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,
    If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
    Our
 purpose may hold there.- But stay, what noise,

                           Enter Queen.

    Ho
w now, sweet queen?
  Queen. One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
    So fast they follow. Your
 sister's drown'd, Laertes.
  Laer. Drown'd! O, where?
  Queen. There is a willow grows aslant a b
rook,
    That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream.
    There with fantastic garlands did s
he come
    Of crowflowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,
    That liberal shepherds give a 
grosser name,
    But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them.
    There on the pendant bou
ghs her coronet weeds
    Clamb'ring to hang, an envious sliver broke,
    When down her weedy tro
phies and herself
    Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide
    And, mermaid-like, aw
hile they bore her up;
    Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes,
    As one incapable of 
her own distress,
    Or like a creature native and indued
    Unto that element; but long it coul
d not be
    Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
    Pull'd the poor wretch from her m
elodious lay
    To muddy death.
  Laer. Alas, then she is drown'd?
  Queen. Drown'd, drown'd.
 
 Laer. Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
    And therefore I forbid my tears; but yet
   
 It is our trick; nature her custom holds,
    Let shame say what it will. When these are gone,
  
  The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord.
    I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze
    Bu
t that this folly douts it.                          Exit.
  King. Let's follow, Gertrude.
    How
 much I had to do to calm his rage I
    Now fear I this will give it start again;
    Therefore l
et's follow.
                                                         Exeunt.

ACT V. Scene I.
Elsinore. A churchyard.

Enter two Clowns, [with spades and pickaxes].

  Clown
. Is she to be buried in Christian burial when she
wilfully
    seeks her own salvation?
  Other.
 I tell thee she is; therefore make her grave straight.
    The crowner hath sate on her, and finds
 it Christian burial.
  Clown. How can that be, unless she drown'd herself in her own
    defence?

  Other. Why, 'tis found so.
  Clown. It must be se offendendo; it cannot be else. For here
lies

    the point: if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act; and
an
    act hath three branches
-it is to act, to do, and to perform;
    argal, she drown'd herself wittingly.
  Other. Nay, but 
hear you, Goodman Delver!
  Clown. Give me leave. Here lies the water; good. Here stands
the
    
man; good. If the man go to this water and drown himself, it
is,
    will he nill he, he goes- mar
k you that. But if the water
come to
    him and drown him, he drowns not himself. Argal, he that 
is
not
    guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.
  Other. But is this law?
  Clown.
 Ay, marry, is't- crowner's quest law.
  Other. Will you ha' the truth an't? If this had not been a

    gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o' Christian
burial.
  Clown. Why, there thou s
ay'st! And the more pity that great
folk
    should have count'nance in this world to drown or han
g
themselves
    more than their even-Christian. Come, my spade! There is no
    ancient gentleme
n but gard'ners, ditchers, and grave-makers.
They
    hold up Adam's profession.
  Other. Was he 
a gentleman?
  Clown. 'A was the first that ever bore arms.
  Other. Why, he had none.
  Clown. W
hat, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the
Scripture?
    The Scripture says Adam digg'd. Co
uld he dig without arms?
I'll
    put another question to thee. If thou answerest me not to the
 
   purpose, confess thyself-
  Other. Go to!
  Clown. What is he that builds stronger than either 
the mason,
the
    shipwright, or the carpenter?
  Other. The gallows-maker; for that frame outli
ves a thousand
    tenants.
  Clown. I like thy wit well, in good faith. The gallows does
well.

    But how does it well? It does well to those that do ill. Now,
    thou dost ill to say the gall
ows is built stronger than the
    church. Argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To't again,
com
e!
  Other. Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a
    carpenter?
  Clown. Ay, tell
 me that, and unyoke.
  Other. Marry, now I can tell!
  Clown. To't.
  Other. Mass, I cannot tell
.

                 Enter Hamlet and Horatio afar off.

  Clown. Cudgel thy brains no more about
 it, for your dull ass
will
    not mend his pace with beating; and when you are ask'd this
    q
uestion next, say 'a grave-maker.' The houses he makes lasts
    till doomsday. Go, get thee to Yau
ghan; fetch me a stoup of
    liquor.
                                            [Exit Second Clo
wn.]


                       [Clown digs and] sings.

       In youth when I did love, did lov
e,
         Methought it was very sweet;
       To contract- O- the time for- a- my behove,
     
    O, methought there- a- was nothing- a- meet.

  Ham. Has this fellow no feeling of his busines
s, that he sings
at
    grave-making?
  Hor. Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.

  Ham. 'Tis e'en so. The hand of little employment hath the
daintier
    sense.
  Clown. (sings)

         But age with his stealing steps
           Hath clawed me in his clutch,
         And ha
th shipped me intil the land,
           As if I had never been such.
                            
                [Throws up a skull.]

  Ham. That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once. H
ow
the
    knave jowls it to the ground,as if 'twere Cain's jawbone,
that
    did the first murt
her! This might be the pate of a
Politician,
    which this ass now o'erreaches; one that would ci
rcumvent
God,
    might it not?
  Hor. It might, my lord.
  Ham. Or of a courtier, which could s
ay 'Good morrow, sweet
lord!
    How dost thou, good lord?' This might be my Lord Such-a-one,
tha
t
    prais'd my Lord Such-a-one's horse when he meant to beg it-
might
    it not?
  Hor. Ay, m
y lord.
  Ham. Why, e'en so! and now my Lady Worm's, chapless, and
knock'd
    about the mazzard 
with a sexton's spade. Here's fine
revolution,
    and we had the trick to see't. Did these bones 
cost no more
the
    breeding but to play at loggets with 'em? Mine ache to think
    on't.
  Cl
own. (Sings)
         A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,
           For and a shrouding sheet;
     
    O, a Pit of clay for to be made
           For such a guest is meet.
                         
             Throws up [another skull].

  Ham. There's another. Why may not that be the skull of 
a
lawyer?
    Where be his quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, his
tenures,
    and his trick
s? Why does he suffer this rude knave now to
knock
    him about the sconce with a dirty shovel, a
nd will not tell
him
    of his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be in's time
a
    gre
at buyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizances,
his
    fines, his double vouchers, his re
coveries. Is this the fine
of
    his fines, and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his
fine

    pate full of fine dirt? Will his vouchers vouch him no more
of
    his purchases, and double
 ones too, than the length and
breadth
    of a pair of indentures? The very conveyances of his la
nds
will
    scarcely lie in this box; and must th' inheritor himself have
no
    more, ha?
  H
or. Not a jot more, my lord.
  Ham. Is not parchment made of sheepskins?
  Hor. Ay, my lord, And o
f calveskins too.
  Ham. They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in
that. I
    will s
peak to this fellow. Whose grave's this, sirrah?
  Clown. Mine, sir.

    [Sings] O, a pit of cla
y for to be made
              For such a guest is meet.

  Ham. I think it be thine indeed, for 
thou liest in't.
  Clown. You lie out on't, sir, and therefore 'tis not yours.
    For my part, I 
do not lie in't, yet it is mine.
  Ham. Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine. 'Tis
f
or
    the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.
  Clown. 'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill a
way again from me to you.
  Ham. What man dost thou dig it for?
  Clown. For no man, sir.
  Ham. 
What woman then?
  Clown. For none neither.
  Ham. Who is to be buried in't?
  Clown. One that wa
s a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's
dead.
  Ham. How absolute the knave is! We must speak by
 the card, or
    equivocation will undo us. By the Lord, Horatio, this three
years
    I have ta
ken note of it, the age is grown so picked that the
toe
    of the peasant comes so near the heel 
of the courtier he
galls
    his kibe.- How long hast thou been a grave-maker?
  Clown. Of all th
e days i' th' year, I came to't that day that
our
    last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.
  Ham
. How long is that since?
  Clown. Cannot you tell that? Every fool can tell that. It was
the
   
 very day that young Hamlet was born- he that is mad, and sent
    into England.
  Ham. Ay, marry,
 why was be sent into England?
  Clown. Why, because 'a was mad. 'A shall recover his wits
there;

    or, if 'a do not, 'tis no great matter there.
  Ham. Why?
  Clown. 'Twill not he seen in him 
there. There the men are as
mad as
    he.
  Ham. How came he mad?
  Clown. Very strangely, they
 say.
  Ham. How strangely?
  Clown. Faith, e'en with losing his wits.
  Ham. Upon what ground?

  Clown. Why, here in Denmark. I have been sexton here, man and
boy
    thirty years.
  Ham. How 
long will a man lie i' th' earth ere he rot?
  Clown. Faith, if 'a be not rotten before 'a die (as 
we have
many
    pocky corses now-a-days that will scarce hold the laying in,
I
    will last yo
u some eight year or nine year. A tanner will
last
    you nine year.
  Ham. Why he more than ano
ther?
  Clown. Why, sir, his hide is so tann'd with his trade that 'a
will
    keep out water a g
reat while; and your water is a sore
decayer of
    your whoreson dead body. Here's a skull now. T
his skull hath
lien
    you i' th' earth three-and-twenty years.
  Ham. Whose was it?
  Clown. A
 whoreson, mad fellow's it was. Whose do you think it
was?
  Ham. Nay, I know not.
  Clown. A pes
tilence on him for a mad rogue! 'A pour'd a flagon
of
    Rhenish on my head once. This same skull
, sir, was Yorick's
    skull, the King's jester.
  Ham. This?
  Clown. E'en that.
  Ham. Let me
 see. [Takes the skull.] Alas, poor Yorick! I knew
him,
    Horatio. A fellow of infinite jest, of
 most excellent fancy.
He
    hath borne me on his back a thousand times. And now how
abhorred
 
   in my imagination it is! My gorge rises at it. Here hung
those
    lips that I have kiss'd I kn
ow not how oft. Where be your
gibes
    now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment t
hat
    were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock
your
    own grinning? Quite c
hap- fall'n? Now get you to my lady's
    chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to th
is
    favour she must come. Make her laugh at that. Prithee,
Horatio,
    tell me one thing.
  
Hor. What's that, my lord?
  Ham. Dost thou think Alexander look'd o' this fashion i' th'
earth?

  Hor. E'en so.
  Ham. And smelt so? Pah!
                                          [Puts down the
 skull.]
  Hor. E'en so, my lord.
  Ham. To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not
  
  imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it
    stopping a bunghole?
  Hor. 'T
were to consider too curiously, to consider so.
  Ham. No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thit
her with
modesty
    enough, and likelihood to lead it; as thus: Alexander died,
    Alexander wa
s buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust
is
    earth; of earth we make loam; and why of 
that loam (whereto
he
    was converted) might they not stop a beer barrel?
    Imperious Caesar,
 dead and turn'd to clay,
    Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.
    O, that that earth whic
h kept the world in awe
    Should patch a wall t' expel the winter's flaw!
    But soft! but soft
! aside! Here comes the King-

    Enter [priests with] a coffin [in funeral procession], King,
 
            Queen, Laertes, with Lords attendant.]

    The Queen, the courtiers. Who is this they
 follow?
    And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken
    The corse they follow did with desp
'rate hand
    Fordo it own life. 'Twas of some estate.
    Couch we awhile, and mark.
          
                               [Retires with Horatio.]

  Laer. What ceremony else?
  Ham. That i
s Laertes,
    A very noble youth. Mark.
  Laer. What ceremony else?
  Priest. Her obsequies have
 been as far enlarg'd
    As we have warranty. Her death was doubtful;
    And, but that great com
mand o'ersways the order,
    She should in ground unsanctified have lodg'd
    Till the last trum
pet. For charitable prayers,
    Shards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on her.
    Yet here
 she is allow'd her virgin rites,
    Her maiden strewments, and the bringing home
    Of bell and
 burial.
  Laer. Must there no more be done?
  Priest. No more be done.
    We should profane the
 service of the dead
    To sing a requiem and such rest to her
    As to peace-parted souls.
  L
aer. Lay her i' th' earth;
    And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
    May violets spring! I te
ll thee, churlish priest,
    A minist'ring angel shall my sister be
    When thou liest howling.

  Ham. What, the fair Ophelia?
  Queen. Sweets to the sweet! Farewell.
                          
                   [Scatters flowers.]
    I hop'd thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
    I
 thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
    And not have strew'd thy grave.
  Laer. O, 
treble woe
    Fall ten times treble on that cursed head
    Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious 
sense
    Depriv'd thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,
    Till I have caught her once more in min
e arms.
                                             Leaps in the grave.
    Now pile your dust up
on the quick and dead
    Till of this flat a mountain you have made
    T' o'ertop old Pelion or 
the skyish head
    Of blue Olympus.
  Ham. [comes forward] What is he whose grief
    Bears such
 an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow
    Conjures the wand'ring stars, and makes them stand
    Li
ke wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,
    Hamlet the Dane.                    [Leaps in after Laert
es.
  Laer. The devil take thy soul!
                                            [Grapples with hi
m].
  Ham. Thou pray'st not well.
    I prithee take thy fingers from my throat;
    For, though 
I am not splenitive and rash,
    Yet have I in me something dangerous,
    Which let thy wisdom f
ear. Hold off thy hand!
  King. Pluck them asunder.
  Queen. Hamlet, Hamlet!
  All. Gentlemen!
 
 Hor. Good my lord, be quiet.
             [The Attendants part them, and they come out of the
   
                                                      grave.]
  Ham. Why, I will fight with him upo
n this theme
    Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
  Queen. O my son, what theme?
  Ham. I lov
'd Ophelia. Forty thousand brothers
    Could not (with all their quantity of love)
    Make up my
 sum. What wilt thou do for her?
  King. O, he is mad, Laertes.
  Queen. For love of God, forbear 
him!
  Ham. 'Swounds, show me what thou't do.
    Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear 
thyself?
    Woo't drink up esill? eat a crocodile?
    I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?

    To outface me with leaping in her grave?
    Be buried quick with her, and so will I.
    And 
if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
    Millions of acres on us, till our ground,
    Singe
ing his pate against the burning zone,
    Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
    I'll 
rant as well as thou.
  Queen. This is mere madness;
    And thus a while the fit will work on him
.
    Anon, as patient as the female dove
    When that her golden couplets are disclos'd,
    Hi
s silence will sit drooping.
  Ham. Hear you, sir!
    What is the reason that you use me thus?
 
   I lov'd you ever. But it is no matter.
    Let Hercules himself do what he may,
    The cat wil
l mew, and dog will have his day.
Exit.
  King. I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.
       
                                            Exit Horatio.
    [To Laertes] Strengthen your patience
 in our last night's
speech.
    We'll put the matter to the present push.-
    Good Gertrude, se
t some watch over your son.-
    This grave shall have a living monument.
    An hour of quiet sho
rtly shall we see;
    Till then in patience our proceeding be.
                                  
                       Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A hall in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet a
nd Horatio.

  Ham. So much for this, sir; now shall you see the other.
    You do remember all t
he circumstance?
  Hor. Remember it, my lord!
  Ham. Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting

    That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay
    Worse than the mutinies in the bilboes. Rash
ly-
    And prais'd be rashness for it; let us know,
    Our indiscretion sometime serves us well

    When our deep plots do pall; and that should learn us
    There's a divinity that shapes our e
nds,
    Rough-hew them how we will-
  Hor. That is most certain.
  Ham. Up from my cabin,
    M
y sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
    Grop'd I to find out them; had my desire,
    Finger'
d their packet, and in fine withdrew
    To mine own room again; making so bold
    (My fears forg
etting manners) to unseal
    Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio
    (O royal knavery!
), an exact command,
    Larded with many several sorts of reasons,
    Importing Denmark's health
, and England's too,
    With, hoo! such bugs and goblins in my life-
    That, on the supervise, 
no leisure bated,
    No, not to stay the finding of the axe,
    My head should be struck off.
 
 Hor. Is't possible?
  Ham. Here's the commission; read it at more leisure.
    But wilt thou bear
 me how I did proceed?
  Hor. I beseech you.
  Ham. Being thus benetted round with villanies,
   
 Or I could make a prologue to my brains,
    They had begun the play. I sat me down;
    Devis'd 
a new commission; wrote it fair.
    I once did hold it, as our statists do,
    A baseness to wri
te fair, and labour'd much
    How to forget that learning; but, sir, now
    It did me yeoman's s
ervice. Wilt thou know
    Th' effect of what I wrote?
  Hor. Ay, good my lord.
  Ham. An earnest
 conjuration from the King,
    As England was his faithful tributary,
    As love between them li
ke the palm might flourish,
    As peace should still her wheaten garland wear
    And stand a com
ma 'tween their amities,
    And many such-like as's of great charge,
    That, on the view and kn
owing of these contents,
    Without debatement further, more or less,
    He should the bearers p
ut to sudden death,
    Not shriving time allow'd.
  Hor. How was this seal'd?
  Ham. Why, even i
n that was heaven ordinant.
    I had my father's signet in my purse,
    Which was the model of t
hat Danish seal;
    Folded the writ up in the form of th' other,
    Subscrib'd it, gave't th' im
pression, plac'd it safely,
    The changeling never known. Now, the next day
    Was our sea-figh
t; and what to this was sequent
    Thou know'st already.
  Hor. So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz g
o to't.
  Ham. Why, man, they did make love to this employment!
    They are not near my conscienc
e; their defeat
    Does by their own insinuation grow.
    'Tis dangerous when the baser nature c
omes
    Between the pass and fell incensed points
    Of mighty opposites.
  Hor. Why, what a ki
ng is this!
  Ham. Does it not, thinks't thee, stand me now upon-
    He that hath kill'd my king,
 and whor'd my mother;
    Popp'd in between th' election and my hopes;
    Thrown out his angle f
or my proper life,
    And with such coz'nage- is't not perfect conscience
    To quit him with th
is arm? And is't not to be damn'd
    To let this canker of our nature come
    In further evil?

  Hor. It must be shortly known to him from England
    What is the issue of the business there.
 
 Ham. It will be short; the interim is mine,
    And a man's life is no more than to say 'one.'
  
  But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
    That to Laertes I forgot myself,
    For by the image of 
my cause I see
    The portraiture of his. I'll court his favours.
    But sure the bravery of his
 grief did put me
    Into a tow'ring passion.
  Hor. Peace! Who comes here?

                 E
nter young Osric, a courtier.

  Osr. Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
  Ham. I hu
mbly thank you, sir. [Aside to Horatio] Dost know this
    waterfly?
  Hor. [aside to Hamlet] No, 
my good lord.
  Ham. [aside to Horatio] Thy state is the more gracious; for
'tis a
    vice to kn
ow him. He hath much land, and fertile. Let a beast
be
    lord of beasts, and his crib shall stan
d at the king's mess.
'Tis
    a chough; but, as I say, spacious in the possession of dirt.

  O
sr. Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should
impart
    a thing to you from his Maje
sty.
  Ham. I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit. Put
your
    bonnet to his righ
t use. 'Tis for the head.
  Osr. I thank your lordship, it is very hot.
  Ham. No, believe me, 'ti
s very cold; the wind is northerly.
  Osr. It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
  Ham. But yet
 methinks it is very sultry and hot for my
complexion.
  Osr. Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sul
try, as 'twere- I
cannot
    tell how. But, my lord, his Majesty bade me signify to you
that
   
 he has laid a great wager on your head. Sir, this is the
matter-
  Ham. I beseech you remember.

                           [Hamlet moves him to put on his hat.]
  Osr. Nay, good my lord; for mine
 ease, in good faith. Sir, here
is
    newly come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute
gentl
eman,
    full of most excellent differences, of very soft society and
    great showing. Indeed, 
to speak feelingly of him, he is the
card
    or calendar of gentry; for you shall find in him the

continent of
    what part a gentleman would see.
  Ham. Sir, his definement suffers no perditio
n in you; though, I

    know, to divide him inventorially would dozy th' arithmetic
of
    memo
ry, and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail.
    But, in the verity of extolment, I ta
ke him to be a soul of
great
    article, and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as, to
mak
e
    true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror, and who
else
    would trace him, his umb
rage, nothing more.
  Osr. Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
  Ham. The concernancy, si
r? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our
more
    rawer breath?
  Osr. Sir?
  Hor [aside to Hamlet
] Is't not possible to understand in
another
    tongue? You will do't, sir, really.
  Ham. What 
imports the nomination of this gentleman?
  Osr. Of Laertes?
  Hor. [aside] His purse is empty alr
eady. All's golden words are
    spent.
  Ham. Of him, sir.
  Osr. I know you are not ignorant-

  Ham. I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would
not
    much approve me. Well, si
r?
  Osr. You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is-
  Ham. I dare not confess that, lest
 I should compare with him in
    excellence; but to know a man well were to know himself.
  Osr. 
I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on
him
    by them, in his meed he's unfel
lowed.
  Ham. What's his weapon?
  Osr. Rapier and dagger.
  Ham. That's two of his weapons- but 
well.
  Osr. The King, sir, hath wager'd with him six Barbary horses;
    against the which he has
 impon'd, as I take it, six French
    rapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers
,
and
    so. Three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy,
    very responsive to th
e hilts, most delicate carriages, and of
    very liberal conceit.
  Ham. What call you the carria
ges?
  Hor. [aside to Hamlet] I knew you must be edified by the
margent
    ere you had done.
  
Osr. The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
  Ham. The phrase would be more germane to the matter if 
we could
    carry cannon by our sides. I would it might be hangers till
then.
    But on! Six Ba
rbary horses against six French swords, their
    assigns, and three liberal-conceited carriages: t
hat's the
French
    bet against the Danish. Why is this all impon'd, as you call
it?
  Osr. The
 King, sir, hath laid that, in a dozen passes between
    yourself and him, he shall not exceed you
 three hits; he hath
    laid on twelve for nine, and it would come to immediate trial
    if your
 lordship would vouchsafe the answer.
  Ham. How if I answer no?
  Osr. I mean, my lord, the oppos
ition of your person in trial.
  Ham. Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please his
Majesty,

    it is the breathing time of day with me. Let the foils be
    brought, the gentleman willing,
 and the King hold his
purpose,
    I will win for him if I can; if not, I will gain nothing but

my
    shame and the odd hits.
  Osr. Shall I redeliver you e'en so?
  Ham. To this effect, sir, 
after what flourish your nature will.
  Osr. I commend my duty to your lordship.
  Ham. Yours, you
rs. [Exit Osric.] He does well to commend it
    himself; there are no tongues else for's turn.
  
Hor. This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.
  Ham. He did comply with his dug before he
 suck'd it. Thus has
he,
    and many more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age
dotes
   
 on, only got the tune of the time and outward habit of
encounter-
    a kind of yesty collection,
 which carries them through and
    through the most fann'd and winnowed opinions; and do but
blow

    them to their trial-the bubbles are out,

                            Enter a Lord.

  Lor
d. My lord, his Majesty commended him to you by young Osric,
who
    brings back to him, that you 
attend him in the hall. He sends
to
    know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that y
ou
will
    take longer time.
  Ham. I am constant to my purposes; they follow the King's
pleasu
re.
    If his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or whensoever,
provided
    I be so able as now
.
  Lord. The King and Queen and all are coming down.
  Ham. In happy time.
  Lord. The Queen des
ires you to use some gentle entertainment to
    Laertes before you fall to play.
  Ham. She well 
instructs me.
                                                    [Exit Lord.]
  Hor. You will los
e this wager, my lord.
  Ham. I do not think so. Since he went into France I have been
in
    con
tinual practice. I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst
not
    think how ill all's here about 
my heart. But it is no matter.
  Hor. Nay, good my lord -
  Ham. It is but foolery; but it is such
 a kind of gaingiving as
    would perhaps trouble a woman.
  Hor. If your mind dislike anything, 
obey it. I will forestall
their
    repair hither and say you are not fit.
  Ham. Not a whit, we 
defy augury; there's a special providence
in
    the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not to 
come; if it
be
    not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will
come:
    the read
iness is all. Since no man knows aught of what he
leaves,
    what is't to leave betimes? Let be.


    Enter King, Queen, Laertes, Osric, and Lords, with other
              Attendants with foils
 and gauntlets.
               A table and flagons of wine on it.

  King. Come, Hamlet, come, an
d take this hand from me.
                    [The King puts Laertes' hand into Hamlet's.]
  Ham. 
Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong;
    But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.
    Thi
s presence knows,
    And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd
    With sore distraction. 
What I have done
    That might your nature, honour, and exception
    Roughly awake, I here procl
aim was madness.
    Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet.
    If Hamlet from himself be tak
en away,
    And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
    Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet den
ies it.
    Who does it, then? His madness. If't be so,
    Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong
'd;
    His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
    Sir, in this audience,
    Let my disclaiming fro
m a purpos'd evil
    Free me so far in your most generous thoughts
    That I have shot my arrow 
o'er the house
    And hurt my brother.
  Laer. I am satisfied in nature,
    Whose motive in thi
s case should stir me most
    To my revenge. But in my terms of honour
    I stand aloof, and wil
l no reconcilement
    Till by some elder masters of known honour
    I have a voice and precedent
 of peace
    To keep my name ungor'd. But till that time
    I do receive your offer'd love like 
love,
    And will not wrong it.
  Ham. I embrace it freely,
    And will this brother's wager fr
ankly play.
    Give us the foils. Come on.
  Laer. Come, one for me.
  Ham. I'll be your foil, L
aertes. In mine ignorance
    Your skill shall, like a star i' th' darkest night,
    Stick fiery 
off indeed.
  Laer. You mock me, sir.
  Ham. No, by this hand.
  King. Give them the foils, young
 Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
    You know the wager?
  Ham. Very well, my lord.
    Your Grace has laid
 the odds o' th' weaker side.
  King. I do not fear it, I have seen you both;
    But since he is 
better'd, we have therefore odds.
  Laer. This is too heavy; let me see another.
  Ham. This likes
 me well. These foils have all a length?
                                                Prepare to
 play.
  Osr. Ay, my good lord.
  King. Set me the stoups of wine upon that table.
    If Hamlet 
give the first or second hit,
    Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
    Let all the battlem
ents their ordnance fire;
    The King shall drink to Hamlet's better breath,
    And in the cup a
n union shall he throw
    Richer than that which four successive kings
    In Denmark's crown hav
e worn. Give me the cups;
    And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
    The trumpet to the cann
oneer without,
    The cannons to the heavens, the heaven to earth,
    'Now the King drinks to Ha
mlet.' Come, begin.
    And you the judges, bear a wary eye.
  Ham. Come on, sir.
  Laer. Come, m
y lord.                                They play.
  Ham. One.
  Laer. No.
  Ham. Judgment!
  Osr
. A hit, a very palpable hit.
  Laer. Well, again!
  King. Stay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl
 is thine;
    Here's to thy health.
               [Drum; trumpets sound; a piece goes off [withi
n].
    Give him the cup.
  Ham. I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile.
    Come. (They pla
y.) Another hit. What say you?
  Laer. A touch, a touch; I do confess't.
  King. Our son shall win
.
  Queen. He's fat, and scant of breath.
    Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows.
    Th
e Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
  Ham. Good madam!
  King. Gertrude, do not drink.
  Que
en. I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.          Drinks.
  King. [aside] It is the poison'd cup;
 it is too late.
  Ham. I dare not drink yet, madam; by-and-by.
  Queen. Come, let me wipe thy fac
e.
  Laer. My lord, I'll hit him now.
  King. I do not think't.
  Laer. [aside] And yet it is alm
ost against my conscience.
  Ham. Come for the third, Laertes! You but dally.
    Pray you pass wi
th your best violence;
    I am afeard you make a wanton of me.
  Laer. Say you so? Come on.      
                         Play.
  Osr. Nothing neither way.
  Laer. Have at you now!
             
   [Laertes wounds Hamlet; then] in scuffling, they
                    change rapiers, [and Hamlet
 wounds Laertes].
  King. Part them! They are incens'd.
  Ham. Nay come! again!                   
      The Queen falls.

  Osr. Look to the Queen there, ho!
  Hor. They bleed on both sides. How 
is it, my lord?
  Osr. How is't, Laertes?
  Laer. Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric.

    I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.
  Ham. How does the Queen?
  King. She sounds to s
ee them bleed.
  Queen. No, no! the drink, the drink! O my dear Hamlet!
    The drink, the drink! 
I am poison'd.                 [Dies.]
  Ham. O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd.
    Treachery
! Seek it out.
                                                [Laertes falls.]
  Laer. It is here
, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain;
    No medicine in the world can do thee good.
    In thee there
 is not half an hour of life.
    The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
    Unbated and enven
om'd. The foul practice
    Hath turn'd itself on me. Lo, here I lie,
    Never to rise again. Thy
 mother's poison'd.
    I can no more. The King, the King's to blame.
  Ham. The point envenom'd t
oo?
    Then, venom, to thy work.                    Hurts the King.
  All. Treason! treason!
  K
ing. O, yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt.
  Ham. Here, thou incestuous, murd'rous, damned Dane
,
    Drink off this potion! Is thy union here?
    Follow my mother.                             
    King dies.
  Laer. He is justly serv'd.
    It is a poison temper'd by himself.
    Exchange 
forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet.
    Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
    Nor thin
e on me!                                       Dies.
  Ham. Heaven make thee free of it! I follow t
hee.
    I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!
    You that look pale and tremble at this cha
nce,
    That are but mutes or audience to this act,
    Had I but time (as this fell sergeant, De
ath,
    Is strict in his arrest) O, I could tell you-
    But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;
   
 Thou liv'st; report me and my cause aright
    To the unsatisfied.
  Hor. Never believe it.
    
I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.
    Here's yet some liquor left.
  Ham. As th'art a man,

    Give me the cup. Let go! By heaven, I'll ha't.
    O good Horatio, what a wounded name
    (Th
ings standing thus unknown) shall live behind me!
    If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,
   
 Absent thee from felicity awhile,
    And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
    To tel
l my story.         [March afar off, and shot within.]
    What warlike noise is this?
  Osr. Youn
g Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
    To the ambassadors of England gives
    This war
like volley.
  Ham. O, I die, Horatio!
    The potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit.
    I can
not live to hear the news from England,
    But I do prophesy th' election lights
    On Fortinbra
s. He has my dying voice.
    So tell him, with th' occurrents, more and less,
    Which have soli
cited- the rest is silence.             Dies.
  Hor. Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet pr
ince,
    And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
                                           
      [March within.]
    Why does the drum come hither?

    Enter Fortinbras and English Ambass
adors, with Drum,
                  Colours, and Attendants.

  Fort. Where is this sight?
  Hor
. What is it you will see?
    If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
  Fort. This quarry c
ries on havoc. O proud Death,
    What feast is toward in thine eternal cell
    That thou so many
 princes at a shot
    So bloodily hast struck.
  Ambassador. The sight is dismal;
    And our af
fairs from England come too late.
    The ears are senseless that should give us hearing
    To te
ll him his commandment is fulfill'd
    That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.
    Where shou
ld we have our thanks?
  Hor. Not from his mouth,
    Had it th' ability of life to thank you.
  
  He never gave commandment for their death.
    But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
   
 You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
    Are here arriv'd, give order that these bodies

    High on a stage be placed to the view;
    And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
    H
ow these things came about. So shall you hear
    Of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts;
    Of acc
idental judgments, casual slaughters;
    Of deaths put on by cunning and forc'd cause;
    And, i
n this upshot, purposes mistook
    Fall'n on th' inventors' heads. All this can I
    Truly deliv
er.
  Fort. Let us haste to hear it,
    And call the noblest to the audience.
    For me, with s
orrow I embrace my fortune.
    I have some rights of memory in this kingdom
    Which now, to cla
im my vantage doth invite me.
  Hor. Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
    And from his mo
uth whose voice will draw on more.
    But let this same be presently perform'd,
    Even while me
n's minds are wild, lest more mischance
    On plots and errors happen.
  Fort. Let four captains

    Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage;
    For he was likely, had he been put on,
    To ha
ve prov'd most royally; and for his passage
    The soldiers' music and the rites of war
    Speak
 loudly for him.
    Take up the bodies. Such a sight as this
    Becomes the field but here shows
 much amiss.
    Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
            Exeunt marching; after the which a peal o
f ordnance
                                                   are shot off.

ACT I. Scene I.
Elsinore. A platform before the Castle.

Enter 
two Sentinels-[first,] Francisco, [who paces up and down
at his post; then] Bernardo, [who approach
es him].

  Ber. Who's there?
  Fran. Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.
  Ber. Long liv
e the King!
  Fran. Bernardo?
  Ber. He.
  Fran. You come most carefully upon your hour.
  Ber. 
'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.
  Fran. For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitte
r cold,
    And I am sick at heart.
  Ber. Have you had quiet guard?
  Fran. Not a mouse stirring
.
  Ber. Well, good night.
    If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
    The rivals of my watch, 
bid them make haste.

                    Enter Horatio and Marcellus.

  Fran. I think I hear t
hem. Stand, ho! Who is there?
  Hor. Friends to this ground.
  Mar. And liegemen to the Dane.
  F
ran. Give you good night.
  Mar. O, farewell, honest soldier.
    Who hath reliev'd you?
  Fran. 
Bernardo hath my place.
    Give you good night.                                   Exit.
  Mar. Ho
lla, Bernardo!
  Ber. Say-
    What, is Horatio there ?
  Hor. A piece of him.
  Ber. Welcome, H
oratio. Welcome, good Marcellus.
  Mar. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
  Ber. I hav
e seen nothing.
  Mar. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
    And will not let belief take hold of
 him
    Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.
    Therefore I have entreated him along,

    With us to watch the minutes of this night,
    That, if again this apparition come,
    He m
ay approve our eyes and speak to it.
  Hor. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
  Ber. Sit down awhile,

    And let us once again assail your ears,
    That are so fortified against our story,
    Wha
t we two nights have seen.
  Hor. Well, sit we down,
    And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.

  Ber. Last night of all,
    When yond same star that's westward from the pole
    Had made his c
ourse t' illume that part of heaven
    Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
    The bell the
n beating one-

                        Enter Ghost.

  Mar. Peace! break thee off! Look where i
t comes again!
  Ber. In the same figure, like the King that's dead.
  Mar. Thou art a scholar; sp
eak to it, Horatio.
  Ber. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.
  Hor. Most like. It harr
ows me with fear and wonder.
  Ber. It would be spoke to.
  Mar. Question it, Horatio.
  Hor. Wha
t art thou that usurp'st this time of night
    Together with that fair and warlike form
    In wh
ich the majesty of buried Denmark
    Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!
  Mar. I
t is offended.
  Ber. See, it stalks away!
  Hor. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!
      
                                               Exit Ghost.
  Mar. 'Tis gone and will not answer.
 
 Ber. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale.
    Is not this something more than fantasy?
  
  What think you on't?
  Hor. Before my God, I might not this believe
    Without the sensible and
 true avouch
    Of mine own eyes.
  Mar. Is it not like the King?
  Hor. As thou art to thyself.

    Such was the very armour he had on
    When he th' ambitious Norway combated.
    So frown'd
 he once when, in an angry parle,
    He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
    'Tis strange.

  Mar. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
    With martial stalk hath he gone by our wa
tch.
  Hor. In what particular thought to work I know not;
    But, in the gross and scope of my o
pinion,
    This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
  Mar. Good now, sit down, and tell me 
he that knows,
    Why this same strict and most observant watch
    So nightly toils the subject 
of the land,
    And why such daily cast of brazen cannon
    And foreign mart for implements of w
ar;
    Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
    Does not divide the Sunday from the w
eek.
    What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
    Doth make the night joint-labourer with 
the day?
    Who is't that can inform me?
  Hor. That can I.
    At least, the whisper goes so. O
ur last king,
    Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
    Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of 
Norway,
    Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
    Dar'd to the combat; in which our vali
ant Hamlet
    (For so this side of our known world esteem'd him)
    Did slay this Fortinbras; wh
o, by a seal'd compact,
    Well ratified by law and heraldry,
    Did forfeit, with his life, all
 those his lands
    Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror;
    Against the which a moiety co
mpetent
    Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
    To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
    H
ad he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant
    And carriage of the article design'd,
    His 
fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
    Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
    Hath in the
 skirts of Norway, here and there,
    Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
    For food and di
et, to some enterprise
    That hath a stomach in't; which is no other,
    As it doth well appear
 unto our state,
    But to recover of us, by strong hand
    And terms compulsatory, those foresa
id lands
    So by his father lost; and this, I take it,
    Is the main motive of our preparation
s,
    The source of this our watch, and the chief head
    Of this post-haste and romage in the l
and.
  Ber. I think it be no other but e'en so.
    Well may it sort that this portentous figure

    Comes armed through our watch, so like the King
    That was and is the question of these wars.

  Hor. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
    In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
   
 A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
    The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead
   
 Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;
    As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood,

    Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
    Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
    
Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.
    And even the like precurse of fierce events,
    As 
harbingers preceding still the fates
    And prologue to the omen coming on,
    Have heaven and e
arth together demonstrated
    Unto our climature and countrymen.

                      Enter Gh
ost again.

    But soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again!
    I'll cross it, though it blast me
.- Stay illusion!
                                               Spreads his arms.
    If thou has
t any sound, or use of voice,
    Speak to me.
    If there be any good thing to be done,
    Tha
t may to thee do ease, and, race to me,
    Speak to me.
    If thou art privy to thy country's fa
te,
    Which happily foreknowing may avoid,
    O, speak!
    Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy l
ife
    Extorted treasure in the womb of earth
    (For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in d
eath),
                                                 The cock crows.
    Speak of it! Stay, and
 speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!
  Mar. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
  Hor. Do, if it will n
ot stand.
  Ber. 'Tis here!
  Hor. 'Tis here!
  Mar. 'Tis gone!
                                
                     Exit Ghost.
    We do it wrong, being so majestical,
    To offer it the show
 of violence;
    For it is as the air, invulnerable,
    And our vain blows malicious mockery.
 
 Ber. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
  Hor. And then it started, like a guilty thing
 
   Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
    The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
    Doth wi
th his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
    Awake the god of day; and at his warning,
    Whether 
in sea or fire, in earth or air,
    Th' extravagant and erring spirit hies
    To his confine; an
d of the truth herein
    This present object made probation.
  Mar. It faded on the crowing of th
e cock.
    Some say that ever, 'gainst that season comes
    Wherein our Saviour's birth is celeb
rated,
    The bird of dawning singeth all night long;
    And then, they say, no spirit dare stir
 abroad,
    The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,
    No fairy takes, nor witch hath 
power to charm,
    So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
  Hor. So have I heard and do in part
 believe it.
    But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
    Walks o'er the dew of yon high eas
tward hill.
    Break we our watch up; and by my advice
    Let us impart what we have seen to-nig
ht
    Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
    This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
    
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
    As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
    L
et's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
    Where we shall find him most conveniently.          
 Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A room of state in the Castle.

Flourish. [Enter Claudius, 
King of Denmark, Gertrude the Queen,
Hamlet,
Polonius, Laertes and his sister Ophelia, [Voltemand,
 Cornelius,]
Lords Attendant.

  King. Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
    The mem
ory be green, and that it us befitted
    To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom
    T
o be contracted in one brow of woe,
    Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
    That we 
with wisest sorrow think on him
    Together with remembrance of ourselves.
    Therefore our some
time sister, now our queen,
    Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,
    Have we, as 'twe
re with a defeated joy,
    With an auspicious, and a dropping eye,
    With mirth in funeral, and
 with dirge in marriage,
    In equal scale weighing delight and dole,
    Taken to wife; nor have
 we herein barr'd
    Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
    With this affair along. For 
all, our thanks.
    Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
    Holding a weak supposal of 
our worth,
    Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
    Our state to be disjoint and out o
f frame,
    Colleagued with this dream of his advantage,
    He hath not fail'd to pester us with
 message
    Importing the surrender of those lands
    Lost by his father, with all bands of law,

    To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
    Now for ourself and for this time of meetin
g.
    Thus much the business is: we have here writ
    To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,
   
 Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears
    Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress
    His fu
rther gait herein, in that the levies,
    The lists, and full proportions are all made
    Out of
 his subject; and we here dispatch
    You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,
    For bearers of
 this greeting to old Norway,
    Giving to you no further personal power
    To business with the
 King, more than the scope
    Of these dilated articles allow.            [Gives a paper.]
    Fa
rewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
  Cor., Volt. In that, and all things, will we show o
ur duty.
  King. We doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell.
                                 Exeunt V
oltemand and Cornelius.
    And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
    You told us of some su
it. What is't, Laertes?
    You cannot speak of reason to the Dane
    And lose your voice. What w
ouldst thou beg, Laertes,
    That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
    The head is not more
 native to the heart,
    The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
    Than is the throne of Denma
rk to thy father.
    What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
  Laer. My dread lord,
    Your leave and 
favour to return to France;
    From whence though willingly I came to Denmark
    To show my duty
 in your coronation,
    Yet now I must confess, that duty done,
    My thoughts and wishes bend a
gain toward France
    And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
  King. Have you your fathe
r's leave? What says Polonius?
  Pol. He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
    By labours
ome petition, and at last
    Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent.
    I do beseech you give hi
m leave to go.
  King. Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,
    And thy best graces spend i
t at thy will!
    But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son-
  Ham. [aside] A little more than kin, a
nd less than kind!
  King. How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
  Ham. Not so, my lord. I 
am too much i' th' sun.
  Queen. Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
    And let thine eye l
ook like a friend on Denmark.
    Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
    Seek for thy noble fath
er in the dust.
    Thou know'st 'tis common. All that lives must die,
    Passing through nature 
to eternity.
  Ham. Ay, madam, it is common.
  Queen. If it be,
    Why seems it so particular wi
th thee?
  Ham. Seems, madam, Nay, it is. I know not 'seems.'
    'Tis not alone my inky cloak, go
od mother,
    Nor customary suits of solemn black,
    Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,
 
   No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
    Nor the dejected havior of the visage,
    Together 
with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
    'That can denote me truly. These indeed seem,
    For 
they are actions that a man might play;
    But I have that within which passeth show-
    These b
ut the trappings and the suits of woe.
  King. 'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,

    To give these mourning duties to your father;
    But you must know, your father lost a father;

    That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
    In filial obligation for some term
  
  To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever
    In obstinate condolement is a course
    Of impious
 stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief;
    It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
    A heart unfor
tified, a mind impatient,
    An understanding simple and unschool'd;
    For what we know must be
, and is as common
    As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
    Why should we in our peevish opp
osition
    Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
    A fault against the dead, a fault t
o nature,
    To reason most absurd, whose common theme
    Is death of fathers, and who still hat
h cried,
    From the first corse till he that died to-day,
    'This must be so.' We pray you thr
ow to earth
    This unprevailing woe, and think of us
    As of a father; for let the world take 
note
    You are the most immediate to our throne,
    And with no less nobility of love
    Than
 that which dearest father bears his son
    Do I impart toward you. For your intent
    In going 
back to school in Wittenberg,
    It is most retrograde to our desire;
    And we beseech you, ben
d you to remain
    Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
    Our chiefest courtier, cousin, a
nd our son.
  Queen. Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.
    I pray thee stay with us, go
 not to Wittenberg.
  Ham. I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
  King. Why, 'tis a loving and 
a fair reply.
    Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come.
    This gentle and unforc'd accord of Ha
mlet
    Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,
    No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-d
ay
    But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
    And the King's rouse the heaven shall br
uit again,
    Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.
                                Flourish. Ex
eunt all but Hamlet.
  Ham. O that this too too solid flesh would melt,
    Thaw, and resolve itse
lf into a dew!
    Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
    His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O G
od! God!
    How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
    Seem to me all the uses of this world!

    Fie on't! ah, fie! 'Tis an unweeded garden
    That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nat
ure
    Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
    But two months dead! Nay, not so much,
 not two.
    So excellent a king, that was to this
    Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mothe
r
    That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
    Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and eart
h!
    Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him
    As if increase of appetite had grown
    B
y what it fed on; and yet, within a month-
    Let me not think on't! Frailty, thy name is woman!-

    A little month, or ere those shoes were old
    With which she followed my poor father's body

    Like Niobe, all tears- why she, even she
    (O God! a beast that wants discourse of reason
 
   Would have mourn'd longer) married with my uncle;
    My father's brother, but no more like my f
ather
    Than I to Hercules. Within a month,
    Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
    
Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
    She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
    With 
such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
    It is not, nor it cannot come to good.
    But break my h
eart, for I must hold my tongue!

          Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo.

  Hor. Hail
 to your lordship!
  Ham. I am glad to see you well.
    Horatio!- or I do forget myself.
  Hor. 
The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
  Ham. Sir, my good friend- I'll change that name wi
th you.
    And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?
    Marcellus?
  Mar. My good lord!
  Ha
m. I am very glad to see you.- [To Bernardo] Good even, sir.-

    But what, in faith, make you fr
om Wittenberg?
  Hor. A truant disposition, good my lord.
  Ham. I would not hear your enemy say s
o,
    Nor shall you do my ear that violence
    To make it truster of your own report
    Agains
t yourself. I know you are no truant.
    But what is your affair in Elsinore?
    We'll teach you
 to drink deep ere you depart.
  Hor. My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
  Ham. I prith
ee do not mock me, fellow student.
    I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
  Hor. Indeed, m
y lord, it followed hard upon.
  Ham. Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats
    Did col
dly furnish forth the marriage tables.
    Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
    Or ever I 
had seen that day, Horatio!
    My father- methinks I see my father.
  Hor. O, where, my lord?
  
Ham. In my mind's eye, Horatio.
  Hor. I saw him once. He was a goodly king.
  Ham. He was a man, 
take him for all in all.
    I shall not look upon his like again.
  Hor. My lord, I think I saw h
im yesternight.
  Ham. Saw? who?
  Hor. My lord, the King your father.
  Ham. The King my father?

  Hor. Season your admiration for a while
    With an attent ear, till I may deliver
    Upon th
e witness of these gentlemen,
    This marvel to you.
  Ham. For God's love let me hear!
  Hor. T
wo nights together had these gentlemen
    (Marcellus and Bernardo) on their watch
    In the dead
 vast and middle of the night
    Been thus encount'red. A figure like your father,
    Armed at p
oint exactly, cap-a-pe,
    Appears before them and with solemn march
    Goes slow and stately by
 them. Thrice he walk'd
    By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
    Within his truncheon's
 length; whilst they distill'd
    Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
    Stand dumb and speak 
not to him. This to me
    In dreadful secrecy impart they did,
    And I with them the third nigh
t kept the watch;
    Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
    Form of the thing, each word
 made true and good,
    The apparition comes. I knew your father.
    These hands are not more li
ke.
  Ham. But where was this?
  Mar. My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
  Ham. Did you
 not speak to it?
  Hor. My lord, I did;
    But answer made it none. Yet once methought
    It l
ifted up it head and did address
    Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
    But even then t
he morning cock crew loud,
    And at the sound it shrunk in haste away
    And vanish'd from our 
sight.
  Ham. 'Tis very strange.
  Hor. As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
    And we did
 think it writ down in our duty
    To let you know of it.
  Ham. Indeed, indeed, sirs. But this t
roubles me.
    Hold you the watch to-night?
  Both [Mar. and Ber.] We do, my lord.
  Ham. Arm'd,
 say you?
  Both. Arm'd, my lord.
  Ham. From top to toe?
  Both. My lord, from head to foot.
  
Ham. Then saw you not his face?
  Hor. O, yes, my lord! He wore his beaver up.
  Ham. What, look'd
 he frowningly.
  Hor. A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
  Ham. Pale or red?
  Hor. Nay
, very pale.
  Ham. And fix'd his eyes upon you?
  Hor. Most constantly.
  Ham. I would I had bee
n there.
  Hor. It would have much amaz'd you.
  Ham. Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
  Hor
. While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
  Both. Longer, longer.
  Hor. Not when I sa
w't.
  Ham. His beard was grizzled- no?
  Hor. It was, as I have seen it in his life,
    A sable
 silver'd.
  Ham. I will watch to-night.
    Perchance 'twill walk again.
  Hor. I warr'nt it wil
l.
  Ham. If it assume my noble father's person,
    I'll speak to it, though hell itself should g
ape
    And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
    If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,

    Let it be tenable in your silence still;
    And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
    Give 
it an understanding but no tongue.
    I will requite your loves. So, fare you well.
    Upon the 
platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
    I'll visit you.
  All. Our duty to your honour.
  Ham. Yo
ur loves, as mine to you. Farewell.
                                        Exeunt [all but Hamlet]
.
    My father's spirit- in arms? All is not well.
    I doubt some foul play. Would the night we
re come!
    Till then sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,
    Though all the earth o'erwhel
m them, to men's eyes.
Exit.




Scene III.
Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius.

Ent
er Laertes and Ophelia.

  Laer. My necessaries are embark'd. Farewell.
    And, sister, as the w
inds give benefit
    And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
    But let me hear from you.
  Oph.
 Do you doubt that?
  Laer. For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,
    Hold it a fashion, and
 a toy in blood;
    A violet in the youth of primy nature,
    Forward, not permanent- sweet, not
 lasting;
    The perfume and suppliance of a minute;
    No more.
  Oph. No more but so?
  Laer
. Think it no more.
    For nature crescent does not grow alone
    In thews and bulk; but as this
 temple waxes,
    The inward service of the mind and soul
    Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves
 you now,
    And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
    The virtue of his will; but you must fe
ar,
    His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
    For he himself is subject to his birth
.
    He may not, as unvalued persons do,
    Carve for himself, for on his choice depends
    Th
e safety and health of this whole state,
    And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd
    Un
to the voice and yielding of that body
    Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
 
   It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
    As he in his particular act and place
    May give
 his saying deed; which is no further
    Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
    Then wei
gh what loss your honour may sustain
    If with too credent ear you list his songs,
    Or lose y
our heart, or your chaste treasure open
    To his unmast'red importunity.
    Fear it, Ophelia, f
ear it, my dear sister,
    And keep you in the rear of your affection,
    Out of the shot and da
nger of desire.
    The chariest maid is prodigal enough
    If she unmask her beauty to the moon.

    Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes.
    The canker galls the infants of the spring

    Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd,
    And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
    Con
tagious blastments are most imminent.
    Be wary then; best safety lies in fear.
    Youth to its
elf rebels, though none else near.
  Oph. I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep
    As watch
man to my heart. But, good my brother,
    Do not as some ungracious pastors do,
    Show me the s
teep and thorny way to heaven,
    Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
    Himself the p
rimrose path of dalliance treads
    And recks not his own rede.
  Laer. O, fear me not!

      
                 Enter Polonius.

    I stay too long. But here my father comes.
    A double ble
ssing is a double grace;
    Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
  Pol. Yet here, Laertes? Aboard
, aboard, for shame!
    The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
    And you are stay'd for. T
here- my blessing with thee!
    And these few precepts in thy memory
    Look thou character. Giv
e thy thoughts no tongue,
    Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.
    Be thou familiar, but by
 no means vulgar:
    Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
    Grapple them unto thy
 soul with hoops of steel;
    But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
    Of each new-hatch'd
, unfledg'd comrade. Beware
    Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,
    Bear't that th' oppose
d may beware of thee.
    Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice;
    Take each man's censure
, but reserve thy judgment.
    Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
    But not express'd in fa
ncy; rich, not gaudy;
    For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
    And they in France of the bes
t rank and station
    Are most select and generous, chief in that.
    Neither a borrower nor a l
ender be;
    For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
    And borrowing dulls the edge of husba
ndry.
    This above all- to thine own self be true,
    And it must follow, as the night the day,

    Thou canst not then be false to any man.
    Farewell. My blessing season this in thee!
  La
er. Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
  Pol. The time invites you. Go, your servants tend.

  Laer. Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well
    What I have said to you.
  Oph. 'Tis in my memory
 lock'd,
    And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
  Laer. Farewell.                         
                 Exit.
  Pol. What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?
  Oph. So please you, somet
hing touching the Lord Hamlet.
  Pol. Marry, well bethought!
    'Tis told me he hath very oft of 
late
    Given private time to you, and you yourself
    Have of your audience been most free and 
bounteous.
    If it be so- as so 'tis put on me,
    And that in way of caution- I must tell you

    You do not understand yourself so clearly
    As it behooves my daughter and your honour.
   
 What is between you? Give me up the truth.
  Oph. He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
   
 Of his affection to me.
  Pol. Affection? Pooh! You speak like a green girl,
    Unsifted in such
 perilous circumstance.
    Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
  Oph. I do not know, my
 lord, what I should think,
  Pol. Marry, I will teach you! Think yourself a baby
    That you hav
e ta'en these tenders for true pay,
    Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,
    O
r (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
    Running it thus) you'll tender me a fool.
  Oph. 
My lord, he hath importun'd me with love
    In honourable fashion.
  Pol. Ay, fashion you may cal
l it. Go to, go to!
  Oph. And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
    With almost all 
the holy vows of heaven.
  Pol. Ay, springes to catch woodcocks! I do know,
    When the blood bur
ns, how prodigal the soul
    Lends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter,
    Giving more light
 than heat, extinct in both
    Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
    You must not take fo
r fire. From this time
    Be something scanter of your maiden presence.
    Set your entreatments
 at a higher rate
    Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
    Believe so much in him, that 
he is young,
    And with a larger tether may he walk
    Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia,

    Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
    Not of that dye which their investments sho
w,
    But mere implorators of unholy suits,
    Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
    T
he better to beguile. This is for all:
    I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth
    H
ave you so slander any moment leisure
    As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
    Look 
to't, I charge you. Come your ways.
  Oph. I shall obey, my lord.
                                
                         Exeunt.




Scene IV.
Elsinore. The platform before the Castle.

En
ter Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus.

  Ham. The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
  Hor. It is
 a nipping and an eager air.
  Ham. What hour now?
  Hor. I think it lacks of twelve.
  Mar. No, 
it is struck.
  Hor. Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws near the season
    Wherein the spirit 
held his wont to walk.
                   A flourish of trumpets, and two pieces go off.
    What 
does this mean, my lord?
  Ham. The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
    Keeps wassail
, and the swagg'ring upspring reels,
    And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
    The k
ettledrum and trumpet thus bray out
    The triumph of his pledge.
  Hor. Is it a custom?
  Ham. 
Ay, marry, is't;
    But to my mind, though I am native here
    And to the manner born, it is a c
ustom
    More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
    This heavy-headed revel east and we
st
    Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations;
    They clip us drunkards and with swinish p
hrase
    Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
    From our achievements, though perform'd at he
ight,
    The pith and marrow of our attribute.
    So oft it chances in particular men
    That,
 for some vicious mole of nature in them,
    As in their birth,- wherein they are not guilty,
   
 Since nature cannot choose his origin,-
    By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
    Oft breakin
g down the pales and forts of reason,
    Or by some habit that too much o'erleavens
    The form 
of plausive manners, that these men
    Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
    Being nature
's livery, or fortune's star,
    Their virtues else- be they as pure as grace,
    As infinite as
 man may undergo-
    Shall in the general censure take corruption
    From that particular fault.
 The dram of e'il
    Doth all the noble substance often dout To his own scandal.

              
           Enter Ghost.

  Hor. Look, my lord, it comes!
  Ham. Angels and ministers of grace def
end us!
    Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
    Bring with thee airs from heaven or b
lasts from hell,
    Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
    Thou com'st in such a questionable s
hape
    That I will speak to thee. I'll call thee Hamlet,
    King, father, royal Dane. O, answer
 me?
    Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell
    Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,
 
   Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre
    Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
    Hath
 op'd his ponderous and marble jaws
    To cast thee up again. What may this mean
    That thou, d
ead corse, again in complete steel,
    Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
    Making night h
ideous, and we fools of nature
    So horridly to shake our disposition
    With thoughts beyond t
he reaches of our souls?
    Say, why is this? wherefore? What should we do?
                     
                      Ghost beckons Hamlet.
  Hor. It beckons you to go away with it,
    As if it
 some impartment did desire
    To you alone.
  Mar. Look with what courteous action
    It waves
 you to a more removed ground.
    But do not go with it!
  Hor. No, by no means!
  Ham. It will 
not speak. Then will I follow it.
  Hor. Do not, my lord!
  Ham. Why, what should be the fear?
  
  I do not set my life at a pin's fee;
    And for my soul, what can it do to that,
    Being a th
ing immortal as itself?
    It waves me forth again. I'll follow it.
  Hor. What if it tempt you t
oward the flood, my lord,
    Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
    That beetles o'er his bas
e into the sea,
    And there assume some other, horrible form
    Which might deprive your sovere
ignty of reason
    And draw you into madness? Think of it.
    The very place puts toys of desper
ation,
    Without more motive, into every brain
    That looks so many fadoms to the sea
    And
 hears it roar beneath.
  Ham. It waves me still.
    Go on. I'll follow thee.
  Mar. You shall n
ot go, my lord.
  Ham. Hold off your hands!
  Hor. Be rul'd. You shall not go.
  Ham. My fate cri
es out
    And makes each petty artire in this body
    As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
    
                                            [Ghost beckons.]

    Still am I call'd. Unhand me, ge
ntlemen.
    By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!-
    I say, away!- Go on. I'll foll
ow thee.
                                        Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet.
  Hor. He waxes desperat
e with imagination.
  Mar. Let's follow. 'Tis not fit thus to obey him.
  Hor. Have after. To what
 issue will this come?
  Mar. Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
  Hor. Heaven will dire
ct it.
  Mar. Nay, let's follow him.
                                                         Exeu
nt.




Scene V.
Elsinore. The Castle. Another part of the fortifications.

Enter Ghost and 
Hamlet.

  Ham. Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak! I'll go no further.
  Ghost. Mark me.
  Ham. I
 will.
  Ghost. My hour is almost come,
    When I to sulph'rous and tormenting flames
    Must r
ender up myself.
  Ham. Alas, poor ghost!
  Ghost. Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
    
To what I shall unfold.
  Ham. Speak. I am bound to hear.
  Ghost. So art thou to revenge, when th
ou shalt hear.
  Ham. What?
  Ghost. I am thy father's spirit,
    Doom'd for a certain term to w
alk the night,
    And for the day confin'd to fast in fires,
    Till the foul crimes done in my 
days of nature
    Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid
    To tell the secrets of my p
rison house,
    I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
    Would harrow up thy soul, freeze th
y young blood,
    Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
    Thy knotted and co
mbined locks to part,
    And each particular hair to stand on end
    Like quills upon the fretfu
l porcupine.
    But this eternal blazon must not be
    To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O
, list!
    If thou didst ever thy dear father love-
  Ham. O God!
  Ghost. Revenge his foul and 
most unnatural murther.
  Ham. Murther?
  Ghost. Murther most foul, as in the best it is;
    But
 this most foul, strange, and unnatural.
  Ham. Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
  
  As meditation or the thoughts of love,
    May sweep to my revenge.
  Ghost. I find thee apt;
 
   And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
    That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
    
Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.
    'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,

    A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark
    Is by a forged process of my death
    Ra
nkly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth,
    The serpent that did sting thy father's life
    Now 
wears his crown.
  Ham. O my prophetic soul!
    My uncle?
  Ghost. Ay, that incestuous, that adu
lterate beast,
    With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts-
    O wicked wit and gifts, 
that have the power
    So to seduce!- won to his shameful lust
    The will of my most seeming-vi
rtuous queen.
    O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there,
    From me, whose love was of that dign
ity
    That it went hand in hand even with the vow
    I made to her in marriage, and to decline

    Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
    To those of mine!
    But virtue, as it never
 will be mov'd,
    Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
    So lust, though to a radian
t angel link'd,
    Will sate itself in a celestial bed
    And prey on garbage.
    But soft! me
thinks I scent the morning air.
    Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
    My custom alw
ays of the afternoon,
    Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
    With juice of cursed hebona in 
a vial,
    And in the porches of my ears did pour
    The leperous distilment; whose effect
    
Holds such an enmity with blood of man
    That swift as quicksilver it courses through
    The na
tural gates and alleys of the body,
    And with a sudden vigour it doth posset
    And curd, like
 eager droppings into milk,
    The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine;
    And a most insta
nt tetter bark'd about,
    Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust
    All my smooth body.

    Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
    Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd
;
    Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
    Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd,
    No reck
oning made, but sent to my account
    With all my imperfections on my head.
  Ham. O, horrible! O
, horrible! most horrible!
  Ghost. If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.
    Let not the roya
l bed of Denmark be
    A couch for luxury and damned incest.
    But, howsoever thou pursuest thi
s act,
    Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
    Against thy mother aught. Leave her t
o heaven,
    And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge
    To prick and sting her. Fare thee we
ll at once.
    The glowworm shows the matin to be near
    And gins to pale his uneffectual fire.

    Adieu, adieu, adieu! Remember me.                      Exit.

  Ham. O all you host of heave
n! O earth! What else?
    And shall I couple hell? Hold, hold, my heart!
    And you, my sinews, 
grow not instant old,
    But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?
    Ay, thou poor ghost, while me
mory holds a seat
    In this distracted globe. Remember thee?
    Yea, from the table of my memor
y
    I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
    All saws of books, all forms, all pressures pas
t
    That youth and observation copied there,
    And thy commandment all alone shall live
    W
ithin the book and volume of my brain,
    Unmix'd with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!
    O most p
ernicious woman!
    O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
    My tables! Meet it is I set 
it down
    That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
    At least I am sure it may be so i
n Denmark.        [Writes.]
    So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word:
    It is 'Adieu, adieu!
 Remember me.'
    I have sworn't.
  Hor. (within) My lord, my lord!

                   Enter H
oratio and Marcellus.

  Mar. Lord Hamlet!
  Hor. Heaven secure him!
  Ham. So be it!
  Mar. Il
lo, ho, ho, my lord!
  Ham. Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.
  Mar. How is't, my noble lord?

  Hor. What news, my lord?
  Mar. O, wonderful!
  Hor. Good my lord, tell it.
  Ham. No, you wil
l reveal it.
  Hor. Not I, my lord, by heaven!
  Mar. Nor I, my lord.
  Ham. How say you then? Wo
uld heart of man once think it?
    But you'll be secret?
  Both. Ay, by heaven, my lord.
  Ham. 
There's neer a villain dwelling in all Denmark
    But he's an arrant knave.
  Hor. There needs no
 ghost, my lord, come from the grave
    To tell us this.
  Ham. Why, right! You are in the right!

    And so, without more circumstance at all,
    I hold it fit that we shake hands and part;
  
  You, as your business and desires shall point you,
    For every man hath business and desire,
 
   Such as it is; and for my own poor part,
    Look you, I'll go pray.
  Hor. These are but wild 
and whirling words, my lord.
  Ham. I am sorry they offend you, heartily;
    Yes, faith, heartily
.
  Hor. There's no offence, my lord.
  Ham. Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
    An
d much offence too. Touching this vision here,
    It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.
  
  For your desire to know what is between us,
    O'ermaster't as you may. And now, good friends,

    As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,
    Give me one poor request.
  Hor. What is't, my
 lord? We will.
  Ham. Never make known what you have seen to-night.
  Both. My lord, we will not.

  Ham. Nay, but swear't.
  Hor. In faith,
    My lord, not I.
  Mar. Nor I, my lord- in faith.

  Ham. Upon my sword.
  Mar. We have sworn, my lord, already.
  Ham. Indeed, upon my sword, indee
d.

                 Ghost cries under the stage.

  Ghost. Swear.
  Ham. Aha boy, say'st thou 
so? Art thou there, truepenny?
    Come on! You hear this fellow in the cellarage.
    Consent to 
swear.
  Hor. Propose the oath, my lord.
  Ham. Never to speak of this that you have seen.
    Sw
ear by my sword.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
  Ham. Hic et ubique? Then we'll shift our ground.
   
 Come hither, gentlemen,
    And lay your hands again upon my sword.
    Never to speak of this th
at you have heard:
    Swear by my sword.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear by his sword.
  Ham. Well said
, old mole! Canst work i' th' earth so fast?
    A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends."

  Hor. O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
  Ham. And therefore as a stranger give it w
elcome.
    There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
    Than are dreamt of in your phi
losophy.
    But come!
    Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
    How strange or odd soe'
er I bear myself
    (As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
    To put an antic disposition on
),
    That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
    With arms encumb'red thus, or this head
-shake,
    Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
    As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could,
 an if we would,'
    Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'
    Or such ambig
uous giving out, to note
    That you know aught of me- this is not to do,
    So grace and mercy 
at your most need help you,
    Swear.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
                                
                   [They swear.]
  Ham. Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! So, gentlemen,
    With all 
my love I do commend me to you;
    And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
    May do t' express his 
love and friending to you,
    God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;
    And still y
our fingers on your lips, I pray.
    The time is out of joint. O cursed spite
    That ever I was
 born to set it right!
    Nay, come, let's go together.
                                         
                Exeunt.

Act II. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the house of Polo
nius.

Enter Polonius and Reynaldo.

  Pol. Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
  Re
y. I will, my lord.
  Pol. You shall do marvell's wisely, good Reynaldo,
    Before You visit him,
 to make inquire
    Of his behaviour.
  Rey. My lord, I did intend it.
  Pol. Marry, well said, 
very well said. Look you, sir,
    Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
    And how, and w
ho, what means, and where they keep,
    What company, at what expense; and finding
    By this en
compassment and drift of question
    That they do know my son, come you more nearer
    Than your
 particular demands will touch it.
    Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
    As 
thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
    And in part him.' Do you mark this, Reynaldo?
  Rey.
 Ay, very well, my lord.
  Pol. 'And in part him, but,' you may say, 'not well.
    But if't be he
 I mean, he's very wild
    Addicted so and so'; and there put on him
    What forgeries you pleas
e; marry, none so rank
    As may dishonour him- take heed of that;
    But, sir, such wanton, wil
d, and usual slips
    As are companions noted and most known
    To youth and liberty.
  Rey. As
 gaming, my lord.
  Pol. Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
    Drabbing. You may go
 so far.
  Rey. My lord, that would dishonour him.
  Pol. Faith, no, as you may season it in the c
harge.
    You must not put another scandal on him,
    That he is open to incontinency.
    That
's not my meaning. But breathe his faults so quaintly
    That they may seem the taints of liberty,

    The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
    A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
    Of genera
l assault.
  Rey. But, my good lord-
  Pol. Wherefore should you do this?
  Rey. Ay, my lord,
  
  I would know that.
  Pol. Marry, sir, here's my drift,
    And I believe it is a fetch of warran
t.
    You laying these slight sullies on my son
    As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' th' work
ing,
    Mark you,
    Your party in converse, him you would sound,
    Having ever seen in the p
renominate crimes
    The youth you breathe of guilty, be assur'd
    He closes with you in this c
onsequence:
    'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman'-
    According to the phrase or the
 addition
    Of man and country-
  Rey. Very good, my lord.
  Pol. And then, sir, does 'a this- 
'a does- What was I about to
say?
    By the mass, I was about to say something! Where did I leave
?
  Rey. At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,' and
    gentleman.'
  Pol. At 'closes
 in the consequence'- Ay, marry!
    He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman.
    I saw him yesterda
y, or t'other day,
    Or then, or then, with such or such; and, as you say,
    There was 'a gami
ng; there o'ertook in's rouse;
    There falling out at tennis'; or perchance,
    'I saw him ente
r such a house of sale,'
    Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
    See you now-
    Your bait of
 falsehood takes this carp of truth;
    And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
    With windlasse
s and with assays of bias,
    By indirections find directions out.
    So, by my former lecture a
nd advice,
    Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?
  Rey. My lord, I have.
  Pol. God b'
 wi' ye, fare ye well!
  Rey. Good my lord!                                    [Going.]
  Pol. Obs
erve his inclination in yourself.
  Rey. I shall, my lord.
  Pol. And let him ply his music.
  Re
y. Well, my lord.
  Pol. Farewell!
                                                  Exit Reynaldo
.

                       Enter Ophelia.

    How now, Ophelia? What's the matter?
  Oph. O my 
lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
  Pol. With what, i' th' name of God?
  Oph. My lord, as
 I was sewing in my closet,
    Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac'd,
    No hat upon his he
ad, his stockings foul'd,
    Ungart'red, and down-gyved to his ankle;
    Pale as his shirt, his 
knees knocking each other,
    And with a look so piteous in purport
    As if he had been loosed 
out of hell
    To speak of horrors- he comes before me.
  Pol. Mad for thy love?
  Oph. My lord,
 I do not know,
    But truly I do fear it.
  Pol. What said he?
  Oph. He took me by the wrist a
nd held me hard;
    Then goes he to the length of all his arm,
    And, with his other hand thus 
o'er his brow,
    He falls to such perusal of my face
    As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so.

    At last, a little shaking of mine arm,
    And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
    
He rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound
    As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
    And end hi
s being. That done, he lets me go,
    And with his head over his shoulder turn'd
    He seem'd to
 find his way without his eyes,
    For out o' doors he went without their help
    And to the las
t bended their light on me.
  Pol. Come, go with me. I will go seek the King.
    This is the very
 ecstasy of love,
    Whose violent property fordoes itself
    And leads the will to desperate un
dertakings
    As oft as any passion under heaven
    That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.

    What, have you given him any hard words of late?
  Oph. No, my good lord; but, as you did comma
nd,
    I did repel his letters and denied
    His access to me.
  Pol. That hath made him mad.

    I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
    I had not quoted him. I fear'd he did but tri
fle
    And meant to wrack thee; but beshrew my jealousy!
    By heaven, it is as proper to our ag
e
    To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
    As it is common for the younger sort
    To la
ck discretion. Come, go we to the King.
    This must be known; which, being kept close, might move

    More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
    Come.
                                      
                   Exeunt.

Scene II.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Flourish. [Enter King an
d Queen, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern,
cum aliis.

  King. Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildens
tern.
    Moreover that we much did long to see you,
    The need we have to use you did provoke

    Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
    Of Hamlet's transformation. So I call it,
    
Sith nor th' exterior nor the inward man
    Resembles that it was. What it should be,
    More th
an his father's death, that thus hath put him
    So much from th' understanding of himself,
    I
 cannot dream of. I entreat you both
    That, being of so young days brought up with him,
    And
 since so neighbour'd to his youth and haviour,
    That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court

    Some little time; so by your companies
    To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather
    So 
much as from occasion you may glean,
    Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus
    That, o
pen'd, lies within our remedy.
  Queen. Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,
    And sure I
 am two men there are not living
    To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
    To show us
 so much gentry and good will
    As to expend your time with us awhile
    For the supply and pro
fit of our hope,
    Your visitation shall receive such thanks
    As fits a king's remembrance.

  Ros. Both your Majesties
    Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
    Put your dread pl
easures more into command
    Than to entreaty.
  Guil. But we both obey,
    And here give up ou
rselves, in the full bent,
    To lay our service freely at your feet,
    To be commanded.
  Kin
g. Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
  Queen. Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrant
z.
    And I beseech you instantly to visit
    My too much changed son.- Go, some of you,
    An
d bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
  Guil. Heavens make our presence and our practices
    P
leasant and helpful to him!
  Queen. Ay, amen!
                 Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenster
n, [with some
                                                    Attendants].

                 
        Enter Polonius.

  Pol. Th' ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
    Are joyfully retur
n'd.
  King. Thou still hast been the father of good news.
  Pol. Have I, my lord? Assure you, my 
good liege,
    I hold my duty as I hold my soul,
    Both to my God and to my gracious king;
   
 And I do think- or else this brain of mine
    Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
    As it ha
th us'd to do- that I have found
    The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
  King. O, speak of that! 
That do I long to hear.
  Pol. Give first admittance to th' ambassadors.
    My news shall be the 
fruit to that great feast.
  King. Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
                  
                              [Exit Polonius.]
    He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found
  
  The head and source of all your son's distemper.
  Queen. I doubt it is no other but the main,
 
   His father's death and our o'erhasty marriage.
  King. Well, we shall sift him.

             
 Enter Polonius, Voltemand, and Cornelius.

    Welcome, my good friends.
    Say, Voltemand, wha
t from our brother Norway?
  Volt. Most fair return of greetings and desires.
    Upon our first, 
he sent out to suppress
    His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
    To be a preparation 'ga
inst the Polack,
    But better look'd into, he truly found
    It was against your Highness; wher
eat griev'd,
    That so his sickness, age, and impotence
    Was falsely borne in hand, sends out
 arrests
    On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys,
    Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fi
ne,
    Makes vow before his uncle never more
    To give th' assay of arms against your Majesty.

    Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
    Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee
    
And his commission to employ those soldiers,
    So levied as before, against the Polack;
    With
 an entreaty, herein further shown,
                                                [Gives a paper.
]
    That it might please you to give quiet pass
    Through your dominions for this enterprise,

    On such regards of safety and allowance
    As therein are set down.
  King. It likes us well
;
    And at our more consider'd time we'll read,
    Answer, and think upon this business.
    M
eantime we thank you for your well-took labour.
    Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together.

    Most welcome home!                       Exeunt Ambassadors.
  Pol. This business is well end
ed.
    My liege, and madam, to expostulate
    What majesty should be, what duty is,
    Why day
 is day, night is night, and time is time.
    Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time.
   
 Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
    And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,

    I will be brief. Your noble son is mad.
    Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,
    
What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
    But let that go.
  Queen. More matter, with less art
.
  Pol. Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
    That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;

    And pity 'tis 'tis true. A foolish figure!
    But farewell it, for I will use no art.
    Mad
 let us grant him then. And now remains
    That we find out the cause of this effect-
    Or rath
er say, the cause of this defect,
    For this effect defective comes by cause.
    Thus it remain
s, and the remainder thus.
    Perpend.
    I have a daughter (have while she is mine),
    Who i
n her duty and obedience, mark,
    Hath given me this. Now gather, and surmise.
                 
                            [Reads] the letter.
    'To the celestial, and my soul's idol, the most
 beautified
      Ophelia,'-

    That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is a vile
  
    phrase.
    But you shall hear. Thus:
                                                        
[Reads.]
    'In her excellent white bosom, these, &c.'
  Queen. Came this from Hamlet to her?
  
Pol. Good madam, stay awhile. I will be faithful.     [Reads.]


          'Doubt thou the stars 
are fire;
            Doubt that the sun doth move;
          Doubt truth to be a liar;
         
   But never doubt I love.

to
  
  reckon my groans; but that I love thee best, O most best,
believe
    it. Adieu.
      'Thine e
vermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to
him,

HAMLET.'

    This, in obedience, hath
 my daughter shown me;
    And more above, hath his solicitings,
    As they fell out by time, by 
means, and place,
    All given to mine ear.
  King. But how hath she
    Receiv'd his love?
  P
ol. What do you think of me?
  King. As of a man faithful and honourable.
  Pol. I would fain prov
e so. But what might you think,
    When I had seen this hot love on the wing
    (As I perceiv'd 
it, I must tell you that,
    Before my daughter told me), what might you,
    Or my dear Majesty 
your queen here, think,
    If I had play'd the desk or table book,
    Or given my heart a winkin
g, mute and dumb,
    Or look'd upon this love with idle sight?
    What might you think? No, I we
nt round to work
    And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
    'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out o
f thy star.
    This must not be.' And then I prescripts gave her,
    That she should lock hersel
f from his resort,
    Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
    Which done, she took the fruits
 of my advice,
    And he, repulsed, a short tale to make,
    Fell into a sadness, then into a fa
st,
    Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
    Thence to a lightness, and, by this declens
ion,
    Into the madness wherein now he raves,
    And all we mourn for.
  King. Do you think 't
is this?
  Queen. it may be, very like.
  Pol. Hath there been such a time- I would fain know that
-
    That I have Positively said ''Tis so,'
    When it prov'd otherwise.?
  King. Not that I kn
ow.
  Pol. [points to his head and shoulder] Take this from this, if
this
      be otherwise.
  
  If circumstances lead me, I will find
    Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
    With
in the centre.
  King. How may we try it further?
  Pol. You know sometimes he walks for hours tog
ether
    Here in the lobby.
  Queen. So he does indeed.
  Pol. At such a time I'll loose my daug
hter to him.
    Be you and I behind an arras then.
    Mark the encounter. If he love her not,
 
   And he not from his reason fall'n thereon
    Let me be no assistant for a state,
    But keep 
a farm and carters.
  King. We will try it.

                 Enter Hamlet, reading on a book.


  Queen. But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
  Pol. Away, I do beseech you, both a
way
    I'll board him presently. O, give me leave.
                       Exeunt King and Queen, 
[with Attendants].
    How does my good Lord Hamlet?
  Ham. Well, God-a-mercy.
  Pol. Do you know
 me, my lord?
  Ham. Excellent well. You are a fishmonger.
  Pol. Not I, my lord.
  Ham. Then I w
ould you were so honest a man.
  Pol. Honest, my lord?
  Ham. Ay, sir. To be honest, as this world
 goes, is to be one
man
    pick'd out of ten thousand.
  Pol. That's very true, my lord.
  Ham.
 For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god
    kissing carrion- Have you a daughter?

  Pol. I have, my lord.
  Ham. Let her not walk i' th' sun. Conception is a blessing, but
not
  
  as your daughter may conceive. Friend, look to't.
  Pol. [aside] How say you by that? Still harpi
ng on my daughter.
Yet
    he knew me not at first. He said I was a fishmonger. He is
far
    go
ne, far gone! And truly in my youth I suff'red much
extremity
    for love- very near this. I'll s
peak to him again.- What do
you
    read, my lord?
  Ham. Words, words, words.
  Pol. What is th
e matter, my lord?
  Ham. Between who?
  Pol. I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
  Ham. S
landers, sir; for the satirical rogue says here that old
men
    have grey beards; that their face
s are wrinkled; their eyes
    purging thick amber and plum-tree gum; and that they have a
    ple
ntiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams. All
which,
    sir, though I most powerfully and
 potently believe, yet I
hold it
    not honesty to have it thus set down; for you yourself, sir,

    should be old as I am if, like a crab, you could go backward.

  Pol. [aside] Though this be 
madness, yet there is a method
in't.-
   Will You walk out of the air, my lord?
  Ham. Into my gr
ave?
  Pol. Indeed, that is out o' th' air. [Aside] How pregnant
sometimes
    his replies are! a
 happiness that often madness hits on,
which
    reason and sanity could not so prosperously be de
livered of.
I
    will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting
between
    him and 
my daughter.- My honourable lord, I will most humbly
take
    my leave of you.
  Ham. You cannot,
 sir, take from me anything that I will more
    willingly part withal- except my life, except my l
ife, except
my
    life,

                    Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Pol. Fare
 you well, my lord.
  Ham. These tedious old fools!
  Pol. You go to seek the Lord Hamlet. There h
e is.
  Ros. [to Polonius] God save you, sir!
                                                Exit
 [Polonius].

  Guil. My honour'd lord!
  Ros. My most dear lord!
  Ham. My excellent good frien
ds! How dost thou, Guildenstern?
Ah,
    Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
  Ros. As the in
different children of the earth.
  Guil. Happy in that we are not over-happy.
    On Fortune's cap
 we are not the very button.
  Ham. Nor the soles of her shoe?
  Ros. Neither, my lord.
  Ham. Th
en you live about her waist, or in the middle of her
    favours?
  Guil. Faith, her privates we.

  Ham. In the secret parts of Fortune? O! most true! she is a
    strumpet. What news ?
  Ros. No
ne, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
  Ham. Then is doomsday near! But your news is not 
true. Let me
    question more in particular. What have you, my good friends,
    deserved at the 
hands of Fortune that she sends you to prison
    hither?
  Guil. Prison, my lord?
  Ham. Denmark
's a prison.
  Ros. Then is the world one.
  Ham. A goodly one; in which there are many confines, 
wards, and
    dungeons, Denmark being one o' th' worst.
  Ros. We think not so, my lord.
  Ham. 
Why, then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either
good
    or bad but thinking makes it so. 
To me it is a prison.
  Ros. Why, then your ambition makes it one. 'Tis too narrow for
your
    m
ind.
  Ham. O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a
    king of infinite space,
 were it not that I have bad dreams.
  Guil. Which dreams indeed are ambition; for the very substan
ce
of
    the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
  Ham. A dream itself is but a shadow.

  Ros. Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality
that
    it is but a shadow's sha
dow.
  Ham. Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and
outstretch'd
    heroes the beggars
' shadows. Shall we to th' court? for, by
my
    fay, I cannot reason.
  Both. We'll wait upon yo
u.
  Ham. No such matter! I will not sort you with the rest of my
    servants; for, to speak to y
ou like an honest man, I am most
    dreadfully attended. But in the beaten way of friendship,
wha
t
    make you at Elsinore?
  Ros. To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
  Ham. Beggar that I
 am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank
you;
    and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear
 a halfpenny.
Were
    you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free
    visitation? C
ome, deal justly with me. Come, come! Nay,
speak.
  Guil. What should we say, my lord?
  Ham. Why
, anything- but to th' purpose. You were sent for; and
    there is a kind of confession in your lo
oks, which your
modesties
    have not craft enough to colour. I know the good King and
Queen
  
  have sent for you.
  Ros. To what end, my lord?
  Ham. That you must teach me. But let me conjur
e you by the
rights
    of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the
    obligation 
of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear
a
    better proposer could charge you withal, b
e even and direct
with
    me, whether you were sent for or no.
  Ros. [aside to Guildenstern] Wh
at say you?
  Ham. [aside] Nay then, I have an eye of you.- If you love me,
hold
    not off.
  
Guil. My lord, we were sent for.
  Ham. I will tell you why. So shall my anticipation prevent your

    discovery, and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no
    feather. I have of late- but wh
erefore I know not- lost all
my
    mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes
s
o
    heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the
earth,
    seems to me a sterile pr
omontory; this most excellent canopy,
the
    air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, thi
s
majestical
    roof fretted with golden fire- why, it appeareth no other
thing
    to me than 
a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What
a
    piece of work is a man! how noble in reas
on! how infinite in
    faculties! in form and moving how express and admirable! in
    action how
 like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the
    beauty of the world, the paragon of animals
! And yet to me
what
    is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me- no, nor
woman
    ne
ither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.
  Ros. My lord, there was no such stuff in my tho
ughts.
  Ham. Why did you laugh then, when I said 'Man delights not me'?
  Ros. To think, my lord,
 if you delight not in man, what lenten
    entertainment the players shall receive from you. We co
ted
them
    on the way, and hither are they coming to offer you service.
  Ham. He that plays th
e king shall be welcome- his Majesty shall
    have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use
 his foil
and
    target; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humorous man
shall
    end his pa
rt in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose
    lungs are tickle o' th' sere; and the lady 
shall say her mind
    freely, or the blank verse shall halt for't. What players are
    they?
  
Ros. Even those you were wont to take such delight in, the
    tragedians of the city.
  Ham. How 
chances it they travel? Their residence, both in
    reputation and profit, was better both ways.

  Ros. I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late
    innovation.
  Ham. Do they hold
 the same estimation they did when I was in
the
    city? Are they so follow'd?
  Ros. No indeed 
are they not.
  Ham. How comes it? Do they grow rusty?
  Ros. Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wo
nted pace; but there
is,
    sir, an eyrie of children, little eyases, that cry out on the
top
 
   of question and are most tyrannically clapp'd for't. These
are now
    the fashion, and so bera
ttle the common stages (so they call
    them) that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goosequills 
and
    dare scarce come thither.
  Ham. What, are they children? Who maintains 'em? How are they

    escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can
    sing? Will they not say afte
rwards, if they should grow
    themselves to common players (as it is most like, if their
means

    are no better), their writers do them wrong to make them
exclaim
    against their own success
ion.
  Ros. Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the
nation
    holds it no sin to
 tarre them to controversy. There was, for
a
    while, no money bid for argument unless the poet 
and the
player
    went to cuffs in the question.
  Ham. Is't possible?
  Guil. O, there has bee
n much throwing about of brains.
  Ham. Do the boys carry it away?
  Ros. Ay, that they do, my lor
d- Hercules and his load too.
  Ham. It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark,
and

    those that would make mows at him while my father lived give
    twenty, forty, fifty, a hundr
ed ducats apiece for his picture
in
    little. 'Sblood, there is something in this more than
nat
ural, if
    philosophy could find it out.

                     Flourish for the Players.

  G
uil. There are the players.
  Ham. Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come!
Th'

    appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me
comply
    with you in this garb, lest
 my extent to the players (which I
    tell you must show fairly outwards) should more appear like

    entertainment than yours. You are welcome. But my
uncle-father
    and aunt-mother are deceiv
'd.
  Guil. In what, my dear lord?
  Ham. I am but mad north-north-west. When the wind is southerl
y
I
    know a hawk from a handsaw.

                            Enter Polonius.

  Pol. Well 
be with you, gentlemen!
  Ham. Hark you, Guildenstern- and you too- at each ear a hearer!
    That
 great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling
    clouts.
  Ros. Happily he's the seco
nd time come to them; for they say an
old
    man is twice a child.
  Ham. I will prophesy he com
es to tell me of the players. Mark
it.-
   You say right, sir; a Monday morning; twas so indeed.

  Pol. My lord, I have news to tell you.
  Ham. My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was 
an
actor in
    Rome-
  Pol. The actors are come hither, my lord.
  Ham. Buzz, buzz!
  Pol. Upo
n my honour-
  Ham. Then came each actor on his ass-
  Pol. The best actors in the world, either f
or tragedy, comedy,
    history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral,
    tragical-his
torical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral;
scene
    individable, or poem unlimited. Seneca ca
nnot be too heavy,
nor
    Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these
are
   
 the only men.
  Ham. O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
  Pol. What treasur
e had he, my lord?
  Ham. Why,

         'One fair daughter, and no more,
           The which h
e loved passing well.'

  Pol. [aside] Still on my daughter.
  Ham. Am I not i' th' right, old Je
phthah?
  Pol. If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I
    love passing well.

  Ham. Nay, that follows not.
  Pol. What follows then, my lord?
  Ham. Why,

           'As by 
lot, God wot,'

 and then, you know,

           'It came to pass, as most like it was.'

    
The first row of the pious chanson will show you more; for
look
    where my abridgment comes.


                     Enter four or five Players.

    You are welcome, masters; welcome, all.- I a
m glad to see
thee
    well.- Welcome, good friends.- O, my old friend? Why, thy
face is
    val
anc'd since I saw thee last. Com'st' thou to' beard me in
    Denmark?- What, my young lady and mis
tress? By'r Lady, your
    ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last by the
    altitu
de of a chopine. Pray God your voice, like a piece of
    uncurrent gold, be not crack'd within the
 ring.- Masters, you
are
    all welcome. We'll e'en to't like French falconers, fly at
    anyth
ing we see. We'll have a speech straight. Come, give us
a
    taste of your quality. Come, a passi
onate speech.
  1. Play. What speech, my good lord?
  Ham. I heard thee speak me a speech once, bu
t it was never
acted;
    or if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember,
pleas'd
    no
t the million, 'twas caviary to the general; but it was (as
I
    receiv'd it, and others, whose j
udgments in such matters
cried in
    the top of mine) an excellent play, well digested in the
sc
enes,
    set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember one said
    there were no sallets 
in the lines to make the matter
savoury,
    nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the aut
hor of
    affectation; but call'd it an honest method, as wholesome as
    sweet, and by very muc
h more handsome than fine. One speech
in't
    I chiefly lov'd. 'Twas AEneas' tale to Dido, and th
ereabout
of it
    especially where he speaks of Priam's slaughter. If it live
in
    your memor
y, begin at this line- let me see, let me see:

         'The rugged Pyrrhus, like th' Hyrcanian b
east-'

    'Tis not so; it begins with Pyrrhus:

         'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable a
rms,
         Black as his purpose, did the night resemble
         When he lay couched in the omi
nous horse,
         Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd
         With heraldry more 
dismal. Head to foot
         Now is be total gules, horridly trick'd
         With blood of fathe
rs, mothers, daughters, sons,
         Bak'd and impasted with the parching streets,
         That
 lend a tyrannous and a damned light
         To their lord's murther. Roasted in wrath and fire,

         And thus o'ersized with coagulate gore,
         With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Py
rrhus
         Old grandsire Priam seeks.'

    So, proceed you.
  Pol. Fore God, my lord, well 
spoken, with good accent and good
     discretion.

  1. Play. 'Anon he finds him,
      Strikin
g too short at Greeks. His antique sword,
      Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
      
Repugnant to command. Unequal match'd,
      Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide;
      
But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
      Th' unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium
,
      Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
      Stoops to his base, and with a hideous c
rash
      Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear. For lo! his sword,
      Which was declining on the milky 
head
      Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' th' air to stick.
      So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus s
tood,
      And, like a neutral to his will and matter,
      Did nothing.
      But, as we often
 see, against some storm,
      A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
      The bold win
ds speechless, and the orb below
      As hush as death- anon the dreadful thunder
      Doth rend
 the region; so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
      Aroused vengeance sets him new awork;
      And never
 did the Cyclops' hammers fall
      On Mars's armour, forg'd for proof eterne,
      With less re
morse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
      Now falls on Priam.
      Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune
! All you gods,
      In general synod take away her power;
      Break all the spokes and fellies
 from her wheel,
      And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
      As low as to the fie
nds!

  Pol. This is too long.
  Ham. It shall to the barber's, with your beard.- Prithee say
on
.
    He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps. Say on;
come to
    Hecuba.

  1. Play.
 'But who, O who, had seen the mobled queen-'

  Ham. 'The mobled queen'?
  Pol. That's good! 'Mo
bled queen' is good.

  1. Play. 'Run barefoot up and down, threat'ning the flames
      With bis
son rheum; a clout upon that head
      Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
      About h
er lank and all o'erteemed loins,
      A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up-
      Who this 
had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd
      'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have pronounc'd.

      But if the gods themselves did see her then,
      When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious spor
t
      In Mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,
      The instant burst of clamour that she
 made
      (Unless things mortal move them not at all)
      Would have made milch the burning ey
es of heaven
      And passion in the gods.'

  Pol. Look, whe'r he has not turn'd his colour, an
d has tears
in's
    eyes. Prithee no more!
  Ham. 'Tis well. I'll have thee speak out the rest o
f this
soon.-
    Good my lord, will you see the players well bestow'd? Do you
    hear? Let them
 be well us'd; for they are the abstract and
brief
    chronicles of the time. After your death yo
u were better have
a
    bad epitaph than their ill report while you live.
  Pol. My lord, I will
 use them according to their desert.
  Ham. God's bodykins, man, much better! Use every man after h
is
    desert, and who should scape whipping? Use them after your
own
    honour and dignity. The
 less they deserve, the more merit is
in
    your bounty. Take them in.
  Pol. Come, sirs.
  Ham
. Follow him, friends. We'll hear a play to-morrow.
                 Exeunt Polonius and Players [e
xcept the First].
    Dost thou hear me, old friend? Can you play 'The Murther of
    Gonzago'?
 
 1. Play. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need, study a
    speec
h of some dozen or sixteen lines which I would set down
and
    insert in't, could you not?
  1. 
Play. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Very well. Follow that lord- and look you mock him not.
                
                            [Exit First Player.]
    My good friends, I'll leave you till night. Yo
u are welcome

    Elsinore.
  Ros. Good my lord!
  Ham. Ay, so, God b' wi' ye!
             
               [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
    Now I am alone.
    O what a rogue and pea
sant slave am I!
    Is it not monstrous that this player here,
    But in a fiction, in a dream o
f passion,
    Could force his soul so to his own conceit
    That, from her working, all his visa
ge wann'd,

    With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!
    For Hecuba!
    What's Hecuba
 to him, or he to Hecuba,
    That he should weep for her? What would he do,
    Had he the motive
 and the cue for passion
    That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
    And cleave the g
eneral ear with horrid speech;
    Make mad the guilty and appal the free,
    Confound the ignora
nt, and amaze indeed
    The very faculties of eyes and ears.
    Yet I,
    A dull and muddy-met
tled rascal, peak
    Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
    And can say nothing! No, not
 for a king,
    Upon whose property and most dear life
    A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a cowar
d?
    Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
    Plucks off my beard and blows it in my fac
e?
    Tweaks me by th' nose? gives me the lie i' th' throat
    As deep as to the lungs? Who does
 me this, ha?
    'Swounds, I should take it! for it cannot be
    But I am pigeon-liver'd and lac
k gall
    To make oppression bitter, or ere this
    I should have fatted all the region kites
 
   With this slave's offal. Bloody bawdy villain!
    Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless
 villain!
    O, vengeance!
    Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
    That I, the son of
 a dear father murther'd,
    Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
    Must (like a whore) u
npack my heart with words
    And fall a-cursing like a very drab,
    A scullion!
    Fie upon't
! foh! About, my brain! Hum, I have heard
    That guilty creatures, sitting at a play,
    Have b
y the very cunning of the scene
    Been struck so to the soul that presently
    They have procla
im'd their malefactions;
    For murther, though it have no tongue, will speak
    With most mirac
ulous organ, I'll have these Players
    Play something like the murther of my father
    Before m
ine uncle. I'll observe his looks;
    I'll tent him to the quick. If he but blench,
    I know my
 course. The spirit that I have seen
    May be a devil; and the devil hath power
    T' assume a 
pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
    Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
    As he is very poten
t with such spirits,
    Abuses me to damn me. I'll have grounds
    More relative than this. The 
play's the thing
    Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King.         Exit.

ACT III. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rose
ncrantz, Guildenstern,
and Lords.

  King. And can you by no drift of circumstance
    Get from 
him why he puts on this confusion,
    Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
    With turbulent
 and dangerous lunacy?
  Ros. He does confess he feels himself distracted,
    But from what cause
 he will by no means speak.
  Guil. Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
    But with a craft
y madness keeps aloof
    When we would bring him on to some confession
    Of his true state.
  
Queen. Did he receive you well?
  Ros. Most like a gentleman.
  Guil. But with much forcing of his
 disposition.
  Ros. Niggard of question, but of our demands
    Most free in his reply.
  Queen.
 Did you assay him
    To any pastime?
  Ros. Madam, it so fell out that certain players
    We o
'erraught on the way. Of these we told him,
    And there did seem in him a kind of joy
    To hea
r of it. They are here about the court,
    And, as I think, they have already order
    This nigh
t to play before him.
  Pol. 'Tis most true;
    And he beseech'd me to entreat your Majesties
  
  To hear and see the matter.
  King. With all my heart, and it doth much content me
    To hear h
im so inclin'd.
    Good gentlemen, give him a further edge
    And drive his purpose on to these 
delights.
  Ros. We shall, my lord.
                            Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenster
n.
  King. Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
    For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
    That
 he, as 'twere by accident, may here
    Affront Ophelia.
    Her father and myself (lawful espial
s)
    Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing unseen,
    We may of their encounter frankly judge

    And gather by him, as he is behav'd,
    If't be th' affliction of his love, or no,
    That t
hus he suffers for.
  Queen. I shall obey you;
    And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
    That
 your good beauties be the happy cause
    Of Hamlet's wildness. So shall I hope your virtues
    
Will bring him to his wonted way again,
    To both your honours.
  Oph. Madam, I wish it may.
  
                                                 [Exit Queen.]
  Pol. Ophelia, walk you here.- Grac
ious, so please you,
    We will bestow ourselves.- [To Ophelia] Read on this book,
    That show 
of such an exercise may colour
    Your loneliness.- We are oft to blame in this,
    'Tis too muc
h prov'd, that with devotion's visage
    And pious action we do sugar o'er
    The Devil himself.

  King. [aside] O, 'tis too true!
    How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
    
The harlot's cheek, beautied with plast'ring art,
    Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it

    Than is my deed to my most painted word.
    O heavy burthen!
  Pol. I hear him coming. Let's 
withdraw, my lord.
                                      Exeunt King and Polonius].

            
               Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. To be, or not to be- that is the question:
    Whether 'tis 
nobler in the mind to suffer
    The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
    Or to take arms a
gainst a sea of troubles,
    And by opposing end them. To die- to sleep-
    No more; and by a sl
eep to say we end
    The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks
    That flesh is heir to. 'T
is a consummation
    Devoutly to be wish'd. To die- to sleep.
    To sleep- perchance to dream: a
y, there's the rub!
    For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
    When we have shuffled 
off this mortal coil,
    Must give us pause. There's the respect
    That makes calamity of so lo
ng life.
    For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
    Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud
 man's contumely,
    The pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay,
    The insolence of office, an
d the spurns
    That patient merit of th' unworthy takes,
    When he himself might his quietus m
ake
    With a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear,
    To grunt and sweat under a weary lif
e,
    But that the dread of something after death-
    The undiscover'd country, from whose bourn

    No traveller returns- puzzles the will,
    And makes us rather bear those ills we have
    
Than fly to others that we know not of?
    Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
    And t
hus the native hue of resolution
    Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
    And enter
prises of great pith and moment
    With this regard their currents turn awry
    And lose the nam
e of action.- Soft you now!
    The fair Ophelia!- Nymph, in thy orisons
    Be all my sins rememb
'red.
  Oph. Good my lord,
    How does your honour for this many a day?
  Ham. I humbly thank yo
u; well, well, well.
  Oph. My lord, I have remembrances of yours
    That I have longed long to r
e-deliver.
    I pray you, now receive them.
  Ham. No, not I!
    I never gave you aught.
  Oph
. My honour'd lord, you know right well you did,
    And with them words of so sweet breath compos'
d
    As made the things more rich. Their perfume lost,
    Take these again; for to the noble min
d
    Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
    There, my lord.
  Ham. Ha, ha! Are you ho
nest?
  Oph. My lord?
  Ham. Are you fair?
  Oph. What means your lordship?
  Ham. That if you b
e honest and fair, your honesty should admit
no
    discourse to your beauty.
  Oph. Could beauty
, my lord, have better commerce than with
honesty?
  Ham. Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will 
sooner transform
    honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty
can
    translat
e beauty into his likeness. This was sometime a
paradox,
    but now the time gives it proof. I di
d love you once.
  Oph. Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
  Ham. You should not have believ
'd me; for virtue cannot so
    inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it. I loved
you
  
  not.
  Oph. I was the more deceived.
  Ham. Get thee to a nunnery! Why wouldst thou be a breeder
 of
    sinners? I am myself indifferent honest, but yet I could
accuse
    me of such things tha
t it were better my mother had not borne
me.
    I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more
 offences at
my
    beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give
    them shape,
 or time to act them in. What should such fellows
as I
    do, crawling between earth and heaven? 
We are arrant knaves
all;
    believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where's your
    fath
er?
  Oph. At home, my lord.
  Ham. Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool
   
 nowhere but in's own house. Farewell.
  Oph. O, help him, you sweet heavens!
  Ham. If thou dost 
marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy
dowry:
    be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, th
ou shalt not
escape
    calumny. Get thee to a nunnery. Go, farewell. Or if thou wilt
    needs m
arry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what
    monsters you make of them. To a nunnery,
 go; and quickly too.
    Farewell.
  Oph. O heavenly powers, restore him!
  Ham. I have heard of
 your paintings too, well enough. God hath
    given you one face, and you make yourselves another.
 You jig,
you
    amble, and you lisp; you nickname God's creatures and make
your
    wantonness
 your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't! it hath
made
    me mad. I say, we will have no more ma
rriages. Those that are
    married already- all but one- shall live; the rest shall keep
as
    
they are. To a nunnery, go.                            Exit.
  Oph. O, what a noble mind is here o'
erthrown!
    The courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword,
    Th' expectancy and ros
e of the fair state,
    The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
    Th' observ'd of all obser
vers- quite, quite down!
    And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
    That suck'd the honey 
of his music vows,
    Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
    Like sweet bells jangled,
 out of tune and harsh;
    That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
    Blasted with ecstas
y. O, woe is me
    T' have seen what I have seen, see what I see!

                   Enter King
 and Polonius.

  King. Love? his affections do not that way tend;
    Nor what he spake, though 
it lack'd form a little,
    Was not like madness. There's something in his soul
    O'er which hi
s melancholy sits on brood;
    And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
    Will be some danger;
 which for to prevent,
    I have in quick determination
    Thus set it down: he shall with speed
 to England
    For the demand of our neglected tribute.
    Haply the seas, and countries differe
nt,
    With variable objects, shall expel
    This something-settled matter in his heart,
    Wh
ereon his brains still beating puts him thus
    From fashion of himself. What think you on't?
  P
ol. It shall do well. But yet do I believe
    The origin and commencement of his grief
    Sprung
 from neglected love.- How now, Ophelia?
    You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said.
    We he
ard it all.- My lord, do as you please;
    But if you hold it fit, after the play
    Let his que
en mother all alone entreat him
    To show his grief. Let her be round with him;
    And I'll be 
plac'd so please you, in the ear
    Of all their conference. If she find him not,
    To England 
send him; or confine him where
    Your wisdom best shall think.
  King. It shall be so.
    Madn
ess in great ones must not unwatch'd go.         Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. hall in the C
astle.

Enter Hamlet and three of the Players.

  Ham. Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronou
nc'd it to you,
    trippingly on the tongue. But if you mouth it, as many of our
    players do, 
I had as live the town crier spoke my lines. Nor
do
    not saw the air too much with your hand, t
hus, but use all
    gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and (as I may say)
    whirlwind of
 your passion, you must acquire and beget a
    temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offen
ds me to
the
    soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion
to
    tatters, t
o very rags, to split the cars of the groundlings,
who
    (for the most part) are capable of noth
ing but inexplicable
dumb
    shows and noise. I would have such a fellow whipp'd for
o'erdoing

    Termagant. It out-herods Herod. Pray you avoid it.
  Player. I warrant your honour.
  Ham. Be 
not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be
your
    tutor. Suit the action to the word, 
the word to the action;
with
    this special observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of
  
  nature: for anything so overdone is from the purpose of
playing,
    whose end, both at the firs
t and now, was and is, to hold, as
    'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show Virtue her own
fea
ture,
    scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time
his
    form and pressure. N
ow this overdone, or come tardy off,
though
    it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the j
udicious
    grieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance
    o'erweigh a whole the
atre of others. O, there be players that
I
    have seen play, and heard others praise, and that h
ighly (not
to
    speak it profanely), that, neither having the accent of
    Christians, nor the
 gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have
so
    strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of 
Nature's
    journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they
imitated
    humanity so abomi
nably.
  Player. I hope we have reform'd that indifferently with us,
sir.
  Ham. O, reform it alt
ogether! And let those that play your
clowns
    speak no more than is set down for them. For ther
e be of them
    that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren
    spectators to l
augh too, though in the mean time some
necessary
    question of the play be then to be considered
. That's
villanous
    and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it.
Go
    make y
ou ready.
                                                 Exeunt Players.

            Enter Pol
onius, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.

    How now, my lord? Will the King hear this piece of work
?
  Pol. And the Queen too, and that presently.
  Ham. Bid the players make haste, [Exit Polonius.
] Will you two
    help to hasten them?
  Both. We will, my lord.                       Exeunt the
y two.
  Ham. What, ho, Horatio!

                      Enter Horatio.

  Hor. Here, sweet lord
, at your service.
  Ham. Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
    As e'er my conversation cop'd w
ithal.
  Hor. O, my dear lord!
  Ham. Nay, do not think I flatter;
    For what advancement may I
 hope from thee,
    That no revenue hast but thy good spirits
    To feed and clothe thee? Why sh
ould the poor be flatter'd?
    No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
    And crook the pre
gnant hinges of the knee
    Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
    Since my dear so
ul was mistress of her choice
    And could of men distinguish, her election
    Hath seal'd thee 
for herself. For thou hast been
    As one, in suff'ring all, that suffers nothing;
    A man that
 Fortune's buffets and rewards
    Hast ta'en with equal thanks; and blest are those
    Whose blo
od and judgment are so well commingled
    That they are not a pipe for Fortune's finger
    To so
und what stop she please. Give me that man
    That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
  
  In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
    As I do thee. Something too much of this I
   
 There is a play to-night before the King.
    One scene of it comes near the circumstance,
    Wh
ich I have told thee, of my father's death.
    I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
    Eve
n with the very comment of thy soul
    Observe my uncle. If his occulted guilt
    Do not itself 
unkennel in one speech,
    It is a damned ghost that we have seen,
    And my imaginations are as
 foul
    As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
    For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,

    And after we will both our judgments join
    In censure of his seeming.
  Hor. Well, my lord.

    If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
    And scape detecting, I will pay the th
eft.

    Sound a flourish. [Enter Trumpets and Kettledrums. Danish
    march. [Enter King, Queen
, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz,
      Guildenstern, and other Lords attendant, with the Guard
  
                     carrying torches.

  Ham. They are coming to the play. I must be idle.
    G
et you a place.
  King. How fares our cousin Hamlet?
  Ham. Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon'
s dish. I eat the
air,
    promise-cramm'd. You cannot feed capons so.
  King. I have nothing wit
h this answer, Hamlet. These words are
not
    mine.
  Ham. No, nor mine now. [To Polonius] My lo
rd, you play'd once
    i' th' university, you say?
  Pol. That did I, my lord, and was accounted 
a good actor.
  Ham. What did you enact?
  Pol. I did enact Julius Caesar; I was kill'd i' th' Cap
itol;
Brutus
    kill'd me.
  Ham. It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf
there. B
e
    the players ready.
  Ros. Ay, my lord. They stay upon your patience.
  Queen. Come hither, 
my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
  Ham. No, good mother. Here's metal more attractive.
  Pol. [to the Ki
ng] O, ho! do you mark that?
  Ham. Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
                               
   [Sits down at Ophelia's feet.]

  Oph. No, my lord.
  Ham. I mean, my head upon your lap?
  O
ph. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Do you think I meant country matters?
  Oph. I think nothing, my lord.
  
Ham. That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
  Oph. What is, my lord?
  Ham. Nothing.
 
 Oph. You are merry, my lord.
  Ham. Who, I?
  Oph. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. O God, your only jig-make
r! What should a man do but be
merry?
    For look you how cheerfully my mother looks, and my fath
er
died
    within 's two hours.
  Oph. Nay 'tis twice two months, my lord.
  Ham. So long? Nay 
then, let the devil wear black, for I'll have
a
    suit of sables. O heavens! die two months ago,
 and not
forgotten
    yet? Then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his
life
    half
 a year. But, by'r Lady, he must build churches then; or
else
    shall he suffer not thinking on,
 with the hobby-horse, whose

    epitaph is 'For O, for O, the hobby-horse is forgot!'

       
        Hautboys play. The dumb show enters.

    Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Quee
n embracing
    him and he her. She kneels, and makes show of protestation
    unto him. He takes 
her up, and declines his head upon her
    neck. He lays him down upon a bank of flowers. She, seei
ng
    him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his
    crown, kisses it, pours p
oison in the sleeper's ears, and
    leaves him. The Queen returns, finds the King dead, and makes

    passionate action. The Poisoner with some three or four
Mutes,
    comes in again, seem to co
ndole with her. The dead body is
    carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with gifts; she
  
  seems harsh and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts
    his love.
                         
                                Exeunt.

  Oph. What means this, my lord?
  Ham. Marry, this is m
iching malhecho; it means mischief.
  Oph. Belike this show imports the argument of the play.

  
                    Enter Prologue.

  Ham. We shall know by this fellow. The players cannot keep

counsel;
    they'll tell all.
  Oph. Will he tell us what this show meant?
  Ham. Ay, or any sh
ow that you'll show him. Be not you asham'd
to
    show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means
.
  Oph. You are naught, you are naught! I'll mark the play.

    Pro. For us, and for our traged
y,
      Here stooping to your clemency,
      We beg your hearing patiently.                     
[Exit.]

  Ham. Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
  Oph. 'Tis brief, my lord.
  Ham. As
 woman's love.

              Enter [two Players as] King and Queen.

    King. Full thirty time

. So many journeys may the sun and moon
      Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
      But
 woe is me! you are so sick of late,
      So far from cheer and from your former state.
      Tha
t I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
      Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must;
      Fo
r women's fear and love holds quantity,
      In neither aught, or in extremity.
      Now what my
 love is, proof hath made you know;
      And as my love is siz'd, my fear is so.
      Where love
 is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
      Where little fears grow great, great love grows ther
e.
    King. Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;
      My operant powers their functi
ons leave to do.
      And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
      Honour'd, belov'd, and
 haply one as kind
      For husband shalt thou-
    Queen. O, confound the rest!
      Such love
 must needs be treason in my breast.
      When second husband let me be accurst!
      None wed t
he second but who killed the first.

  Ham. [aside] Wormwood, wormwood!

    Queen. The instance
s that second marriage move
      Are base respects of thrift, but none of love.
      A second ti
me I kill my husband dead
      When second husband kisses me in bed.
    King. I do believe you t
hink what now you speak;
      But what we do determine oft we break.
      Purpose is but the sla
ve to memory,
      Of violent birth, but poor validity;
      Which now, like fruit unripe, stick
s on the tree,
      But fall unshaken when they mellow be.
      Most necessary 'tis that we forg
et
      To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt.
      What to ourselves in passion we propose
,
      The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
      The violence of either grief or joy
    
  Their own enactures with themselves destroy.
      Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;

      Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
      This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not
 strange
      That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
      For 'tis a question left
 us yet to prove,
      Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
      The great man down,
 you mark his favourite flies,
      The poor advanc'd makes friends of enemies;
      And hithert
o doth love on fortune tend,
      For who not needs shall never lack a friend,
      And who in w
ant a hollow friend doth try,
      Directly seasons him his enemy.
      But, orderly to end wher
e I begun,
      Our wills and fates do so contrary run
      That our devices still are overthrow
n;
      Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own.
      So think thou wilt no second hus
band wed;
      But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
    Queen. Nor earth to me give 
food, nor heaven light,
      Sport and repose lock from me day and night,
      To desperation tu
rn my trust and hope,
      An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope,
      Each opposite that blan
ks the face of joy
      Meet what I would have well, and it destroy,
      Both here and hence pu
rsue me lasting strife,
      If, once a widow, ever I be wife!

  Ham. If she should break it no
w!

    King. 'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile.
      My spirits grow dull, and fai
n I would beguile
      The tedious day with sleep.
    Queen. Sleep rock thy brain,
            
                                        [He] sleeps.
      And never come mischance between us twai
n!
Exit.

  Ham. Madam, how like you this play?
  Queen. The lady doth protest too much, methink
s.
  Ham. O, but she'll keep her word.
  King. Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in
't?
  Ham. No, no! They do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i'
th'
    world.
  King. What d
o you call the play?
  Ham. 'The Mousetrap.' Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the
    image of
 a murther done in Vienna. Gonzago is the duke's
name;
    his wife, Baptista. You shall see anon.
 'Tis a knavish piece
of
    work; but what o' that? Your Majesty, and we that have free
    soul
s, it touches us not. Let the gall'd jade winch; our
withers
    are unwrung.

                 
        Enter Lucianus.

    This is one Lucianus, nephew to the King.
  Oph. You are as good as 
a chorus, my lord.
  Ham. I could interpret between you and your love, if I could
see
    the pup
pets dallying.
  Oph. You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
  Ham. It would cost you a groaning to 
take off my edge.
  Oph. Still better, and worse.
  Ham. So you must take your husbands.- Begin, m
urtherer. Pox,
leave
    thy damnable faces, and begin! Come, the croaking raven doth
    bellow 
for revenge.

    Luc. Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
      Confederate
 season, else no creature seeing;
      Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,
      With
 Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,
      Thy natural magic and dire property
      On 
wholesome life usurp immediately.
                                   Pours the poison in his ears.


  Ham. He poisons him i' th' garden for's estate. His name's
Gonzago.
    The story is extant, 
and written in very choice Italian. You
    shall see anon how the murtherer gets the love of Gonza
go's
wife.
  Oph. The King rises.
  Ham. What, frighted with false fire?
  Queen. How fares my l
ord?
  Pol. Give o'er the play.
  King. Give me some light! Away!
  All. Lights, lights, lights!

                              Exeunt all but Hamlet and Horatio.
  Ham.   Why, let the strucken de
er go weep,
          The hart ungalled play;
         For some must watch, while some must sleep:

          Thus runs the world away.
    Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers- if the res
t of
my
    fortunes turn Turk with me-with two Provincial roses on my
raz'd
    shoes, get me a
 fellowship in a cry of players, sir?
  Hor. Half a share.
  Ham.   A whole one I!
         For t
hou dost know, O Damon dear,
           This realm dismantled was
         Of Jove himself; and no
w reigns here
           A very, very- pajock.
  Hor. You might have rhym'd.
  Ham. O good Horati
o, I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand
    pound! Didst perceive?
  Hor. Very well, my lord.

  Ham. Upon the talk of the poisoning?
  Hor. I did very well note him.
  Ham.   Aha! Come, some
 music! Come, the recorders!
         For if the King like not the comedy,
         Why then, beli
ke he likes it not, perdy.
    Come, some music!

                Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenst
ern.

  Guil. Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.
  Ham. Sir, a whole history.
  Guil. T
he King, sir-
  Ham. Ay, sir, what of him?
  Guil. Is in his retirement, marvellous distemper'd.

  Ham. With drink, sir?
  Guil. No, my lord; rather with choler.
  Ham. Your wisdom should show it
self more richer to signify this
to
    the doctor; for me to put him to his purgation would perha
ps
    plunge him into far more choler.
  Guil. Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame, 
and
start
    not so wildly from my affair.
  Ham. I am tame, sir; pronounce.
  Guil. The Queen,
 your mother, in most great affliction of
spirit
    hath sent me to you.
  Ham. You are welcome.

  Guil. Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right
breed.
    If it shall please you t
o make me a wholesome answer, I will
do
    your mother's commandment; if not, your pardon and my 
return
    shall be the end of my business.
  Ham. Sir, I cannot.
  Guil. What, my lord?
  Ham. 
Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseas'd. But, sir,
such
    answer as I can make, you shall
 command; or rather, as you
say,
    my mother. Therefore no more, but to the matter! My mother,

you
    say-
  Ros. Then thus she says: your behaviour hath struck her into
    amazement and adm
iration.
  Ham. O wonderful son, that can so stonish a mother! But is
there no
    sequel at the 
heels of this mother's admiration? Impart.
  Ros. She desires to speak with you in her closet ere y
ou go to
bed.
  Ham. We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any
    further trade
 with us?
  Ros. My lord, you once did love me.
  Ham. And do still, by these pickers and stealers
!
  Ros. Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? You do
surely
    bar the door upon your 
own liberty, if you deny your griefs
to
    your friend.
  Ham. Sir, I lack advancement.
  Ros. 
How can that be, when you have the voice of the King
himself
    for your succession in Denmark?

  Ham. Ay, sir, but 'while the grass grows'- the proverb is
something
    musty.

              
       Enter the Players with recorders.

    O, the recorders! Let me see one. To withdraw with y
ou- why
do
    you go about to recover the wind of me, as if you would drive
me
    into a toil?

  Guil. O my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too
unmannerly.
  Ham. I do not well under
stand that. Will you play upon this
pipe?
  Guil. My lord, I cannot.
  Ham. I pray you.
  Guil. 
Believe me, I cannot.
  Ham. I do beseech you.
  Guil. I know, no touch of it, my lord.
  Ham. It
 is as easy as lying. Govern these ventages with your
    fingers and thumbs, give it breath with y
our mouth, and it
will
    discourse most eloquent music. Look you, these are the stops.
  Guil. 
But these cannot I command to any utt'rance of harmony. I
    have not the skill.
  Ham. Why, look
 you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me!
You
    would play upon me; you would seem to know 
my stops; you
would
    pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound me from my
    lowest 
note to the top of my compass; and there is much
music,
    excellent voice, in this little organ,
 yet cannot you make it
    speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am easier to be play'd on than
a
    p
ipe? Call me what instrument you will, though you can fret
me,
    you cannot play upon me.

   
                     Enter Polonius.

    God bless you, sir!
  Pol. My lord, the Queen would spe
ak with you, and presently.
  Ham. Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
  Po
l. By th' mass, and 'tis like a camel indeed.
  Ham. Methinks it is like a weasel.
  Pol. It is ba
ck'd like a weasel.
  Ham. Or like a whale.
  Pol. Very like a whale.
  Ham. Then will I come to 
my mother by-and-by.- They fool me to
the
    top of my bent.- I will come by-and-by.
  Pol. I wi
ll say so.                                      Exit.
  Ham. 'By-and-by' is easily said.- Leave me,
 friends.
                                        [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]

    'Tis now the very
 witching time of night,
    When churchyards yawn, and hell itself breathes out
    Contagion to 
this world. Now could I drink hot blood
    And do such bitter business as the day
    Would quake
 to look on. Soft! now to my mother!
    O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever
    The soul o
f Nero enter this firm bosom.
    Let me be cruel, not unnatural;
    I will speak daggers to her,
 but use none.
    My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites-
    How in my words somever she be sh
ent,
    To give them seals never, my soul, consent!             Exit.




Scene III.
A room 
in the Castle.

Enter King, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.

  King. I like him not, nor stands i
t safe with us
    To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;
    I your commission will for
thwith dispatch,
    And he to England shall along with you.
    The terms of our estate may not e
ndure
    Hazard so near us as doth hourly grow
    Out of his lunacies.
  Guil. We will ourselve
s provide.
    Most holy and religious fear it is
    To keep those many many bodies safe
    Tha
t live and feed upon your Majesty.
  Ros. The single and peculiar life is bound
    With all the s
trength and armour of the mind
    To keep itself from noyance; but much more
    That spirit upon
 whose weal depends and rests
    The lives of many. The cesse of majesty
    Dies not alone, but 
like a gulf doth draw
    What's near it with it. It is a massy wheel,
    Fix'd on the summit of 
the highest mount,
    To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
    Are mortis'd and adjoin
'd; which when it falls,
    Each small annexment, petty consequence,
    Attends the boist'rous r
uin. Never alone
    Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.
  King. Arm you, I pray you, to 
this speedy voyage;
    For we will fetters put upon this fear,
    Which now goes too free-footed
.
  Both. We will haste us.
                                               Exeunt Gentlemen.

  
                 Enter Polonius.

  Pol. My lord, he's going to his mother's closet.
    Behind t
he arras I'll convey myself
    To hear the process. I'll warrant she'll tax him home;
    And, as
 you said, and wisely was it said,
    'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,
    Since 
nature makes them partial, should o'erhear
    The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege.
  
  I'll call upon you ere you go to bed
    And tell you what I know.
  King. Thanks, dear my lord.

                                                Exit [Polonius].
    O, my offence is rank, it sm
ells to heaven;
    It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,
    A brother's murther! Pray can I no
t,
    Though inclination be as sharp as will.
    My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent,
  
  And, like a man to double business bound,
    I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
    An
d both neglect. What if this cursed hand
    Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,
    Is
 there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
    To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
   
 But to confront the visage of offence?
    And what's in prayer but this twofold force,
    To be
 forestalled ere we come to fall,
    Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;
    My fault is p
ast. But, O, what form of prayer
    Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murther'?
    That can
not be; since I am still possess'd
    Of those effects for which I did the murther-
    My crown,
 mine own ambition, and my queen.
    May one be pardon'd and retain th' offence?
    In the corru
pted currents of this world
    Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,
    And oft 'tis seen 
the wicked prize itself
    Buys out the law; but 'tis not so above.
    There is no shuffling; th
ere the action lies
    In his true nature, and we ourselves compell'd,
    Even to the teeth and 
forehead of our faults,
    To give in evidence. What then? What rests?
    Try what repentance ca
n. What can it not?
    Yet what can it when one cannot repent?
    O wretched state! O bosom blac
k as death!
    O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
    Art more engag'd! Help, angels! Mak
e assay.
    Bow, stubborn knees; and heart with strings of steel,
    Be soft as sinews of the ne
w-born babe!
    All may be well.                                  He kneels.

                  
       Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
    And now I'll do't. And
 so he goes to heaven,
    And so am I reveng'd. That would be scann'd.
    A villain kills my fat
her; and for that,
    I, his sole son, do this same villain send
    To heaven.
    Why, this is
 hire and salary, not revenge!
    He took my father grossly, full of bread,
    With all his crim
es broad blown, as flush as May;
    And how his audit stands, who knows save heaven?
    But in o
ur circumstance and course of thought,
    'Tis heavy with him; and am I then reveng'd,
    To tak
e him in the purging of his soul,
    When he is fit and seasoned for his passage?
    No.
    Up
, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent.
    When he is drunk asleep; or in his rage;
    Or in 
th' incestuous pleasure of his bed;
    At gaming, swearing, or about some act
    That has no rel
ish of salvation in't-
    Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,
    And that his soul
 may be as damn'd and black
    As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays.
    This physic but pro
longs thy sickly days.              Exit.
  King. [rises] My words fly up, my thoughts remain below
.
    Words without thoughts never to heaven go.             Exit.




Scene IV.
The Queen's 
closet.

Enter Queen and Polonius.

  Pol. He will come straight. Look you lay home to him.
   
 Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,
    And that your Grace hath screen'd and st
ood between
    Much heat and him. I'll silence me even here.
    Pray you be round with him.
  H
am. (within) Mother, mother, mother!
  Queen. I'll warrant you; fear me not. Withdraw; I hear him

coming.
                              [Polonius hides behind the arras.]

                       
   Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Now, mother, what's the matter?
  Queen. Hamlet, thou hast thy father mu
ch offended.
  Ham. Mother, you have my father much offended.
  Queen. Come, come, you answer with
 an idle tongue.
  Ham. Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
  Queen. Why, how now, Hamlet?

  Ham. What's the matter now?
  Queen. Have you forgot me?
  Ham. No, by the rood, not so!
    Y
ou are the Queen, your husband's brother's wife,
    And (would it were not so!) you are my mother.

  Queen. Nay, then I'll set those to you that can speak.
  Ham. Come, come, and sit you down. You
 shall not budge;
    You go not till I set you up a glass
    Where you may see the inmost part o
f you.
  Queen. What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murther me?
    Help, help, ho!
  Pol. [behind] 
What, ho! help, help, help!
  Ham. [draws] How now? a rat? Dead for a ducat, dead!
            [Ma
kes a pass through the arras and] kills Polonius.
  Pol. [behind] O, I am slain!
  Queen. O me, wh
at hast thou done?
  Ham. Nay, I know not. Is it the King?
  Queen. O, what a rash and bloody deed
 is this!
  Ham. A bloody deed- almost as bad, good mother,
    As kill a king, and marry with his
 brother.
  Queen. As kill a king?
  Ham. Ay, lady, it was my word.
                         [Lif
ts up the arras and sees Polonius.]
    Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
    I took 
thee for thy better. Take thy fortune.
    Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.
    Leave w
ringing of your hands. Peace! sit you down
    And let me wring your heart; for so I shall
    If 
it be made of penetrable stuff;
    If damned custom have not braz'd it so
    That it is proof an
d bulwark against sense.
  Queen. What have I done that thou dar'st wag thy tongue
    In noise so
 rude against me?
  Ham. Such an act
    That blurs the grace and blush of modesty;
    Calls vir
tue hypocrite; takes off the rose
    From the fair forehead of an innocent love,
    And sets a b
lister there; makes marriage vows
    As false as dicers' oaths. O, such a deed
    As from the bo
dy of contraction plucks
    The very soul, and sweet religion makes
    A rhapsody of words! Heav
en's face doth glow;
    Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
    With tristful visage, as agains
t the doom,
    Is thought-sick at the act.
  Queen. Ah me, what act,
    That roars so loud and 
thunders in the index?
  Ham. Look here upon th's picture, and on this,
    The counterfeit presen
tment of two brothers.
    See what a grace was seated on this brow;
    Hyperion's curls; the fro
nt of Jove himself;
    An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
    A station like the herald M
ercury
    New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill:
    A combination and a form indeed
    Where ev
ery god did seem to set his seal
    To give the world assurance of a man.
    This was your husba
nd. Look you now what follows.
    Here is your husband, like a mildew'd ear
    Blasting his whol
esome brother. Have you eyes?
    Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
    And batten on
 this moor? Ha! have you eyes
    You cannot call it love; for at your age
    The heyday in the b
lood is tame, it's humble,
    And waits upon the judgment; and what judgment
    Would step from 
this to this? Sense sure you have,
    Else could you not have motion; but sure that sense
    Is 
apoplex'd; for madness would not err,
    Nor sense to ecstacy was ne'er so thrall'd
    But it re
serv'd some quantity of choice
    To serve in such a difference. What devil was't
    That thus h
ath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
    Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
    Ears withou
t hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
    Or but a sickly part of one true sense
    Could not so mo
pe.
    O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
    If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones
,
    To flaming youth let virtue be as wax
    And melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame
    W
hen the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
    Since frost itself as actively doth burn,
    And 
reason panders will.
  Queen. O Hamlet, speak no more!
    Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very sou
l,
    And there I see such black and grained spots
    As will not leave their tinct.
  Ham. Nay
, but to live
    In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
    Stew'd in corruption, honeying and mak
ing love
    Over the nasty sty!
  Queen. O, speak to me no more!
    These words like daggers en
ter in mine ears.
    No more, sweet Hamlet!
  Ham. A murtherer and a villain!
    A slave that i
s not twentieth part the tithe
    Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
    A cutpurse of the 
empire and the rule,
    That from a shelf the precious diadem stole
    And put it in his pocket!

  Queen. No more!

                Enter the Ghost in his nightgown.

  Ham. A king of shreds 
and patches!-
    Save me and hover o'er me with your wings,
    You heavenly guards! What would y
our gracious figure?
  Queen. Alas, he's mad!
  Ham. Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
   
 That, laps'd in time and passion, lets go by
    Th' important acting of your dread command?
    
O, say!
  Ghost. Do not forget. This visitation
    Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
  
  But look, amazement on thy mother sits.
    O, step between her and her fighting soul
    Concei
t in weakest bodies strongest works.
    Speak to her, Hamlet.
  Ham. How is it with you, lady?
 
 Queen. Alas, how is't with you,
    That you do bend your eye on vacancy,
    And with th' encorp
oral air do hold discourse?
    Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
    And, as the sleep
ing soldiers in th' alarm,
    Your bedded hairs, like life in excrements,
    Start up and stand 
an end. O gentle son,
    Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
    Sprinkle cool patience! Whe
reon do you look?
  Ham. On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!
    His form and cause conjo
in'd, preaching to stones,
    Would make them capable.- Do not look upon me,
    Lest with this p
iteous action you convert
    My stern effects. Then what I have to do
    Will want true colour- 
tears perchance for blood.
  Queen. To whom do you speak this?
  Ham. Do you see nothing there?
 
 Queen. Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
  Ham. Nor did you nothing hear?
  Queen. No, nothi
ng but ourselves.
  Ham. Why, look you there! Look how it steals away!
    My father, in his habit
 as he liv'd!
    Look where he goes even now out at the portal!
                                 
                    Exit Ghost.
  Queen. This is the very coinage of your brain.
    This bodiless
 creation ecstasy
    Is very cunning in.
  Ham. Ecstasy?
    My pulse as yours doth temperately 
keep time
    And makes as healthful music. It is not madness
    That I have utt'red. Bring me to
 the test,
    And I the matter will reword; which madness
    Would gambol from. Mother, for love
 of grace,
    Lay not that flattering unction to your soul
    That not your trespass but my madn
ess speaks.
    It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
    Whiles rank corruption, mining a
ll within,
    Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
    Repent what's past; avoid what is t
o come;
    And do not spread the compost on the weeds
    To make them ranker. Forgive me this my
 virtue;
    For in the fatness of these pursy times
    Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg-
 
   Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.
  Queen. O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain
.
  Ham. O, throw away the worser part of it,
    And live the purer with the other half,
    Goo
d night- but go not to my uncle's bed.
    Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
    That monster, 
custom, who all sense doth eat
    Of habits evil, is angel yet in this,
    That to the use of ac
tions fair and good
    He likewise gives a frock or livery,
    That aptly is put on. Refrain to-
night,
    And that shall lend a kind of easiness
    To the next abstinence; the next more easy;

    For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
    And either [master] the devil, or throw him
 out
    With wondrous potency. Once more, good night;
    And when you are desirous to be blest,

    I'll blessing beg of you.- For this same lord,
    I do repent; but heaven hath pleas'd it so,

    To punish me with this, and this with me,
    That I must be their scourge and minister.
   
 I will bestow him, and will answer well
    The death I gave him. So again, good night.
    I mus
t be cruel, only to be kind;
    Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.
    One word more, goo
d lady.
  Queen. What shall I do?
  Ham. Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
    Let the bl
oat King tempt you again to bed;
    Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
    And let h
im, for a pair of reechy kisses,
    Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,
    Make yo
u to ravel all this matter out,
    That I essentially am not in madness,
    But mad in craft. 'T
were good you let him know;
    For who that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
    Would from a pa
ddock, from a bat, a gib
    Such dear concernings hide? Who would do so?
    No, in despite of se
nse and secrecy,
    Unpeg the basket on the house's top,
    Let the birds fly, and like the famo
us ape,
    To try conclusions, in the basket creep
    And break your own neck down.
  Queen. Be
 thou assur'd, if words be made of breath,
    And breath of life, I have no life to breathe
    W
hat thou hast said to me.
  Ham. I must to England; you know that?
  Queen. Alack,
    I had forg
ot! 'Tis so concluded on.
  Ham. There's letters seal'd; and my two schoolfellows,
    Whom I will
 trust as I will adders fang'd,
    They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way
    And marshal 
me to knavery. Let it work;
    For 'tis the sport to have the enginer
    Hoist with his own peta
r; and 't shall go hard
    But I will delve one yard below their mines
    And blow them at the m
oon. O, 'tis most sweet
    When in one line two crafts directly meet.
    This man shall set me p
acking.
    I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.-
    Mother, good night.- Indeed, this coun
sellor
    Is now most still, most secret, and most grave,
    Who was in life a foolish peating k
nave.
    Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.
    Good night, mother.
                  [E
xit the Queen. Then] Exit Hamlet, tugging in
                                                      
 Polonius.

ACT IV. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King and 
Queen, with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  King. There's matter in these sighs. These profound h
eaves
    You must translate; 'tis fit we understand them.
    Where is your son?
  Queen. Bestow
 this place on us a little while.
                          [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]

    Ah, mine own lord, what have I seen to-night!
  King. What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
  Quee
n. Mad as the sea and wind when both contend
    Which is the mightier. In his lawless fit
    Beh
ind the arras hearing something stir,
    Whips out his rapier, cries 'A rat, a rat!'
    And in t
his brainish apprehension kills
    The unseen good old man.
  King. O heavy deed!
    It had bee
n so with us, had we been there.
    His liberty is full of threats to all-
    To you yourself, t
o us, to every one.
    Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
    It will be laid to us, w
hose providence
    Should have kept short, restrain'd, and out of haunt
    This mad young man. B
ut so much was our love
    We would not understand what was most fit,
    But, like the owner of 
a foul disease,
    To keep it from divulging, let it feed
    Even on the pith of life. Where is 
he gone?
  Queen. To draw apart the body he hath kill'd;
    O'er whom his very madness, like some
 ore
    Among a mineral of metals base,
    Shows itself pure. He weeps for what is done.
  King
. O Gertrude, come away!
    The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch
    But we will ship him 
hence; and this vile deed
    We must with all our majesty and skill
    Both countenance and excu
se. Ho, Guildenstern!

             Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

    Friends both, go jo
in you with some further aid.
    Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
    And from his mother's
 closet hath he dragg'd him.
    Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body
    Into the chap
el. I pray you haste in this.
                          Exeunt [Rosencrantz and Guildenstern].
   
 Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends
    And let them know both what we mean to do
  
  And what's untimely done. [So haply slander-]
    Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter,
    A
s level as the cannon to his blank,
    Transports his poisoned shot- may miss our name
    And hi
t the woundless air.- O, come away!
    My soul is full of discord and dismay.
                   
                                      Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A passage in the Castle.


Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Safely stow'd.
  Gentlemen. (within) Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!
  Ham. But s
oft! What noise? Who calls on Hamlet? O, here they
come.

               Enter Rosencrantz and Gu
ildenstern.

  Ros. What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
  Ham. Compounded it with du
st, whereto 'tis kin.
  Ros. Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
    And bear it to the
 chapel.
  Ham. Do not believe it.
  Ros. Believe what?
  Ham. That I can keep your counsel, and 
not mine own. Besides,
to be
    demanded of a sponge, what replication should be made by the
son

    of a king?
  Ros. Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
  Ham. Ay, sir; that soaks up the King'
s countenance, his
rewards,
    his authorities. But such officers do the King best service
in
 
   the end. He keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his
jaw;
    first mouth'd, to be last sw
allowed. When he needs what you
have
    glean'd, it is but squeezing you and, sponge, you shall b
e
dry
    again.
  Ros. I understand you not, my lord.
  Ham. I am glad of it. A knavish speech 
sleeps in a foolish ear.
  Ros. My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us
to
   
 the King.
  Ham. The body is with the King, but the King is not with the
body.
    The King is a
 thing-
  Guil. A thing, my lord?
  Ham. Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.
  
                                                       Exeunt.




Scene III.
Elsinore. A room
 in the Castle.

Enter King.

  King. I have sent to seek him and to find the body.
    How dan
gerous is it that this man goes loose!
    Yet must not we put the strong law on him.
    He's lov
'd of the distracted multitude,
    Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;
    And where 
'tis so, th' offender's scourge is weigh'd,
    But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,

    This sudden sending him away must seem
    Deliberate pause. Diseases desperate grown
    By
 desperate appliance are reliev'd,
    Or not at all.

                    Enter Rosencrantz.


    How now O What hath befall'n?
  Ros. Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
    We cannot g
et from him.
  King. But where is he?
  Ros. Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
  
King. Bring him before us.
  Ros. Ho, Guildenstern! Bring in my lord.

        Enter Hamlet and G
uildenstern [with Attendants].

  King. Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
  Ham. At supper.
  King.
 At supper? Where?
  Ham. Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A certain
    convocation of p
olitic worms are e'en at him. Your worm is
your
    only emperor for diet. We fat all creatures el
se to fat us,
and
    we fat ourselves for maggots. Your fat king and your lean
beggar
    is bu
t variable service- two dishes, but to one table. That's
the
    end.
  King. Alas, alas!
  Ham.
 A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and
eat
    of the fish that hath fed of th
at worm.
  King. What dost thou mean by this?
  Ham. Nothing but to show you how a king may go a p
rogress
through
    the guts of a beggar.
  King. Where is Polonius?
  Ham. In heaven. Send thit
her to see. If your messenger find him
not
    there, seek him i' th' other place yourself. But in
deed, if
you
    find him not within this month, you shall nose him as you go
up
    the stair, 
into the lobby.
  King. Go seek him there. [To Attendants.]
  Ham. He will stay till you come.
  
                                          [Exeunt Attendants.]
  King. Hamlet, this deed, for thine
 especial safety,-
    Which we do tender as we dearly grieve
    For that which thou hast done,- 
must send thee hence
    With fiery quickness. Therefore prepare thyself.
    The bark is ready an
d the wind at help,
    Th' associates tend, and everything is bent
    For England.
  Ham. For E
ngland?
  King. Ay, Hamlet.
  Ham. Good.
  King. So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
  Ham. 
I see a cherub that sees them. But come, for England!
    Farewell, dear mother.
  King. Thy lovin
g father, Hamlet.
  Ham. My mother! Father and mother is man and wife; man and wife
is
    one fl
esh; and so, my mother. Come, for England!
Exit.
  King. Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed 
aboard.
    Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night.
    Away! for everything is seal'd and don
e
    That else leans on th' affair. Pray you make haste.
                            Exeunt Rosen
crantz and Guildenstern]
    And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught,-
    As my great powe
r thereof may give thee sense,
    Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
    After the Danish 
sword, and thy free awe
    Pays homage to us,- thou mayst not coldly set
    Our sovereign proces
s, which imports at full,
    By letters congruing to that effect,
    The present death of Hamlet
. Do it, England;
    For like the hectic in my blood he rages,
    And thou must cure me. Till I 
know 'tis done,
    Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.             Exit.

Scene IV.
Near Elsinore.

Enter Fortinbras with his Army over the stage.

  For. Go, Captain
, from me greet the Danish king.
    Tell him that by his license Fortinbras
    Craves the convey
ance of a promis'd march
    Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.
    If that his Majesty wo
uld aught with us,
    We shall express our duty in his eye;
    And let him know so.
  Capt. I w
ill do't, my lord.
  For. Go softly on.
                                   Exeunt [all but the Cap
tain].

       Enter Hamlet, Rosencrantz, [Guildenstern,] and others.

  Ham. Good sir, whose po
wers are these?
  Capt. They are of Norway, sir.
  Ham. How purpos'd, sir, I pray you?
  Capt. Ag
ainst some part of Poland.
  Ham. Who commands them, sir?
  Capt. The nephew to old Norway, Fortin
bras.
  Ham. Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
    Or for some frontier?
  Capt. Truly to 
speak, and with no addition,
    We go to gain a little patch of ground
    That hath in it no pro
fit but the name.
    To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
    Nor will it yield to Norw
ay or the Pole
    A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
  Ham. Why, then the Polack never will
 defend it.
  Capt. Yes, it is already garrison'd.
  Ham. Two thousand souls and twenty thousand d
ucats
    Will not debate the question of this straw.
    This is th' imposthume of much wealth an
d peace,
    That inward breaks, and shows no cause without
    Why the man dies.- I humbly thank 
you, sir.
  Capt. God b' wi' you, sir.                             [Exit.]
  Ros. Will't please yo
u go, my lord?
  Ham. I'll be with you straight. Go a little before.
                             
           [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]
    How all occasions do inform against me
    And spur my dul
l revenge! What is a man,
    If his chief good and market of his time
    Be but to sleep and fee
d? A beast, no more.
    Sure he that made us with such large discourse,
    Looking before and af
ter, gave us not
    That capability and godlike reason
    To fust in us unus'd. Now, whether it 
be
    Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple
    Of thinking too precisely on th' event,-
    
A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
    And ever three parts coward,- I do not kno
w
    Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do,'
    Sith I have cause, and will, and strength, a
nd means
    To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me.
    Witness this army of such mass and ch
arge,
    Led by a delicate and tender prince,
    Whose spirit, with divine ambition puff'd,
   
 Makes mouths at the invisible event,
    Exposing what is mortal and unsure
    To all that fortu
ne, death, and danger dare,
    Even for an eggshell. Rightly to be great
    Is not to stir witho
ut great argument,
    But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
    When honour's at the stake. How 
stand I then,
    That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,
    Excitements of my reason and my
 blood,
    And let all sleep, while to my shame I see
    The imminent death of twenty thousand m
en
    That for a fantasy and trick of fame
    Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot
  
  Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
    Which is not tomb enough and continent
    To hide
 the slain? O, from this time forth,
    My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!            Exi
t.

Scene V.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter Horatio, Queen, and a Gen
tleman.

  Queen. I will not speak with her.
  Gent. She is importunate, indeed distract.
    He
r mood will needs be pitied.
  Queen. What would she have?
  Gent. She speaks much of her father; 
says she hears
    There's tricks i' th' world, and hems, and beats her heart;
    Spurns enviousl
y at straws; speaks things in doubt,
    That carry but half sense. Her speech is nothing,
    Yet
 the unshaped use of it doth move
    The hearers to collection; they aim at it,
    And botch the
 words up fit to their own thoughts;
    Which, as her winks and nods and gestures yield them,
   
 Indeed would make one think there might be thought,
    Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.

  Hor. 'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew
    Dangerous conjectures in ill-breedin
g minds.
  Queen. Let her come in.
                                               [Exit Gentleman.
]
    [Aside] To my sick soul (as sin's true nature is)
    Each toy seems Prologue to some great 
amiss.
    So full of artless jealousy is guilt
    It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.

  
               Enter Ophelia distracted.

  Oph. Where is the beauteous Majesty of Denmark?
  Que
en. How now, Ophelia?
  Oph. (sings)
         How should I your true-love know
           From an
other one?
         By his cockle bat and' staff
           And his sandal shoon.

  Queen. Alas
, sweet lady, what imports this song?
  Oph. Say you? Nay, pray You mark.

    (Sings) He is dead
 and gone, lady,
              He is dead and gone;
            At his head a grass-green turf,
 
             At his heels a stone.

    O, ho!
  Queen. Nay, but Ophelia-
  Oph. Pray you mark.


    (Sings) White his shroud as the mountain snow-

                    Enter King.

  Queen.
 Alas, look here, my lord!
  Oph. (Sings)
           Larded all with sweet flowers;
         Whic
h bewept to the grave did not go
           With true-love showers.

  King. How do you, pretty l
ady?
  Oph. Well, God dild you! They say the owl was a baker's
daughter.
    Lord, we know what w
e are, but know not what we may be. God
be at
    your table!
  King. Conceit upon her father.
 
 Oph. Pray let's have no words of this; but when they ask, you
what
    it means, say you this:


    (Sings) To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,
              All in the morning bedtime,
       
     And I a maid at your window,
              To be your Valentine.

            Then up he ros
e and donn'd his clo'es
              And dupp'd the chamber door,
            Let in the maid, th
at out a maid
              Never departed more.

  King. Pretty Ophelia!
  Oph. Indeed, la, wit
hout an oath, I'll make an end on't!

    [Sings] By Gis and by Saint Charity,
              Alac
k, and fie for shame!
            Young men will do't if they come to't
              By Cock, the
y are to blame.

            Quoth she, 'Before you tumbled me,
              You promis'd me to 
wed.'

    He answers:

            'So would I 'a' done, by yonder sun,
              An thou 
hadst not come to my bed.'

  King. How long hath she been thus?
  Oph. I hope all will be well. 
We must be patient; but I cannot
    choose but weep to think they would lay him i' th' cold
groun
d.
    My brother shall know of it; and so I thank you for your good
    counsel. Come, my coach! 
Good night, ladies. Good night,
sweet
    ladies. Good night, good night.                         
Exit
  King. Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.
                                  
               [Exit Horatio.]

    O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs
    All from 
her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
    When sorrows come, they come not single spies.
    B
ut in battalions! First, her father slain;
    Next, your son gone, and he most violent author
   
 Of his own just remove; the people muddied,
    Thick and and unwholesome in their thoughts and wh
ispers
    For good Polonius' death, and we have done but greenly
    In hugger-mugger to inter hi
m; poor Ophelia
    Divided from herself and her fair judgment,
    Without the which we are pictu
res or mere beasts;
    Last, and as much containing as all these,
    Her brother is in secret co
me from France;
    And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
    Feeds on his wonder, keep, himself
 in clouds,
    With pestilent speeches of his father's death,
    Wherein necessity, of matter be
ggar'd,
    Will nothing stick our person to arraign
    In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,

    Like to a murd'ring piece, in many places
    Give me superfluous death.                  A n
oise within.
  Queen. Alack, what noise is this?
  King. Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the
 door.

                     Enter a Messenger.

    What is the matter?
  Mess. Save Yourself,
 my lord:
    The ocean, overpeering of his list,
    Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste

    Than Young Laertes, in a riotous head,
    O'erbears Your offices. The rabble call him lord;

    And, as the world were now but to begin,
    Antiquity forgot, custom not known,
    The rati
fiers and props of every word,
    They cry 'Choose we! Laertes shall be king!'
    Caps, hands, a
nd tongues applaud it to the clouds,
    'Laertes shall be king! Laertes king!'
                  
                               A noise within.
  Queen. How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!

    O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!
  King. The doors are broke.

                  
  Enter Laertes with others.

  Laer. Where is this king?- Sirs, staid you all without.
  All. No
, let's come in!
  Laer. I pray you give me leave.
  All. We will, we will!
  Laer. I thank you. 
Keep the door.      [Exeunt his Followers.]
    O thou vile king,
    Give me my father!
  Queen.
 Calmly, good Laertes.
  Laer. That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard;
    Cries cuck
old to my father; brands the harlot
    Even here between the chaste unsmirched brows
    Of my tr
ue mother.
  King. What is the cause, Laertes,
    That thy rebellion looks so giantlike?
    Let
 him go, Gertrude. Do not fear our person.
    There's such divinity doth hedge a king
    That tr
eason can but peep to what it would,
    Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,
    Why thou a
rt thus incens'd. Let him go, Gertrude.
    Speak, man.
  Laer. Where is my father?
  King. Dead.

  Queen. But not by him!
  King. Let him demand his fill.
  Laer. How came he dead? I'll not be 
juggled with:
    To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil
    Conscience and grace, to th
e profoundest pit!
    I dare damnation. To this point I stand,
    That both the world, I give to
 negligence,
    Let come what comes; only I'll be reveng'd
    Most throughly for my father.
  K
ing. Who shall stay you?
  Laer. My will, not all the world!
    And for my means, I'll husband th
em so well
    They shall go far with little.
  King. Good Laertes,
    If you desire to know the
 certainty
    Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge
    That sweepstake you will
 draw both friend and foe,
    Winner and loser?
  Laer. None but his enemies.
  King. Will you k
now them then?
  Laer. To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms
    And, like the kind life-
rend'ring pelican,
    Repast them with my blood.
  King. Why, now You speak
    Like a good chil
d and a true gentleman.
    That I am guiltless of your father's death,
    And am most sensibly i
n grief for it,
    It shall as level to your judgment pierce
    As day does to your eye.
      
                        A noise within: 'Let her come in.'
  Laer. How now? What noise is that?


                      Enter Ophelia.

    O heat, dry up my brains! Tears seven times salt
    Bu
rn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!
    By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight
    Ti
ll our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!
    Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
    O heaven
s! is't possible a young maid's wits
    Should be as mortal as an old man's life?
    Nature is f
ine in love, and where 'tis fine,
    It sends some precious instance of itself
    After the thin
g it loves.

  Oph. (sings)
         They bore him barefac'd on the bier
           (Hey non non
y, nony, hey nony)
         And in his grave rain'd many a tear.

    Fare you well, my dove!
  
Laer. Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
    It could not move thus.
  Oph. You must
 sing 'A-down a-down, and you call him a-down-a.'
O,
    how the wheel becomes it! It is the false
 steward, that stole
his
    master's daughter.
  Laer. This nothing's more than matter.
  Oph. 
There's rosemary, that's for remembrance. Pray you, love,
    remember. And there is pansies, that'
s for thoughts.
  Laer. A document in madness! Thoughts and remembrance fitted.
  Oph. There's fen
nel for you, and columbines. There's rue for
you,
    and here's some for me. We may call it herb 
of grace o'
Sundays.
    O, you must wear your rue with a difference! There's a daisy.
I
    wou
ld give you some violets, but they wither'd all when my
father
    died. They say he made a good e
nd.

    [Sings] For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.

  Laer. Thought and affliction, passion, 
hell itself,
    She turns to favour and to prettiness.
  Oph. (sings)
         And will he not c
ome again?
         And will he not come again?
           No, no, he is dead;
           Go to t
hy deathbed;
         He never will come again.

         His beard was as white as snow,
      
   All flaxen was his poll.
           He is gone, he is gone,
           And we cast away moan.

         God 'a'mercy on his soul!

    And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God b' wi' you.
E
xit.
  Laer. Do you see this, O God?
  King. Laertes, I must commune with your grief,
    Or you 
deny me right. Go but apart,
    Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will,
    And they sh
all hear and judge 'twixt you and me.
    If by direct or by collateral hand
    They find us touc
h'd, we will our kingdom give,
    Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours,
    To you in s
atisfaction; but if not,
    Be you content to lend your patience to us,
    And we shall jointly 
labour with your soul
    To give it due content.
  Laer. Let this be so.
    His means of death,
 his obscure funeral-
    No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,
    No noble rite nor fo
rmal ostentation,-
    Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
    That I must call't in 
question.
  King. So you shall;
    And where th' offence is let the great axe fall.
    I pray y
ou go with me.
                                                          Exeunt

 some means to the King. They have

f

    slow of sail, we put on 
a compelled valour, and in the
grapple I
    boarded them. On the instant they got clear of our sh
ip; so I
    alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with me like
thieves
    of mercy; but 
they knew what they did: I am to do a good turn
for
    them. Let the King have the letters I have
 sent, and repair
thou

words
    
to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb; yet are they much

Scene VII.
Elsinore. Another room in the Castle.

Enter King and Lae
rtes.

  King. Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
    And You must put me in your hear
t for friend,
    Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
    That he which hath your noble f
ather slain
    Pursued my life.
  Laer. It well appears. But tell me
    Why you proceeded not a
gainst these feats
    So crimeful and so capital in nature,
    As by your safety, wisdom, all th
ings else,
    You mainly were stirr'd up.
  King. O, for two special reasons,
    Which may to y
ou, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,
    But yet to me they are strong. The Queen his mother
    Live
s almost by his looks; and for myself,-
    My virtue or my plague, be it either which,-
    She's
 so conjunctive to my life and soul
    That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
    I could
 not but by her. The other motive
    Why to a public count I might not go
    Is the great love t
he general gender bear him,
    Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
    Would, like th
e spring that turneth wood to stone,
    Convert his gives to graces; so that my arrows,
    Too s
lightly timber'd for so loud a wind,
    Would have reverted to my bow again,
    And not where I 
had aim'd them.
  Laer. And so have I a noble father lost;
    A sister driven into desp'rate term
s,
    Whose worth, if praises may go back again,
    Stood challenger on mount of all the age
  
  For her perfections. But my revenge will come.
  King. Break not your sleeps for that. You must n
ot think
    That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
    That we can let our beard be shook wit
h danger,
    And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more.
    I lov'd your father, and we l
ove ourself,
    And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine-

                 Enter a Messenger
 with letters.

    How now? What news?
  Mess. Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:
    This to your 
Majesty; this to the Queen.
  King. From Hamlet? Who brought them?
  Mess. Sailors, my lord, they 
say; I saw them not.
    They were given me by Claudio; he receiv'd them
    Of him that brought t
hem.
  King. Laertes, you shall hear them.
    Leave us.
                                        
         Exit Messenger.
    [Reads]'High and Mighty,-You shall know I am set naked on
your
    k
ingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes;
    when I shall (first asking your pa
rdon thereunto) recount the
    occasion of my sudden and more strange return.
                   
                                  'HAMLET.'
    What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?

    Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?
  Laer. Know you the hand?
  King. 'Tis Hamlet's char
acter. 'Naked!'
    And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'
    Can you advise me?
  Laer. I a
m lost in it, my lord. But let him come!
    It warms the very sickness in my heart
    That I sha
ll live and tell him to his teeth,
    'Thus didest thou.'
  King. If it be so, Laertes
    (As h
ow should it be so? how otherwise?),
    Will you be rul'd by me?
  Laer. Ay my lord,
    So you 
will not o'errule me to a peace.
  King. To thine own peace. If he be now return'd
    As checking
 at his voyage, and that he means
    No more to undertake it, I will work him
    To exploit now 
ripe in my device,
    Under the which he shall not choose but fall;
    And for his death no wind
 shall breathe
    But even his mother shall uncharge the practice
    And call it accident.
  La
er. My lord, I will be rul'd;
    The rather, if you could devise it so
    That I might be the or
gan.
  King. It falls right.
    You have been talk'd of since your travel much,
    And that in 
Hamlet's hearing, for a quality
    Wherein they say you shine, Your sum of parts
    Did not toge
ther pluck such envy from him
    As did that one; and that, in my regard,
    Of the unworthiest 
siege.
  Laer. What part is that, my lord?
  King. A very riband in the cap of youth-
    Yet nee
dfull too; for youth no less becomes
    The light and careless livery that it wears
    Than sett
led age his sables and his weeds,
    Importing health and graveness. Two months since
    Here wa
s a gentleman of Normandy.
    I have seen myself, and serv'd against, the French,
    And they ca
n well on horseback; but this gallant
    Had witchcraft in't. He grew unto his seat,
    And to s
uch wondrous doing brought his horse
    As had he been incorps'd and demi-natur'd
    With the br
ave beast. So far he topp'd my thought
    That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
    Come short
 of what he did.
  Laer. A Norman was't?
  King. A Norman.
  Laer. Upon my life, Lamound.
  King
. The very same.
  Laer. I know him well. He is the broach indeed
    And gem of all the nation.

  King. He made confession of you;
    And gave you such a masterly report
    For art and exercis
e in your defence,
    And for your rapier most especially,
    That he cried out 'twould be a sig
ht indeed
    If one could match you. The scrimers of their nation
    He swore had neither motion
, guard, nor eye,
    If you oppos'd them. Sir, this report of his
    Did Hamlet so envenom with 
his envy
    That he could nothing do but wish and beg
    Your sudden coming o'er to play with yo
u.
    Now, out of this-
  Laer. What out of this, my lord?
  King. Laertes, was your father dear
 to you?
    Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
    A face without a heart,'
  Laer. Why a
sk you this?
  King. Not that I think you did not love your father;
    But that I know love is be
gun by time,
    And that I see, in passages of proof,
    Time qualifies the spark and fire of it
.
    There lives within the very flame of love
    A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
 
   And nothing is at a like goodness still;
    For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
    Dies in hi
s own too-much. That we would do,
    We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes,
    An
d hath abatements and delays as many
    As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
    And t
hen this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
    That hurts by easing. But to the quick o' th' ulc
er!
    Hamlet comes back. What would you undertake
    To show yourself your father's son in deed

    More than in words?
  Laer. To cut his throat i' th' church!
  King. No place indeed should 
murther sanctuarize;
    Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,
    Will you do this? K
eep close within your chamber.
    Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home.
    We'll put on 
those shall praise your excellence
    And set a double varnish on the fame
    The Frenchman gave
 you; bring you in fine together
    And wager on your heads. He, being remiss,
    Most generous,
 and free from all contriving,
    Will not peruse the foils; so that with ease,
    Or with a lit
tle shuffling, you may choose
    A sword unbated, and, in a pass of practice,
    Requite him for
 your father.
  Laer. I will do't!
    And for that purpose I'll anoint my sword.
    I bought an
 unction of a mountebank,
    So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
    Where it draws blood no c
ataplasm so rare,
    Collected from all simples that have virtue
    Under the moon, can save the
 thing from death
    This is but scratch'd withal. I'll touch my point
    With this contagion, t
hat, if I gall him slightly,
    It may be death.
  King. Let's further think of this,
    Weigh 
what convenience both of time and means
    May fit us to our shape. If this should fall,
    And 
that our drift look through our bad performance.
    'Twere better not assay'd. Therefore this proj
ect
    Should have a back or second, that might hold
    If this did blast in proof. Soft! let me
 see.
    We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings-
    I ha't!
    When in your motion you are
 hot and dry-
    As make your bouts more violent to that end-
    And that he calls for drink, I'
ll have prepar'd him
    A chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,
    If he by chance escape 
your venom'd stuck,
    Our purpose may hold there.- But stay, what noise,

                     
      Enter Queen.

    How now, sweet queen?
  Queen. One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
 
   So fast they follow. Your sister's drown'd, Laertes.
  Laer. Drown'd! O, where?
  Queen. There 
is a willow grows aslant a brook,
    That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream.
    There w
ith fantastic garlands did she come
    Of crowflowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,
    Th
at liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
    But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them.

    There on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds
    Clamb'ring to hang, an envious sliver broke,

    When down her weedy trophies and herself
    Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wid
e
    And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up;
    Which time she chaunted snatches of old tune
s,
    As one incapable of her own distress,
    Or like a creature native and indued
    Unto th
at element; but long it could not be
    Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
    Pull'
d the poor wretch from her melodious lay
    To muddy death.
  Laer. Alas, then she is drown'd?
 
 Queen. Drown'd, drown'd.
  Laer. Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
    And therefore I f
orbid my tears; but yet
    It is our trick; nature her custom holds,
    Let shame say what it wi
ll. When these are gone,
    The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord.
    I have a speech of fire, t
hat fain would blaze
    But that this folly douts it.                          Exit.
  King. Let'
s follow, Gertrude.
    How much I had to do to calm his rage I
    Now fear I this will give it s
tart again;
    Therefore let's follow.
                                                         E

ACT V. Scene I.
Elsinore. A churchyard.

Enter two Clowns, [with spad
es and pickaxes].

  Clown. Is she to be buried in Christian burial when she
wilfully
    seeks 
her own salvation?
  Other. I tell thee she is; therefore make her grave straight.
    The crowner
 hath sate on her, and finds it Christian burial.
  Clown. How can that be, unless she drown'd hers
elf in her own
    defence?
  Other. Why, 'tis found so.
  Clown. It must be se offendendo; it ca
nnot be else. For here
lies
    the point: if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act; and
an

    act hath three branches-it is to act, to do, and to perform;
    argal, she drown'd herself wi
ttingly.
  Other. Nay, but hear you, Goodman Delver!
  Clown. Give me leave. Here lies the water; 
good. Here stands
the
    man; good. If the man go to this water and drown himself, it
is,
    w
ill he nill he, he goes- mark you that. But if the water
come to
    him and drown him, he drowns 
not himself. Argal, he that is
not
    guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.
  Other
. But is this law?
  Clown. Ay, marry, is't- crowner's quest law.
  Other. Will you ha' the truth 
an't? If this had not been a
    gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o' Christian
burial.

  Clown. Why, there thou say'st! And the more pity that great
folk
    should have count'nance i
n this world to drown or hang
themselves
    more than their even-Christian. Come, my spade! There
 is no
    ancient gentlemen but gard'ners, ditchers, and grave-makers.
They
    hold up Adam's p
rofession.
  Other. Was he a gentleman?
  Clown. 'A was the first that ever bore arms.
  Other. W
hy, he had none.
  Clown. What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the
Scripture?
    The Sc
ripture says Adam digg'd. Could he dig without arms?
I'll
    put another question to thee. If tho
u answerest me not to the
    purpose, confess thyself-
  Other. Go to!
  Clown. What is he that 
builds stronger than either the mason,
the
    shipwright, or the carpenter?
  Other. The gallows
-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand
    tenants.
  Clown. I like thy wit well, in good fait
h. The gallows does
well.
    But how does it well? It does well to those that do ill. Now,
    t
hou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the
    church. Argal, the gallows may do we
ll to thee. To't again,
come!
  Other. Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a
    c
arpenter?
  Clown. Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
  Other. Marry, now I can tell!
  Clown. To't.

  Other. Mass, I cannot tell.

                 Enter Hamlet and Horatio afar off.

  Clown. Cud
gel thy brains no more about it, for your dull ass
will
    not mend his pace with beating; and wh
en you are ask'd this
    question next, say 'a grave-maker.' The houses he makes lasts
    till d
oomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan; fetch me a stoup of
    liquor.
                                
            [Exit Second Clown.]


                       [Clown digs and] sings.

       In yo
uth when I did love, did love,
         Methought it was very sweet;
       To contract- O- the ti
me for- a- my behove,
         O, methought there- a- was nothing- a- meet.

  Ham. Has this fell
ow no feeling of his business, that he sings
at
    grave-making?
  Hor. Custom hath made it in h
im a property of easiness.
  Ham. 'Tis e'en so. The hand of little employment hath the
daintier
 
   sense.
  Clown. (sings)
         But age with his stealing steps
           Hath clawed me in 
his clutch,
         And hath shipped me intil the land,
           As if I had never been such.

                                            [Throws up a skull.]

  Ham. That skull had a tongue i
n it, and could sing once. How
the
    knave jowls it to the ground,as if 'twere Cain's jawbone,

that
    did the first murther! This might be the pate of a
Politician,
    which this ass now o'
erreaches; one that would circumvent
God,
    might it not?
  Hor. It might, my lord.
  Ham. Or 
of a courtier, which could say 'Good morrow, sweet
lord!
    How dost thou, good lord?' This might
 be my Lord Such-a-one,
that
    prais'd my Lord Such-a-one's horse when he meant to beg it-
migh
t
    it not?
  Hor. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Why, e'en so! and now my Lady Worm's, chapless, and
kno
ck'd
    about the mazzard with a sexton's spade. Here's fine
revolution,
    and we had the tric
k to see't. Did these bones cost no more
the
    breeding but to play at loggets with 'em? Mine ac
he to think
    on't.
  Clown. (Sings)
         A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,
           For a
nd a shrouding sheet;
         O, a Pit of clay for to be made
           For such a guest is meet
.
                                      Throws up [another skull].

  Ham. There's another. Why m
ay not that be the skull of a
lawyer?
    Where be his quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, his

tenures,
    and his tricks? Why does he suffer this rude knave now to
knock
    him about the s
conce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell
him
    of his action of battery? Hum! This fellow mi
ght be in's time
a
    great buyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizances,
his
    fines,
 his double vouchers, his recoveries. Is this the fine
of
    his fines, and the recovery of his r
ecoveries, to have his
fine
    pate full of fine dirt? Will his vouchers vouch him no more
of
 
   his purchases, and double ones too, than the length and
breadth
    of a pair of indentures? Th
e very conveyances of his lands
will
    scarcely lie in this box; and must th' inheritor himself 
have
no
    more, ha?
  Hor. Not a jot more, my lord.
  Ham. Is not parchment made of sheepskins
?
  Hor. Ay, my lord, And of calveskins too.
  Ham. They are sheep and calves which seek out assur
ance in
that. I
    will speak to this fellow. Whose grave's this, sirrah?
  Clown. Mine, sir.


    [Sings] O, a pit of clay for to be made
              For such a guest is meet.

  Ham. I th
ink it be thine indeed, for thou liest in't.
  Clown. You lie out on't, sir, and therefore 'tis not
 yours.
    For my part, I do not lie in't, yet it is mine.
  Ham. Thou dost lie in't, to be in't 
and say it is thine. 'Tis
for
    the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.
  Clown. 'Ti
s a quick lie, sir; 'twill away again from me to you.
  Ham. What man dost thou dig it for?
  Clow
n. For no man, sir.
  Ham. What woman then?
  Clown. For none neither.
  Ham. Who is to be buried
 in't?
  Clown. One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's
dead.
  Ham. How absolute th
e knave is! We must speak by the card, or
    equivocation will undo us. By the Lord, Horatio, this
 three
years
    I have taken note of it, the age is grown so picked that the
toe
    of the pea
sant comes so near the heel of the courtier he
galls
    his kibe.- How long hast thou been a grav
e-maker?
  Clown. Of all the days i' th' year, I came to't that day that
our
    last king Hamlet
 overcame Fortinbras.
  Ham. How long is that since?
  Clown. Cannot you tell that? Every fool can
 tell that. It was
the
    very day that young Hamlet was born- he that is mad, and sent
    into
 England.
  Ham. Ay, marry, why was be sent into England?
  Clown. Why, because 'a was mad. 'A sha
ll recover his wits
there;
    or, if 'a do not, 'tis no great matter there.
  Ham. Why?
  Clown
. 'Twill not he seen in him there. There the men are as
mad as
    he.
  Ham. How came he mad?
 
 Clown. Very strangely, they say.
  Ham. How strangely?
  Clown. Faith, e'en with losing his wits.

  Ham. Upon what ground?
  Clown. Why, here in Denmark. I have been sexton here, man and
boy
  
  thirty years.
  Ham. How long will a man lie i' th' earth ere he rot?
  Clown. Faith, if 'a be n
ot rotten before 'a die (as we have
many
    pocky corses now-a-days that will scarce hold the lay
ing in,
I
    will last you some eight year or nine year. A tanner will
last
    you nine year.

  Ham. Why he more than another?
  Clown. Why, sir, his hide is so tann'd with his trade that 'a

will
    keep out water a great while; and your water is a sore
decayer of
    your whoreson dead
 body. Here's a skull now. This skull hath
lien
    you i' th' earth three-and-twenty years.
  Ha
m. Whose was it?
  Clown. A whoreson, mad fellow's it was. Whose do you think it
was?
  Ham. Nay,
 I know not.
  Clown. A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! 'A pour'd a flagon
of
    Rhenish on m
y head once. This same skull, sir, was Yorick's
    skull, the King's jester.
  Ham. This?
  Clow
n. E'en that.
  Ham. Let me see. [Takes the skull.] Alas, poor Yorick! I knew
him,
    Horatio. A
 fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy.
He
    hath borne me on his back a thousand tim
es. And now how
abhorred
    in my imagination it is! My gorge rises at it. Here hung
those
    
lips that I have kiss'd I know not how oft. Where be your
gibes
    now? your gambols? your songs?
 your flashes of merriment that
    were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock
you
r
    own grinning? Quite chap- fall'n? Now get you to my lady's
    chamber, and tell her, let he
r paint an inch thick, to this
    favour she must come. Make her laugh at that. Prithee,
Horatio,

    tell me one thing.
  Hor. What's that, my lord?
  Ham. Dost thou think Alexander look'd o' t
his fashion i' th'
earth?
  Hor. E'en so.
  Ham. And smelt so? Pah!
                            
              [Puts down the skull.]
  Hor. E'en so, my lord.
  Ham. To what base uses we may retu
rn, Horatio! Why may not
    imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it
    sto
pping a bunghole?
  Hor. 'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.
  Ham. No, faith, not a
 jot; but to follow him thither with
modesty
    enough, and likelihood to lead it; as thus: Alexa
nder died,
    Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust
is
    earth; of ear
th we make loam; and why of that loam (whereto
he
    was converted) might they not stop a beer ba
rrel?
    Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
    Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.

    O, that that earth which kept the world in awe
    Should patch a wall t' expel the winter's f
law!
    But soft! but soft! aside! Here comes the King-

    Enter [priests with] a coffin [in f
uneral procession], King,
             Queen, Laertes, with Lords attendant.]

    The Queen, the
 courtiers. Who is this they follow?
    And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken
    The cor
se they follow did with desp'rate hand
    Fordo it own life. 'Twas of some estate.
    Couch we a
while, and mark.
                                         [Retires with Horatio.]

  Laer. What c
eremony else?
  Ham. That is Laertes,
    A very noble youth. Mark.
  Laer. What ceremony else?

  Priest. Her obsequies have been as far enlarg'd
    As we have warranty. Her death was doubtful;

    And, but that great command o'ersways the order,
    She should in ground unsanctified have lo
dg'd
    Till the last trumpet. For charitable prayers,
    Shards, flints, and pebbles should be 
thrown on her.
    Yet here she is allow'd her virgin rites,
    Her maiden strewments, and the br
inging home
    Of bell and burial.
  Laer. Must there no more be done?
  Priest. No more be done
.
    We should profane the service of the dead
    To sing a requiem and such rest to her
    As
 to peace-parted souls.
  Laer. Lay her i' th' earth;
    And from her fair and unpolluted flesh

    May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,
    A minist'ring angel shall my sister be
 
   When thou liest howling.
  Ham. What, the fair Ophelia?
  Queen. Sweets to the sweet! Farewell.

                                             [Scatters flowers.]
    I hop'd thou shouldst have b
een my Hamlet's wife;
    I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
    And not have str
ew'd thy grave.
  Laer. O, treble woe
    Fall ten times treble on that cursed head
    Whose wic
ked deed thy most ingenious sense
    Depriv'd thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,
    Till I have
 caught her once more in mine arms.
                                             Leaps in the grave
.
    Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead
    Till of this flat a mountain you have made
 
   T' o'ertop old Pelion or the skyish head
    Of blue Olympus.
  Ham. [comes forward] What is he
 whose grief
    Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow
    Conjures the wand'ring stars, 
and makes them stand
    Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,
    Hamlet the Dane.             
       [Leaps in after Laertes.
  Laer. The devil take thy soul!
                                 
           [Grapples with him].
  Ham. Thou pray'st not well.
    I prithee take thy fingers from 
my throat;
    For, though I am not splenitive and rash,
    Yet have I in me something dangerous,

    Which let thy wisdom fear. Hold off thy hand!
  King. Pluck them asunder.
  Queen. Hamlet, H
amlet!
  All. Gentlemen!
  Hor. Good my lord, be quiet.
             [The Attendants part them, a
nd they come out of the
                                                         grave.]
  Ham. Wh
y, I will fight with him upon this theme
    Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
  Queen. O my so
n, what theme?
  Ham. I lov'd Ophelia. Forty thousand brothers
    Could not (with all their quant
ity of love)
    Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?
  King. O, he is mad, Laertes.
  Quee
n. For love of God, forbear him!
  Ham. 'Swounds, show me what thou't do.
    Woo't weep? woo't fi
ght? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?
    Woo't drink up esill? eat a crocodile?
    I'll do't. Dos
t thou come here to whine?
    To outface me with leaping in her grave?
    Be buried quick with h
er, and so will I.
    And if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
    Millions of acres on us,
 till our ground,
    Singeing his pate against the burning zone,
    Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, 
an thou'lt mouth,
    I'll rant as well as thou.
  Queen. This is mere madness;
    And thus a wh
ile the fit will work on him.
    Anon, as patient as the female dove
    When that her golden cou
plets are disclos'd,
    His silence will sit drooping.
  Ham. Hear you, sir!
    What is the rea
son that you use me thus?
    I lov'd you ever. But it is no matter.
    Let Hercules himself do w
hat he may,
    The cat will mew, and dog will have his day.
Exit.
  King. I pray thee, good Hora
tio, wait upon him.
                                                   Exit Horatio.
    [To Laert
es] Strengthen your patience in our last night's
speech.
    We'll put the matter to the present p
ush.-
    Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.-
    This grave shall have a living monumen
t.
    An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
    Till then in patience our proceeding be.
      
                                                   Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A hall in t
he Castle.

Enter Hamlet and Horatio.

  Ham. So much for this, sir; now shall you see the other
.
    You do remember all the circumstance?
  Hor. Remember it, my lord!
  Ham. Sir, in my heart 
there was a kind of fighting
    That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay
    Worse than the m
utinies in the bilboes. Rashly-
    And prais'd be rashness for it; let us know,
    Our indiscret
ion sometime serves us well
    When our deep plots do pall; and that should learn us
    There's 
a divinity that shapes our ends,
    Rough-hew them how we will-
  Hor. That is most certain.
  H
am. Up from my cabin,
    My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
    Grop'd I to find out them;
 had my desire,
    Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew
    To mine own room again; making
 so bold
    (My fears forgetting manners) to unseal
    Their grand commission; where I found, Ho
ratio
    (O royal knavery!), an exact command,
    Larded with many several sorts of reasons,
  
  Importing Denmark's health, and England's too,
    With, hoo! such bugs and goblins in my life-

    That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
    No, not to stay the finding of the axe,
    My h
ead should be struck off.
  Hor. Is't possible?
  Ham. Here's the commission; read it at more leis
ure.
    But wilt thou bear me how I did proceed?
  Hor. I beseech you.
  Ham. Being thus benette
d round with villanies,
    Or I could make a prologue to my brains,
    They had begun the play. 
I sat me down;
    Devis'd a new commission; wrote it fair.
    I once did hold it, as our statist
s do,
    A baseness to write fair, and labour'd much
    How to forget that learning; but, sir, n
ow
    It did me yeoman's service. Wilt thou know
    Th' effect of what I wrote?
  Hor. Ay, good
 my lord.
  Ham. An earnest conjuration from the King,
    As England was his faithful tributary,

    As love between them like the palm might flourish,
    As peace should still her wheaten garla
nd wear
    And stand a comma 'tween their amities,
    And many such-like as's of great charge,

    That, on the view and knowing of these contents,
    Without debatement further, more or less,

    He should the bearers put to sudden death,
    Not shriving time allow'd.
  Hor. How was this
 seal'd?
  Ham. Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
    I had my father's signet in my purse,

    Which was the model of that Danish seal;
    Folded the writ up in the form of th' other,
    
Subscrib'd it, gave't th' impression, plac'd it safely,
    The changeling never known. Now, the ne
xt day
    Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent
    Thou know'st already.
  Hor. So Gu
ildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.
  Ham. Why, man, they did make love to this employment!
    Th
ey are not near my conscience; their defeat
    Does by their own insinuation grow.
    'Tis dange
rous when the baser nature comes
    Between the pass and fell incensed points
    Of mighty oppos
ites.
  Hor. Why, what a king is this!
  Ham. Does it not, thinks't thee, stand me now upon-
    
He that hath kill'd my king, and whor'd my mother;
    Popp'd in between th' election and my hopes;

    Thrown out his angle for my proper life,
    And with such coz'nage- is't not perfect conscie
nce
    To quit him with this arm? And is't not to be damn'd
    To let this canker of our nature 
come
    In further evil?
  Hor. It must be shortly known to him from England
    What is the iss
ue of the business there.
  Ham. It will be short; the interim is mine,
    And a man's life is no
 more than to say 'one.'
    But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
    That to Laertes I forgot mysel
f,
    For by the image of my cause I see
    The portraiture of his. I'll court his favours.
   
 But sure the bravery of his grief did put me
    Into a tow'ring passion.
  Hor. Peace! Who comes
 here?

                 Enter young Osric, a courtier.

  Osr. Your lordship is right welcome b
ack to Denmark.
  Ham. I humbly thank you, sir. [Aside to Horatio] Dost know this
    waterfly?
 
 Hor. [aside to Hamlet] No, my good lord.
  Ham. [aside to Horatio] Thy state is the more gracious;
 for
'tis a
    vice to know him. He hath much land, and fertile. Let a beast
be
    lord of bea
sts, and his crib shall stand at the king's mess.
'Tis
    a chough; but, as I say, spacious in th
e possession of dirt.

  Osr. Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should
impart
    
a thing to you from his Majesty.
  Ham. I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit. Put

your
    bonnet to his right use. 'Tis for the head.
  Osr. I thank your lordship, it is very hot.

  Ham. No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly.
  Osr. It is indifferent cold, my l
ord, indeed.
  Ham. But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my
complexion.
  Osr. Exceedin
gly, my lord; it is very sultry, as 'twere- I
cannot
    tell how. But, my lord, his Majesty bade 
me signify to you
that
    he has laid a great wager on your head. Sir, this is the
matter-
  Ha
m. I beseech you remember.
                           [Hamlet moves him to put on his hat.]
  Osr.
 Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here
is
    newly come to court Laertes; be
lieve me, an absolute
gentleman,
    full of most excellent differences, of very soft society and

    great showing. Indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the
card
    or calendar of gentry; f
or you shall find in him the
continent of
    what part a gentleman would see.
  Ham. Sir, his de
finement suffers no perdition in you; though, I

    know, to divide him inventorially would dozy 
th' arithmetic
of
    memory, and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail.
    But, in t
he verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of
great
    article, and his infusion of such dea
rth and rareness as, to
make
    true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror, and who
else

    would trace him, his umbrage, nothing more.
  Osr. Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.

  Ham. The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our
more
    rawer breath?
  Osr. 
Sir?
  Hor [aside to Hamlet] Is't not possible to understand in
another
    tongue? You will do't
, sir, really.
  Ham. What imports the nomination of this gentleman?
  Osr. Of Laertes?
  Hor. [a
side] His purse is empty already. All's golden words are
    spent.
  Ham. Of him, sir.
  Osr. I 
know you are not ignorant-
  Ham. I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would
not
 
   much approve me. Well, sir?
  Osr. You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is-
  Ham. I
 dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in
    excellence; but to know a man well we
re to know himself.
  Osr. I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on
him
    by 
them, in his meed he's unfellowed.
  Ham. What's his weapon?
  Osr. Rapier and dagger.
  Ham. Tha
t's two of his weapons- but well.
  Osr. The King, sir, hath wager'd with him six Barbary horses;

    against the which he has impon'd, as I take it, six French
    rapiers and poniards, with their
 assigns, as girdle, hangers,
and
    so. Three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy
,
    very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of
    very liberal conceit.
  H
am. What call you the carriages?
  Hor. [aside to Hamlet] I knew you must be edified by the
margen
t
    ere you had done.
  Osr. The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
  Ham. The phrase would be mo
re germane to the matter if we could
    carry cannon by our sides. I would it might be hangers til
l
then.
    But on! Six Barbary horses against six French swords, their
    assigns, and three li
beral-conceited carriages: that's the
French
    bet against the Danish. Why is this all impon'd, 
as you call
it?
  Osr. The King, sir, hath laid that, in a dozen passes between
    yourself and 
him, he shall not exceed you three hits; he hath
    laid on twelve for nine, and it would come to 
immediate trial
    if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.
  Ham. How if I answer no?
  Osr
. I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
  Ham. Sir, I will walk here in the hall
. If it please his
Majesty,
    it is the breathing time of day with me. Let the foils be
    bro
ught, the gentleman willing, and the King hold his
purpose,
    I will win for him if I can; if no
t, I will gain nothing but
my
    shame and the odd hits.
  Osr. Shall I redeliver you e'en so?

  Ham. To this effect, sir, after what flourish your nature will.
  Osr. I commend my duty to your 
lordship.
  Ham. Yours, yours. [Exit Osric.] He does well to commend it
    himself; there are no 
tongues else for's turn.
  Hor. This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.
  Ham. He did c
omply with his dug before he suck'd it. Thus has
he,
    and many more of the same bevy that I kno
w the drossy age
dotes
    on, only got the tune of the time and outward habit of
encounter-
   
 a kind of yesty collection, which carries them through and
    through the most fann'd and winnowe
d opinions; and do but
blow
    them to their trial-the bubbles are out,

                      
      Enter a Lord.

  Lord. My lord, his Majesty commended him to you by young Osric,
who
    b
rings back to him, that you attend him in the hall. He sends
to
    know if your pleasure hold to 
play with Laertes, or that you
will
    take longer time.
  Ham. I am constant to my purposes; th
ey follow the King's
pleasure.
    If his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or whensoever,
provi
ded
    I be so able as now.
  Lord. The King and Queen and all are coming down.
  Ham. In happy 
time.
  Lord. The Queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to
    Laertes before you fal
l to play.
  Ham. She well instructs me.
                                                    [Exit
 Lord.]
  Hor. You will lose this wager, my lord.
  Ham. I do not think so. Since he went into Fra
nce I have been
in
    continual practice. I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst
not
    thi
nk how ill all's here about my heart. But it is no matter.
  Hor. Nay, good my lord -
  Ham. It is
 but foolery; but it is such a kind of gaingiving as
    would perhaps trouble a woman.
  Hor. If 
your mind dislike anything, obey it. I will forestall
their
    repair hither and say you are not 
fit.
  Ham. Not a whit, we defy augury; there's a special providence
in
    the fall of a sparrow
. If it be now, 'tis not to come; if it
be
    not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet 
it will
come:
    the readiness is all. Since no man knows aught of what he
leaves,
    what is'
t to leave betimes? Let be.

    Enter King, Queen, Laertes, Osric, and Lords, with other
       
       Attendants with foils and gauntlets.
               A table and flagons of wine on it.

  
King. Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
                    [The King puts Laertes' h
and into Hamlet's.]
  Ham. Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong;
    But pardon't, as y
ou are a gentleman.
    This presence knows,
    And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd

    With sore distraction. What I have done
    That might your nature, honour, and exception
   
 Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
    Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet.
    I
f Hamlet from himself be taken away,
    And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
    Then Ha
mlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
    Who does it, then? His madness. If't be so,
    Hamlet is 
of the faction that is wrong'd;
    His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
    Sir, in this audience,

    Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd evil
    Free me so far in your most generous thoughts
  
  That I have shot my arrow o'er the house
    And hurt my brother.
  Laer. I am satisfied in natu
re,
    Whose motive in this case should stir me most
    To my revenge. But in my terms of honour

    I stand aloof, and will no reconcilement
    Till by some elder masters of known honour
    
I have a voice and precedent of peace
    To keep my name ungor'd. But till that time
    I do rec
eive your offer'd love like love,
    And will not wrong it.
  Ham. I embrace it freely,
    And 
will this brother's wager frankly play.
    Give us the foils. Come on.
  Laer. Come, one for me.

  Ham. I'll be your foil, Laertes. In mine ignorance
    Your skill shall, like a star i' th' dark
est night,
    Stick fiery off indeed.
  Laer. You mock me, sir.
  Ham. No, by this hand.
  King
. Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
    You know the wager?
  Ham. Very well, my lo
rd.
    Your Grace has laid the odds o' th' weaker side.
  King. I do not fear it, I have seen you
 both;
    But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.
  Laer. This is too heavy; let me see
 another.
  Ham. This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
                              
                  Prepare to play.
  Osr. Ay, my good lord.
  King. Set me the stoups of wine upon
 that table.
    If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
    Or quit in answer of the third exchan
ge,
    Let all the battlements their ordnance fire;
    The King shall drink to Hamlet's better b
reath,
    And in the cup an union shall he throw
    Richer than that which four successive kings

    In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;
    And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,

    The trumpet to the cannoneer without,
    The cannons to the heavens, the heaven to earth,
  
  'Now the King drinks to Hamlet.' Come, begin.
    And you the judges, bear a wary eye.
  Ham. Co
me on, sir.
  Laer. Come, my lord.                                They play.
  Ham. One.
  Laer. 
No.
  Ham. Judgment!
  Osr. A hit, a very palpable hit.
  Laer. Well, again!
  King. Stay, give 
me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
    Here's to thy health.
               [Drum; trumpets so
und; a piece goes off [within].
    Give him the cup.
  Ham. I'll play this bout first; set it by 
awhile.
    Come. (They play.) Another hit. What say you?
  Laer. A touch, a touch; I do confess't
.
  King. Our son shall win.
  Queen. He's fat, and scant of breath.
    Here, Hamlet, take my na
pkin, rub thy brows.
    The Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
  Ham. Good madam!
  King. Ge
rtrude, do not drink.
  Queen. I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.          Drinks.
  King. [as
ide] It is the poison'd cup; it is too late.
  Ham. I dare not drink yet, madam; by-and-by.
  Quee
n. Come, let me wipe thy face.
  Laer. My lord, I'll hit him now.
  King. I do not think't.
  Lae
r. [aside] And yet it is almost against my conscience.
  Ham. Come for the third, Laertes! You but 
dally.
    Pray you pass with your best violence;
    I am afeard you make a wanton of me.
  Laer
. Say you so? Come on.                               Play.
  Osr. Nothing neither way.
  Laer. Hav
e at you now!
                [Laertes wounds Hamlet; then] in scuffling, they
                   
 change rapiers, [and Hamlet wounds Laertes].
  King. Part them! They are incens'd.
  Ham. Nay com
e! again!                         The Queen falls.

  Osr. Look to the Queen there, ho!
  Hor. Th
ey bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?
  Osr. How is't, Laertes?
  Laer. Why, as a woodcock t
o mine own springe, Osric.
    I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.
  Ham. How does the Que
en?
  King. She sounds to see them bleed.
  Queen. No, no! the drink, the drink! O my dear Hamlet!

    The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.                 [Dies.]
  Ham. O villany! Ho! let the do
or be lock'd.
    Treachery! Seek it out.
                                                [Laertes
 falls.]
  Laer. It is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain;
    No medicine in the world can do t
hee good.
    In thee there is not half an hour of life.
    The treacherous instrument is in thy 
hand,
    Unbated and envenom'd. The foul practice
    Hath turn'd itself on me. Lo, here I lie,

    Never to rise again. Thy mother's poison'd.
    I can no more. The King, the King's to blame.

  Ham. The point envenom'd too?
    Then, venom, to thy work.                    Hurts the King.
 
 All. Treason! treason!
  King. O, yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt.
  Ham. Here, thou incest
uous, murd'rous, damned Dane,
    Drink off this potion! Is thy union here?
    Follow my mother. 
                                King dies.
  Laer. He is justly serv'd.
    It is a poison temper'
d by himself.
    Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet.
    Mine and my father's death come 
not upon thee,
    Nor thine on me!                                       Dies.
  Ham. Heaven make
 thee free of it! I follow thee.
    I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!
    You that look 
pale and tremble at this chance,
    That are but mutes or audience to this act,
    Had I but tim
e (as this fell sergeant, Death,
    Is strict in his arrest) O, I could tell you-
    But let it 
be. Horatio, I am dead;
    Thou liv'st; report me and my cause aright
    To the unsatisfied.
  
Hor. Never believe it.
    I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.
    Here's yet some liquor left
.
  Ham. As th'art a man,
    Give me the cup. Let go! By heaven, I'll ha't.
    O good Horatio, 
what a wounded name
    (Things standing thus unknown) shall live behind me!
    If thou didst eve
r hold me in thy heart,
    Absent thee from felicity awhile,
    And in this harsh world draw thy
 breath in pain,
    To tell my story.         [March afar off, and shot within.]
    What warlike
 noise is this?
  Osr. Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
    To the ambassadors of
 England gives
    This warlike volley.
  Ham. O, I die, Horatio!
    The potent poison quite o'e
rcrows my spirit.
    I cannot live to hear the news from England,
    But I do prophesy th' elect
ion lights
    On Fortinbras. He has my dying voice.
    So tell him, with th' occurrents, more an
d less,
    Which have solicited- the rest is silence.             Dies.
  Hor. Now cracks a noble
 heart. Good night, sweet prince,
    And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
               
                                  [March within.]
    Why does the drum come hither?

    Enter F
ortinbras and English Ambassadors, with Drum,
                  Colours, and Attendants.

  Fort.
 Where is this sight?
  Hor. What is it you will see?
    If aught of woe or wonder, cease your se
arch.
  Fort. This quarry cries on havoc. O proud Death,
    What feast is toward in thine eternal
 cell
    That thou so many princes at a shot
    So bloodily hast struck.
  Ambassador. The sigh
t is dismal;
    And our affairs from England come too late.
    The ears are senseless that shoul
d give us hearing
    To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd
    That Rosencrantz and Guildenste
rn are dead.
    Where should we have our thanks?
  Hor. Not from his mouth,
    Had it th' abili
ty of life to thank you.
    He never gave commandment for their death.
    But since, so jump upo
n this bloody question,
    You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
    Are here arriv'd, 
give order that these bodies
    High on a stage be placed to the view;
    And let me speak to th
e yet unknowing world
    How these things came about. So shall you hear
    Of carnal, bloody and
 unnatural acts;
    Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters;
    Of deaths put on by cunning a
nd forc'd cause;
    And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
    Fall'n on th' inventors' heads. All
 this can I
    Truly deliver.
  Fort. Let us haste to hear it,
    And call the noblest to the a
udience.
    For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.
    I have some rights of memory in this ki
ngdom
    Which now, to claim my vantage doth invite me.
  Hor. Of that I shall have also cause to
 speak,
    And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more.
    But let this same be presently p
erform'd,
    Even while men's minds are wild, lest more mischance
    On plots and errors happen.

  Fort. Let four captains
    Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage;
    For he was likely, ha
d he been put on,
    To have prov'd most royally; and for his passage
    The soldiers' music and
 the rites of war
    Speak loudly for him.
    Take up the bodies. Such a sight as this
    Beco
mes the field but here shows much amiss.
    Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
            Exeunt marchi
ng; after the which a peal of ordnance
                                                   are shot 
off.

ACT I. Scene I.
Elsinore. A platform 
before the Castle.

Enter two Sentinels-[first,] Francisco, [who paces up and down
at his post; t
hen] Bernardo, [who approaches him].

  Ber. Who's there?
  Fran. Nay, answer me. Stand and unfol
d yourself.
  Ber. Long live the King!
  Fran. Bernardo?
  Ber. He.
  Fran. You come most carefu
lly upon your hour.
  Ber. 'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.
  Fran. For this re
lief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold,
    And I am sick at heart.
  Ber. Have you had quiet guard?

  Fran. Not a mouse stirring.
  Ber. Well, good night.
    If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,

    The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.

                    Enter Horatio and Marcellus.


  Fran. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?
  Hor. Friends to this ground.
  Mar. An
d liegemen to the Dane.
  Fran. Give you good night.
  Mar. O, farewell, honest soldier.
    Who 
hath reliev'd you?
  Fran. Bernardo hath my place.
    Give you good night.                       
            Exit.
  Mar. Holla, Bernardo!
  Ber. Say-
    What, is Horatio there ?
  Hor. A piec
e of him.
  Ber. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.
  Mar. What, has this thing appear'd a
gain to-night?
  Ber. I have seen nothing.
  Mar. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
    And will
 not let belief take hold of him
    Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.
    Therefore 
I have entreated him along,
    With us to watch the minutes of this night,
    That, if again thi
s apparition come,
    He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
  Hor. Tush, tush, 'twill not appe
ar.
  Ber. Sit down awhile,
    And let us once again assail your ears,
    That are so fortified
 against our story,
    What we two nights have seen.
  Hor. Well, sit we down,
    And let us he
ar Bernardo speak of this.
  Ber. Last night of all,
    When yond same star that's westward from 
the pole
    Had made his course t' illume that part of heaven
    Where now it burns, Marcellus a
nd myself,
    The bell then beating one-

                        Enter Ghost.

  Mar. Peace! 
break thee off! Look where it comes again!
  Ber. In the same figure, like the King that's dead.
 
 Mar. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
  Ber. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio
.
  Hor. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.
  Ber. It would be spoke to.
  Mar. Quest
ion it, Horatio.
  Hor. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night
    Together with that fair
 and warlike form
    In which the majesty of buried Denmark
    Did sometimes march? By heaven I 
charge thee speak!
  Mar. It is offended.
  Ber. See, it stalks away!
  Hor. Stay! Speak, speak! 
I charge thee speak!
                                                     Exit Ghost.
  Mar. 'Tis 
gone and will not answer.
  Ber. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale.
    Is not this some
thing more than fantasy?
    What think you on't?
  Hor. Before my God, I might not this believe

    Without the sensible and true avouch
    Of mine own eyes.
  Mar. Is it not like the King?
  
Hor. As thou art to thyself.
    Such was the very armour he had on
    When he th' ambitious Norw
ay combated.
    So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,
    He smote the sledded Polacks on t
he ice.
    'Tis strange.
  Mar. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
    With martial 
stalk hath he gone by our watch.
  Hor. In what particular thought to work I know not;
    But, in
 the gross and scope of my opinion,
    This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
  Mar. Good
 now, sit down, and tell me he that knows,
    Why this same strict and most observant watch
    S
o nightly toils the subject of the land,
    And why such daily cast of brazen cannon
    And fore
ign mart for implements of war;
    Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
    Does not 
divide the Sunday from the week.
    What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
    Doth make th
e night joint-labourer with the day?
    Who is't that can inform me?
  Hor. That can I.
    At l
east, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
    Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
    Was, as
 you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
    Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
    Dar'd to t
he combat; in which our valiant Hamlet
    (For so this side of our known world esteem'd him)
    
Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,
    Well ratified by law and heraldry,
    Did
 forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
    Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror;
    A
gainst the which a moiety competent
    Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
    To the inher
itance of Fortinbras,
    Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant
    And carriage of the
 article design'd,
    His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
    Of unimproved mettle ho
t and full,
    Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,
    Shark'd up a list of lawless res
olutes,
    For food and diet, to some enterprise
    That hath a stomach in't; which is no other,

    As it doth well appear unto our state,
    But to recover of us, by strong hand
    And term
s compulsatory, those foresaid lands
    So by his father lost; and this, I take it,
    Is the ma
in motive of our preparations,
    The source of this our watch, and the chief head
    Of this po
st-haste and romage in the land.
  Ber. I think it be no other but e'en so.
    Well may it sort t
hat this portentous figure
    Comes armed through our watch, so like the King
    That was and is
 the question of these wars.
  Hor. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
    In the most high a
nd palmy state of Rome,
    A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
    The graves stood tenantles
s, and the sheeted dead
    Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;
    As stars with trains o
f fire, and dews of blood,
    Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
    Upon whose influence N
eptune's empire stands
    Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.
    And even the like precurs
e of fierce events,
    As harbingers preceding still the fates
    And prologue to the omen comin
g on,
    Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
    Unto our climature and countrymen.

  
                    Enter Ghost again.

    But soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again!
    I'll 
cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!
                                               Spread
s his arms.
    If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
    Speak to me.
    If there be any goo
d thing to be done,
    That may to thee do ease, and, race to me,
    Speak to me.
    If thou a
rt privy to thy country's fate,
    Which happily foreknowing may avoid,
    O, speak!
    Or if 
thou hast uphoarded in thy life
    Extorted treasure in the womb of earth
    (For which, they sa
y, you spirits oft walk in death),
                                                 The cock crows.

    Speak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!
  Mar. Shall I strike at it with my partis
an?
  Hor. Do, if it will not stand.
  Ber. 'Tis here!
  Hor. 'Tis here!
  Mar. 'Tis gone!
    
                                                 Exit Ghost.
    We do it wrong, being so majestica
l,
    To offer it the show of violence;
    For it is as the air, invulnerable,
    And our vain
 blows malicious mockery.
  Ber. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
  Hor. And then it sta
rted, like a guilty thing
    Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
    The cock, that is the trump
et to the morn,
    Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
    Awake the god of day; and a
t his warning,
    Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
    Th' extravagant and erring spirit 
hies
    To his confine; and of the truth herein
    This present object made probation.
  Mar. I
t faded on the crowing of the cock.
    Some say that ever, 'gainst that season comes
    Wherein 
our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
    The bird of dawning singeth all night long;
    And then, t
hey say, no spirit dare stir abroad,
    The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,
    No 
fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
    So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
  Hor. So
 have I heard and do in part believe it.
    But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
    Walks 
o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.
    Break we our watch up; and by my advice
    Let us imp
art what we have seen to-night
    Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
    This spirit, dumb to 
us, will speak to him.
    Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
    As needful in our lov
es, fitting our duty?
    Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
    Where we shall find him 
most conveniently.           Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A room of state in the Castle.


Flourish. [Enter Claudius, King of Denmark, Gertrude the Queen,
Hamlet,
Polonius, Laertes and his
 sister Ophelia, [Voltemand, Cornelius,]
Lords Attendant.

  King. Though yet of Hamlet our dear 
brother's death
    The memory be green, and that it us befitted
    To bear our hearts in grief, 
and our whole kingdom
    To be contracted in one brow of woe,
    Yet so far hath discretion foug
ht with nature
    That we with wisest sorrow think on him
    Together with remembrance of oursel
ves.
    Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
    Th' imperial jointress to this warlike 
state,
    Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,
    With an auspicious, and a dropping eye,
  
  With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,
    In equal scale weighing delight and dole,

    Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd
    Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
    
With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
    Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
   
 Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
    Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
    Our st
ate to be disjoint and out of frame,
    Colleagued with this dream of his advantage,
    He hath 
not fail'd to pester us with message
    Importing the surrender of those lands
    Lost by his fa
ther, with all bands of law,
    To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
    Now for ourself
 and for this time of meeting.
    Thus much the business is: we have here writ
    To Norway, unc
le of young Fortinbras,
    Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears
    Of this his nephew's purp
ose, to suppress
    His further gait herein, in that the levies,
    The lists, and full proporti
ons are all made
    Out of his subject; and we here dispatch
    You, good Cornelius, and you, Vo
ltemand,
    For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,
    Giving to you no further personal pow
er
    To business with the King, more than the scope
    Of these dilated articles allow.        
    [Gives a paper.]
    Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
  Cor., Volt. In that, an
d all things, will we show our duty.
  King. We doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell.
             
                    Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius.
    And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?

    You told us of some suit. What is't, Laertes?
    You cannot speak of reason to the Dane
   
 And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
    That shall not be my offer, not thy askin
g?
    The head is not more native to the heart,
    The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
   
 Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
    What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
  Laer. My drea
d lord,
    Your leave and favour to return to France;
    From whence though willingly I came to 
Denmark
    To show my duty in your coronation,
    Yet now I must confess, that duty done,
    M
y thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
    And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.

  King. Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
  Pol. He hath, my lord, wrung from me m
y slow leave
    By laboursome petition, and at last
    Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent.

    I do beseech you give him leave to go.
  King. Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,
   
 And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
    But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son-
  Ham. [asid
e] A little more than kin, and less than kind!
  King. How is it that the clouds still hang on you?

  Ham. Not so, my lord. I am too much i' th' sun.
  Queen. Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour o
ff,
    And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
    Do not for ever with thy vailed lids

    Seek for thy noble father in the dust.
    Thou know'st 'tis common. All that lives must die,

    Passing through nature to eternity.
  Ham. Ay, madam, it is common.
  Queen. If it be,
    W
hy seems it so particular with thee?
  Ham. Seems, madam, Nay, it is. I know not 'seems.'
    'Tis
 not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
    Nor customary suits of solemn black,
    Nor windy susp
iration of forc'd breath,
    No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
    Nor the dejected havior o
f the visage,
    Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
    'That can denote me truly. 
These indeed seem,
    For they are actions that a man might play;
    But I have that within whic
h passeth show-
    These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
  King. 'Tis sweet and commendab
le in your nature, Hamlet,
    To give these mourning duties to your father;
    But you must know
, your father lost a father;
    That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
    In filial 
obligation for some term
    To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever
    In obstinate condolement
 is a course
    Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief;
    It shows a will most incorrect t
o heaven,
    A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
    An understanding simple and unschool'd;

    For what we know must be, and is as common
    As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
    Why 
should we in our peevish opposition
    Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
    A fault
 against the dead, a fault to nature,
    To reason most absurd, whose common theme
    Is death o
f fathers, and who still hath cried,
    From the first corse till he that died to-day,
    'This 
must be so.' We pray you throw to earth
    This unprevailing woe, and think of us
    As of a fat
her; for let the world take note
    You are the most immediate to our throne,
    And with no les
s nobility of love
    Than that which dearest father bears his son
    Do I impart toward you. Fo
r your intent
    In going back to school in Wittenberg,
    It is most retrograde to our desire;

    And we beseech you, bend you to remain
    Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
    Our 
chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
  Queen. Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.
    
I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.
  Ham. I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
  K
ing. Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.
    Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come.
    This gent
le and unforc'd accord of Hamlet
    Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,
    No jocund hea
lth that Denmark drinks to-day
    But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
    And the King
's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,
    Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.
                
                Flourish. Exeunt all but Hamlet.
  Ham. O that this too too solid flesh would melt,

    Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!
    Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
    His canon
 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
    How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
    Seem to me a
ll the uses of this world!
    Fie on't! ah, fie! 'Tis an unweeded garden
    That grows to seed; 
things rank and gross in nature
    Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
    But two mo
nths dead! Nay, not so much, not two.
    So excellent a king, that was to this
    Hyperion to a 
satyr; so loving to my mother
    That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
    Visit her face 
too roughly. Heaven and earth!
    Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him
    As if increase 
of appetite had grown
    By what it fed on; and yet, within a month-
    Let me not think on't! F
railty, thy name is woman!-
    A little month, or ere those shoes were old
    With which she fol
lowed my poor father's body
    Like Niobe, all tears- why she, even she
    (O God! a beast that 
wants discourse of reason
    Would have mourn'd longer) married with my uncle;
    My father's br
other, but no more like my father
    Than I to Hercules. Within a month,
    Ere yet the salt of 
most unrighteous tears
    Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
    She married. O, most wick
ed speed, to post
    With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
    It is not, nor it cannot come 
to good.
    But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue!

          Enter Horatio, Marcellus, 
and Bernardo.

  Hor. Hail to your lordship!
  Ham. I am glad to see you well.
    Horatio!- or 
I do forget myself.
  Hor. The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
  Ham. Sir, my good frie
nd- I'll change that name with you.
    And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?
    Marcellus?

  Mar. My good lord!
  Ham. I am very glad to see you.- [To Bernardo] Good even, sir.-

    But
 what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
  Hor. A truant disposition, good my lord.
  Ham. I wou
ld not hear your enemy say so,
    Nor shall you do my ear that violence
    To make it truster of
 your own report
    Against yourself. I know you are no truant.
    But what is your affair in El
sinore?
    We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
  Hor. My lord, I came to see your fathe
r's funeral.
  Ham. I prithee do not mock me, fellow student.
    I think it was to see my mother'
s wedding.
  Hor. Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.
  Ham. Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The fune
ral bak'd meats
    Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
    Would I had met my dearest f
oe in heaven
    Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
    My father- methinks I see my father.
 
 Hor. O, where, my lord?
  Ham. In my mind's eye, Horatio.
  Hor. I saw him once. He was a goodly 
king.
  Ham. He was a man, take him for all in all.
    I shall not look upon his like again.
  H
or. My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
  Ham. Saw? who?
  Hor. My lord, the King your father.

  Ham. The King my father?
  Hor. Season your admiration for a while
    With an attent ear, til
l I may deliver
    Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
    This marvel to you.
  Ham. For God's
 love let me hear!
  Hor. Two nights together had these gentlemen
    (Marcellus and Bernardo) on 
their watch
    In the dead vast and middle of the night
    Been thus encount'red. A figure like 
your father,
    Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
    Appears before them and with solemn march

    Goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walk'd
    By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,

    Within his truncheon's length; whilst they distill'd
    Almost to jelly with the act of fear
,
    Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
    In dreadful secrecy impart they did,
    An
d I with them the third night kept the watch;
    Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
    
Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
    The apparition comes. I knew your father.
   
 These hands are not more like.
  Ham. But where was this?
  Mar. My lord, upon the platform where
 we watch'd.
  Ham. Did you not speak to it?
  Hor. My lord, I did;
    But answer made it none. 
Yet once methought
    It lifted up it head and did address
    Itself to motion, like as it would
 speak;
    But even then the morning cock crew loud,
    And at the sound it shrunk in haste away

    And vanish'd from our sight.
  Ham. 'Tis very strange.
  Hor. As I do live, my honour'd lord
, 'tis true;
    And we did think it writ down in our duty
    To let you know of it.
  Ham. Inde
ed, indeed, sirs. But this troubles me.
    Hold you the watch to-night?
  Both [Mar. and Ber.] We
 do, my lord.
  Ham. Arm'd, say you?
  Both. Arm'd, my lord.
  Ham. From top to toe?
  Both. My 
lord, from head to foot.
  Ham. Then saw you not his face?
  Hor. O, yes, my lord! He wore his bea
ver up.
  Ham. What, look'd he frowningly.
  Hor. A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
  H
am. Pale or red?
  Hor. Nay, very pale.
  Ham. And fix'd his eyes upon you?
  Hor. Most constantl
y.
  Ham. I would I had been there.
  Hor. It would have much amaz'd you.
  Ham. Very like, very 
like. Stay'd it long?
  Hor. While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
  Both. Longer, l
onger.
  Hor. Not when I saw't.
  Ham. His beard was grizzled- no?
  Hor. It was, as I have seen 
it in his life,
    A sable silver'd.
  Ham. I will watch to-night.
    Perchance 'twill walk aga
in.
  Hor. I warr'nt it will.
  Ham. If it assume my noble father's person,
    I'll speak to it,
 though hell itself should gape
    And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
    If you have hith
erto conceal'd this sight,
    Let it be tenable in your silence still;
    And whatsoever else sh
all hap to-night,
    Give it an understanding but no tongue.
    I will requite your loves. So, f
are you well.
    Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
    I'll visit you.
  All. Our dut
y to your honour.
  Ham. Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell.
                                   
     Exeunt [all but Hamlet].
    My father's spirit- in arms? All is not well.
    I doubt some f
oul play. Would the night were come!
    Till then sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,
    T
hough all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
Exit.




Scene III.
Elsinore. A room in t
he house of Polonius.

Enter Laertes and Ophelia.

  Laer. My necessaries are embark'd. Farewell
.
    And, sister, as the winds give benefit
    And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
    But l
et me hear from you.
  Oph. Do you doubt that?
  Laer. For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,

    Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood;
    A violet in the youth of primy nature,
    Forwar
d, not permanent- sweet, not lasting;
    The perfume and suppliance of a minute;
    No more.
  
Oph. No more but so?
  Laer. Think it no more.
    For nature crescent does not grow alone
    In
 thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,
    The inward service of the mind and soul
    Grows w
ide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
    And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
    The virtue 
of his will; but you must fear,
    His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
    For he him
self is subject to his birth.
    He may not, as unvalued persons do,
    Carve for himself, for o
n his choice depends
    The safety and health of this whole state,
    And therefore must his cho
ice be circumscrib'd
    Unto the voice and yielding of that body
    Whereof he is the head. Then
 if he says he loves you,
    It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
    As he in his particular
 act and place
    May give his saying deed; which is no further
    Than the main voice of Denmar
k goes withal.
    Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain
    If with too credent ear you li
st his songs,
    Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
    To his unmast'red importuni
ty.
    Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
    And keep you in the rear of your affection,

    Out of the shot and danger of desire.
    The chariest maid is prodigal enough
    If she un
mask her beauty to the moon.
    Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes.
    The canker galls
 the infants of the spring
    Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd,
    And in the morn and 
liquid dew of youth
    Contagious blastments are most imminent.
    Be wary then; best safety lie
s in fear.
    Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
  Oph. I shall th' effect of this go
od lesson keep
    As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
    Do not as some ungracious pa
stors do,
    Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven,
    Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless l
ibertine,
    Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads
    And recks not his own rede.
  Lae
r. O, fear me not!

                       Enter Polonius.

    I stay too long. But here my fat
her comes.
    A double blessing is a double grace;
    Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
  Po
l. Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame!
    The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
 
   And you are stay'd for. There- my blessing with thee!
    And these few precepts in thy memory

    Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
    Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.

    Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar:
    Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried
,
    Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel;
    But do not dull thy palm with entertainm
ent
    Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware
    Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,

    Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee.
    Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice;

    Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
    Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,

    But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
    For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
    A
nd they in France of the best rank and station
    Are most select and generous, chief in that.
  
  Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
    For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
    And borro
wing dulls the edge of husbandry.
    This above all- to thine own self be true,
    And it must f
ollow, as the night the day,
    Thou canst not then be false to any man.
    Farewell. My blessin
g season this in thee!
  Laer. Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
  Pol. The time invites yo
u. Go, your servants tend.
  Laer. Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well
    What I have said to yo
u.
  Oph. 'Tis in my memory lock'd,
    And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
  Laer. Farewe
ll.                                          Exit.
  Pol. What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?

  Oph. So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
  Pol. Marry, well bethought!
    'Tis 
told me he hath very oft of late
    Given private time to you, and you yourself
    Have of your 
audience been most free and bounteous.
    If it be so- as so 'tis put on me,
    And that in way 
of caution- I must tell you
    You do not understand yourself so clearly
    As it behooves my da
ughter and your honour.
    What is between you? Give me up the truth.
  Oph. He hath, my lord, of
 late made many tenders
    Of his affection to me.
  Pol. Affection? Pooh! You speak like a green
 girl,
    Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
    Do you believe his tenders, as you call the
m?
  Oph. I do not know, my lord, what I should think,
  Pol. Marry, I will teach you! Think yours
elf a baby
    That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
    Which are not sterling. Tender 
yourself more dearly,
    Or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
    Running it thus) you'l
l tender me a fool.
  Oph. My lord, he hath importun'd me with love
    In honourable fashion.
  
Pol. Ay, fashion you may call it. Go to, go to!
  Oph. And hath given countenance to his speech, my
 lord,
    With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
  Pol. Ay, springes to catch woodcocks! I do k
now,
    When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
    Lends the tongue vows. These blazes, daug
hter,
    Giving more light than heat, extinct in both
    Even in their promise, as it is a-makin
g,
    You must not take for fire. From this time
    Be something scanter of your maiden presence
.
    Set your entreatments at a higher rate
    Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
    B
elieve so much in him, that he is young,
    And with a larger tether may he walk
    Than may be 
given you. In few, Ophelia,
    Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
    Not of that dye
 which their investments show,
    But mere implorators of unholy suits,
    Breathing like sancti
fied and pious bawds,
    The better to beguile. This is for all:
    I would not, in plain terms,
 from this time forth
    Have you so slander any moment leisure
    As to give words or talk with
 the Lord Hamlet.
    Look to't, I charge you. Come your ways.
  Oph. I shall obey, my lord.
    
                                                     Exeunt.




Scene IV.
Elsinore. The platf
orm before the Castle.

Enter Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus.

  Ham. The air bites shrewdly; it
 is very cold.
  Hor. It is a nipping and an eager air.
  Ham. What hour now?
  Hor. I think it l
acks of twelve.
  Mar. No, it is struck.
  Hor. Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws near the sea
son
    Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
                   A flourish of trumpets, and t
wo pieces go off.
    What does this mean, my lord?
  Ham. The King doth wake to-night and takes h
is rouse,
    Keeps wassail, and the swagg'ring upspring reels,
    And, as he drains his draughts
 of Rhenish down,
    The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out
    The triumph of his pledge.
  H
or. Is it a custom?
  Ham. Ay, marry, is't;
    But to my mind, though I am native here
    And t
o the manner born, it is a custom
    More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
    This he
avy-headed revel east and west
    Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations;
    They clip us 
drunkards and with swinish phrase
    Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
    From our achievem
ents, though perform'd at height,
    The pith and marrow of our attribute.
    So oft it chances 
in particular men
    That, for some vicious mole of nature in them,
    As in their birth,- where
in they are not guilty,
    Since nature cannot choose his origin,-
    By the o'ergrowth of some 
complexion,
    Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
    Or by some habit that too muc
h o'erleavens
    The form of plausive manners, that these men
    Carrying, I say, the stamp of o
ne defect,
    Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,
    Their virtues else- be they as pure a
s grace,
    As infinite as man may undergo-
    Shall in the general censure take corruption
   
 From that particular fault. The dram of e'il
    Doth all the noble substance often dout To his ow
n scandal.

                         Enter Ghost.

  Hor. Look, my lord, it comes!
  Ham. Angel
s and ministers of grace defend us!
    Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
    Bring wit
h thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
    Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
    Thou com
'st in such a questionable shape
    That I will speak to thee. I'll call thee Hamlet,
    King, f
ather, royal Dane. O, answer me?
    Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell
    Why thy canoniz'd
 bones, hearsed in death,
    Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre
    Wherein we saw the
e quietly inurn'd,
    Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws
    To cast thee up again. What may
 this mean
    That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,
    Revisits thus the glimpses of t
he moon,
    Making night hideous, and we fools of nature
    So horridly to shake our disposition

    With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
    Say, why is this? wherefore? What should w
e do?
                                           Ghost beckons Hamlet.
  Hor. It beckons you to go
 away with it,
    As if it some impartment did desire
    To you alone.
  Mar. Look with what co
urteous action
    It waves you to a more removed ground.
    But do not go with it!
  Hor. No, b
y no means!
  Ham. It will not speak. Then will I follow it.
  Hor. Do not, my lord!
  Ham. Why, 
what should be the fear?
    I do not set my life at a pin's fee;
    And for my soul, what can it
 do to that,
    Being a thing immortal as itself?
    It waves me forth again. I'll follow it.
 
 Hor. What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
    Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
 
   That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
    And there assume some other, horrible form
    Whi
ch might deprive your sovereignty of reason
    And draw you into madness? Think of it.
    The ve
ry place puts toys of desperation,
    Without more motive, into every brain
    That looks so man
y fadoms to the sea
    And hears it roar beneath.
  Ham. It waves me still.
    Go on. I'll foll
ow thee.
  Mar. You shall not go, my lord.
  Ham. Hold off your hands!
  Hor. Be rul'd. You shall
 not go.
  Ham. My fate cries out
    And makes each petty artire in this body
    As hardy as th
e Nemean lion's nerve.
                                                [Ghost beckons.]

    Stil
l am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
    By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!-
    I 
say, away!- Go on. I'll follow thee.
                                        Exeunt Ghost and Hamle
t.
  Hor. He waxes desperate with imagination.
  Mar. Let's follow. 'Tis not fit thus to obey him.

  Hor. Have after. To what issue will this come?
  Mar. Something is rotten in the state of Denma
rk.
  Hor. Heaven will direct it.
  Mar. Nay, let's follow him.
                                 
                        Exeunt.




Scene V.
Elsinore. The Castle. Another part of the fortifi
cations.

Enter Ghost and Hamlet.

  Ham. Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak! I'll go no further.

  Ghost. Mark me.
  Ham. I will.
  Ghost. My hour is almost come,
    When I to sulph'rous and t
ormenting flames
    Must render up myself.
  Ham. Alas, poor ghost!
  Ghost. Pity me not, but le
nd thy serious hearing
    To what I shall unfold.
  Ham. Speak. I am bound to hear.
  Ghost. So 
art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
  Ham. What?
  Ghost. I am thy father's spirit,
    Do
om'd for a certain term to walk the night,
    And for the day confin'd to fast in fires,
    Till
 the foul crimes done in my days of nature
    Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid
   
 To tell the secrets of my prison house,
    I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
    Would h
arrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
    Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their sphe
res,
    Thy knotted and combined locks to part,
    And each particular hair to stand on end
   
 Like quills upon the fretful porcupine.
    But this eternal blazon must not be
    To ears of fl
esh and blood. List, list, O, list!
    If thou didst ever thy dear father love-
  Ham. O God!
  
Ghost. Revenge his foul and most unnatural murther.
  Ham. Murther?
  Ghost. Murther most foul, as
 in the best it is;
    But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.
  Ham. Haste me to know't, tha
t I, with wings as swift
    As meditation or the thoughts of love,
    May sweep to my revenge.

  Ghost. I find thee apt;
    And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
    That rots itself i
n ease on Lethe wharf,
    Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.
    'Tis given out th
at, sleeping in my orchard,
    A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark
    Is by a forged
 process of my death
    Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth,
    The serpent that did sting
 thy father's life
    Now wears his crown.
  Ham. O my prophetic soul!
    My uncle?
  Ghost. A
y, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
    With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts-

    O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
    So to seduce!- won to his shameful lust
    Th
e will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.
    O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there,
    From me,
 whose love was of that dignity
    That it went hand in hand even with the vow
    I made to her 
in marriage, and to decline
    Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
    To those of mine!

    But virtue, as it never will be mov'd,
    Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
   
 So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
    Will sate itself in a celestial bed
    And prey o
n garbage.
    But soft! methinks I scent the morning air.
    Brief let me be. Sleeping within my
 orchard,
    My custom always of the afternoon,
    Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
    Wit
h juice of cursed hebona in a vial,
    And in the porches of my ears did pour
    The leperous di
stilment; whose effect
    Holds such an enmity with blood of man
    That swift as quicksilver it
 courses through
    The natural gates and alleys of the body,
    And with a sudden vigour it dot
h posset
    And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
    The thin and wholesome blood. So did it
 mine;
    And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
    Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome cr
ust
    All my smooth body.
    Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
    Of life, of crown, 
of queen, at once dispatch'd;
    Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
    Unhous'led, disappoi
nted, unanel'd,
    No reckoning made, but sent to my account
    With all my imperfections on my 
head.
  Ham. O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
  Ghost. If thou hast nature in thee, bear i
t not.
    Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
    A couch for luxury and damned incest.
    But,
 howsoever thou pursuest this act,
    Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
    Against t
hy mother aught. Leave her to heaven,
    And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge
    To prick
 and sting her. Fare thee well at once.
    The glowworm shows the matin to be near
    And gins t
o pale his uneffectual fire.
    Adieu, adieu, adieu! Remember me.                      Exit.

  
Ham. O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?
    And shall I couple hell? Hold, hold, my hear
t!
    And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
    But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?
    A
y, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
    In this distracted globe. Remember thee?
    Yea
, from the table of my memory
    I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
    All saws of books, 
all forms, all pressures past
    That youth and observation copied there,
    And thy commandment
 all alone shall live
    Within the book and volume of my brain,
    Unmix'd with baser matter. Y
es, by heaven!
    O most pernicious woman!
    O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
    
My tables! Meet it is I set it down
    That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
    At le
ast I am sure it may be so in Denmark.        [Writes.]
    So, uncle, there you are. Now to my wor
d:
    It is 'Adieu, adieu! Remember me.'
    I have sworn't.
  Hor. (within) My lord, my lord!


                   Enter Horatio and Marcellus.

  Mar. Lord Hamlet!
  Hor. Heaven secure him!

  Ham. So be it!
  Mar. Illo, ho, ho, my lord!
  Ham. Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.
  Ma
r. How is't, my noble lord?
  Hor. What news, my lord?
  Mar. O, wonderful!
  Hor. Good my lord, 
tell it.
  Ham. No, you will reveal it.
  Hor. Not I, my lord, by heaven!
  Mar. Nor I, my lord.

  Ham. How say you then? Would heart of man once think it?
    But you'll be secret?
  Both. Ay, 
by heaven, my lord.
  Ham. There's neer a villain dwelling in all Denmark
    But he's an arrant k
nave.
  Hor. There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
    To tell us this.
  Ham. Why, 
right! You are in the right!
    And so, without more circumstance at all,
    I hold it fit that 
we shake hands and part;
    You, as your business and desires shall point you,
    For every man 
hath business and desire,
    Such as it is; and for my own poor part,
    Look you, I'll go pray.

  Hor. These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
  Ham. I am sorry they offend you, heartil
y;
    Yes, faith, heartily.
  Hor. There's no offence, my lord.
  Ham. Yes, by Saint Patrick, bu
t there is, Horatio,
    And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
    It is an honest ghos
t, that let me tell you.
    For your desire to know what is between us,
    O'ermaster't as you m
ay. And now, good friends,
    As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,
    Give me one poor re
quest.
  Hor. What is't, my lord? We will.
  Ham. Never make known what you have seen to-night.
 
 Both. My lord, we will not.
  Ham. Nay, but swear't.
  Hor. In faith,
    My lord, not I.
  Mar
. Nor I, my lord- in faith.
  Ham. Upon my sword.
  Mar. We have sworn, my lord, already.
  Ham. 
Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.

                 Ghost cries under the stage.

  Ghost. Swear.

  Ham. Aha boy, say'st thou so? Art thou there, truepenny?
    Come on! You hear this fellow in the
 cellarage.
    Consent to swear.
  Hor. Propose the oath, my lord.
  Ham. Never to speak of this
 that you have seen.
    Swear by my sword.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
  Ham. Hic et ubique? Then 
we'll shift our ground.
    Come hither, gentlemen,
    And lay your hands again upon my sword.
 
   Never to speak of this that you have heard:
    Swear by my sword.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear by 
his sword.
  Ham. Well said, old mole! Canst work i' th' earth so fast?
    A worthy pioner! Once 
more remove, good friends."
  Hor. O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
  Ham. And there
fore as a stranger give it welcome.
    There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
    Th
an are dreamt of in your philosophy.
    But come!
    Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,

    How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself
    (As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
    To
 put an antic disposition on),
    That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
    With arms e
ncumb'red thus, or this head-shake,
    Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
    As 'Well, w
ell, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'
    Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if the
y might,'
    Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
    That you know aught of me- this is not to 
do,
    So grace and mercy at your most need help you,
    Swear.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
    
                                               [They swear.]
  Ham. Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! S
o, gentlemen,
    With all my love I do commend me to you;
    And what so poor a man as Hamlet is

    May do t' express his love and friending to you,
    God willing, shall not lack. Let us go i
n together;
    And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
    The time is out of joint. O curse
d spite
    That ever I was born to set it right!
    Nay, come, let's go together.
             
                                            Exeunt.

Act II. Scene I.
Elsinore.
 A room in the house of Polonius.

Enter Polonius and Reynaldo.

  Pol. Give him this money and 
these notes, Reynaldo.
  Rey. I will, my lord.
  Pol. You shall do marvell's wisely, good Reynaldo
,
    Before You visit him, to make inquire
    Of his behaviour.
  Rey. My lord, I did intend it
.
  Pol. Marry, well said, very well said. Look you, sir,
    Enquire me first what Danskers are i
n Paris;
    And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
    What company, at what expense;
 and finding
    By this encompassment and drift of question
    That they do know my son, come yo
u more nearer
    Than your particular demands will touch it.
    Take you, as 'twere, some distan
t knowledge of him;
    As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
    And in part him.' Do you 
mark this, Reynaldo?
  Rey. Ay, very well, my lord.
  Pol. 'And in part him, but,' you may say, 'n
ot well.
    But if't be he I mean, he's very wild
    Addicted so and so'; and there put on him

    What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
    As may dishonour him- take heed of that;
  
  But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips
    As are companions noted and most known
    To y
outh and liberty.
  Rey. As gaming, my lord.
  Pol. Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrellin
g,
    Drabbing. You may go so far.
  Rey. My lord, that would dishonour him.
  Pol. Faith, no, a
s you may season it in the charge.
    You must not put another scandal on him,
    That he is ope
n to incontinency.
    That's not my meaning. But breathe his faults so quaintly
    That they may
 seem the taints of liberty,
    The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
    A savageness in unrec
laimed blood,
    Of general assault.
  Rey. But, my good lord-
  Pol. Wherefore should you do th
is?
  Rey. Ay, my lord,
    I would know that.
  Pol. Marry, sir, here's my drift,
    And I bel
ieve it is a fetch of warrant.
    You laying these slight sullies on my son
    As 'twere a thing
 a little soil'd i' th' working,
    Mark you,
    Your party in converse, him you would sound,
 
   Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
    The youth you breathe of guilty, be assur'd
    
He closes with you in this consequence:
    'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman'-
    Ac
cording to the phrase or the addition
    Of man and country-
  Rey. Very good, my lord.
  Pol. A
nd then, sir, does 'a this- 'a does- What was I about to
say?
    By the mass, I was about to say 
something! Where did I leave?
  Rey. At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,' and
    ge
ntleman.'
  Pol. At 'closes in the consequence'- Ay, marry!
    He closes thus: 'I know the gentle
man.
    I saw him yesterday, or t'other day,
    Or then, or then, with such or such; and, as you
 say,
    There was 'a gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
    There falling out at tennis'; or per
chance,
    'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'
    Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
    Se
e you now-
    Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth;
    And thus do we of wisdom and o
f reach,
    With windlasses and with assays of bias,
    By indirections find directions out.
  
  So, by my former lecture and advice,
    Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?
  Rey. My 
lord, I have.
  Pol. God b' wi' ye, fare ye well!
  Rey. Good my lord!                            
        [Going.]
  Pol. Observe his inclination in yourself.
  Rey. I shall, my lord.
  Pol. And 
let him ply his music.
  Rey. Well, my lord.
  Pol. Farewell!
                                   
               Exit Reynaldo.

                       Enter Ophelia.

    How now, Ophelia? What
's the matter?
  Oph. O my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
  Pol. With what, i' th' name
 of God?
  Oph. My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
    Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbra
c'd,
    No hat upon his head, his stockings foul'd,
    Ungart'red, and down-gyved to his ankle;

    Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,
    And with a look so piteous in purport
 
   As if he had been loosed out of hell
    To speak of horrors- he comes before me.
  Pol. Mad fo
r thy love?
  Oph. My lord, I do not know,
    But truly I do fear it.
  Pol. What said he?
  Op
h. He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
    Then goes he to the length of all his arm,
    An
d, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
    He falls to such perusal of my face
    As he would
 draw it. Long stay'd he so.
    At last, a little shaking of mine arm,
    And thrice his head th
us waving up and down,
    He rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound
    As it did seem to shatter 
all his bulk
    And end his being. That done, he lets me go,
    And with his head over his shoul
der turn'd
    He seem'd to find his way without his eyes,
    For out o' doors he went without th
eir help
    And to the last bended their light on me.
  Pol. Come, go with me. I will go seek the
 King.
    This is the very ecstasy of love,
    Whose violent property fordoes itself
    And le
ads the will to desperate undertakings
    As oft as any passion under heaven
    That does afflic
t our natures. I am sorry.
    What, have you given him any hard words of late?
  Oph. No, my good
 lord; but, as you did command,
    I did repel his letters and denied
    His access to me.
  Po
l. That hath made him mad.
    I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
    I had not quoted 
him. I fear'd he did but trifle
    And meant to wrack thee; but beshrew my jealousy!
    By heave
n, it is as proper to our age
    To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
    As it is common for
 the younger sort
    To lack discretion. Come, go we to the King.
    This must be known; which, 
being kept close, might move
    More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
    Come.
          
                                               Exeunt.

Scene II.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.


Flourish. [Enter King and Queen, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern,
cum aliis.

  King. Welcome, d
ear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
    Moreover that we much did long to see you,
    The need we h
ave to use you did provoke
    Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
    Of Hamlet's transfo
rmation. So I call it,
    Sith nor th' exterior nor the inward man
    Resembles that it was. Wha
t it should be,
    More than his father's death, that thus hath put him
    So much from th' unde
rstanding of himself,
    I cannot dream of. I entreat you both
    That, being of so young days b
rought up with him,
    And since so neighbour'd to his youth and haviour,
    That you vouchsafe 
your rest here in our court
    Some little time; so by your companies
    To draw him on to pleas
ures, and to gather
    So much as from occasion you may glean,
    Whether aught to us unknown af
flicts him thus
    That, open'd, lies within our remedy.
  Queen. Good gentlemen, he hath much ta
lk'd of you,
    And sure I am two men there are not living
    To whom he more adheres. If it wil
l please you
    To show us so much gentry and good will
    As to expend your time with us awhile

    For the supply and profit of our hope,
    Your visitation shall receive such thanks
    As 
fits a king's remembrance.
  Ros. Both your Majesties
    Might, by the sovereign power you have o
f us,
    Put your dread pleasures more into command
    Than to entreaty.
  Guil. But we both ob
ey,
    And here give up ourselves, in the full bent,
    To lay our service freely at your feet,

    To be commanded.
  King. Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
  Queen. Thanks, Guilde
nstern and gentle Rosencrantz.
    And I beseech you instantly to visit
    My too much changed so
n.- Go, some of you,
    And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
  Guil. Heavens make our prese
nce and our practices
    Pleasant and helpful to him!
  Queen. Ay, amen!
                 Exeunt
 Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, [with some
                                                    Atten
dants].

                         Enter Polonius.

  Pol. Th' ambassadors from Norway, my good l
ord,
    Are joyfully return'd.
  King. Thou still hast been the father of good news.
  Pol. Have
 I, my lord? Assure you, my good liege,
    I hold my duty as I hold my soul,
    Both to my God a
nd to my gracious king;
    And I do think- or else this brain of mine
    Hunts not the trail of 
policy so sure
    As it hath us'd to do- that I have found
    The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.

  King. O, speak of that! That do I long to hear.
  Pol. Give first admittance to th' ambassadors
.
    My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
  King. Thyself do grace to them, and bring 
them in.
                                                [Exit Polonius.]
    He tells me, my dear
 Gertrude, he hath found
    The head and source of all your son's distemper.
  Queen. I doubt it 
is no other but the main,
    His father's death and our o'erhasty marriage.
  King. Well, we shal
l sift him.

              Enter Polonius, Voltemand, and Cornelius.

    Welcome, my good frien
ds.
    Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?
  Volt. Most fair return of greetings and de
sires.
    Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
    His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd

    To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack,
    But better look'd into, he truly found
    It was
 against your Highness; whereat griev'd,
    That so his sickness, age, and impotence
    Was fals
ely borne in hand, sends out arrests
    On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys,
    Receives re
buke from Norway, and, in fine,
    Makes vow before his uncle never more
    To give th' assay of
 arms against your Majesty.
    Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
    Gives him three thousan
d crowns in annual fee
    And his commission to employ those soldiers,
    So levied as before, a
gainst the Polack;
    With an entreaty, herein further shown,
                                   
             [Gives a paper.]
    That it might please you to give quiet pass
    Through your dom
inions for this enterprise,
    On such regards of safety and allowance
    As therein are set dow
n.
  King. It likes us well;
    And at our more consider'd time we'll read,
    Answer, and thin
k upon this business.
    Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour.
    Go to your rest; at
 night we'll feast together.
    Most welcome home!                       Exeunt Ambassadors.
  Po
l. This business is well ended.
    My liege, and madam, to expostulate
    What majesty should be
, what duty is,
    Why day is day, night is night, and time is time.
    Were nothing but to wast
e night, day, and time.
    Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
    And tediousness the l
imbs and outward flourishes,
    I will be brief. Your noble son is mad.
    Mad call I it; for, t
o define true madness,
    What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
    But let that go.
  Queen
. More matter, with less art.
  Pol. Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
    That he is mad, 'tis 
true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
    And pity 'tis 'tis true. A foolish figure!
    But farewell it, for
 I will use no art.
    Mad let us grant him then. And now remains
    That we find out the cause 
of this effect-
    Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
    For this effect defective comes b
y cause.
    Thus it remains, and the remainder thus.
    Perpend.
    I have a daughter (have wh
ile she is mine),
    Who in her duty and obedience, mark,
    Hath given me this. Now gather, and
 surmise.
                                             [Reads] the letter.
    'To the celestial, 
and my soul's idol, the most beautified
      Ophelia,'-

    That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase
; 'beautified' is a vile
      phrase.
    But you shall hear. Thus:
                            
                            [Reads.]
    'In her excellent white bosom, these, &c.'
  Queen. Came 
this from Hamlet to her?
  Pol. Good madam, stay awhile. I will be faithful.     [Reads.]


    
      'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
            Doubt that the sun doth move;
          Doubt tr
uth to be a liar;
            But never doubt I love.
      'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these num
bers; I have not art
to
    reckon my groans; but that I love thee best, O most best,
believe
  
  it. Adieu.
      'Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to
him,

HAMLET.'


    This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me;
    And more above, hath his solicitings,
    A
s they fell out by time, by means, and place,
    All given to mine ear.
  King. But how hath she

    Receiv'd his love?
  Pol. What do you think of me?
  King. As of a man faithful and honourabl
e.
  Pol. I would fain prove so. But what might you think,
    When I had seen this hot love on th
e wing
    (As I perceiv'd it, I must tell you that,
    Before my daughter told me), what might y
ou,
    Or my dear Majesty your queen here, think,
    If I had play'd the desk or table book,
  
  Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
    Or look'd upon this love with idle sight?
    Wh
at might you think? No, I went round to work
    And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
    'Lo
rd Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star.
    This must not be.' And then I prescripts gave her,
   
 That she should lock herself from his resort,
    Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
    Whi
ch done, she took the fruits of my advice,
    And he, repulsed, a short tale to make,
    Fell in
to a sadness, then into a fast,
    Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
    Thence to a lig
htness, and, by this declension,
    Into the madness wherein now he raves,
    And all we mourn f
or.
  King. Do you think 'tis this?
  Queen. it may be, very like.
  Pol. Hath there been such a 
time- I would fain know that-
    That I have Positively said ''Tis so,'
    When it prov'd otherw
ise.?
  King. Not that I know.
  Pol. [points to his head and shoulder] Take this from this, if
t
his
      be otherwise.
    If circumstances lead me, I will find
    Where truth is hid, though 
it were hid indeed
    Within the centre.
  King. How may we try it further?
  Pol. You know some
times he walks for hours together
    Here in the lobby.
  Queen. So he does indeed.
  Pol. At su
ch a time I'll loose my daughter to him.
    Be you and I behind an arras then.
    Mark the encou
nter. If he love her not,
    And he not from his reason fall'n thereon
    Let me be no assistant
 for a state,
    But keep a farm and carters.
  King. We will try it.

                 Enter H
amlet, reading on a book.

  Queen. But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
  Pol. Aw
ay, I do beseech you, both away
    I'll board him presently. O, give me leave.
                  
     Exeunt King and Queen, [with Attendants].
    How does my good Lord Hamlet?
  Ham. Well, God-
a-mercy.
  Pol. Do you know me, my lord?
  Ham. Excellent well. You are a fishmonger.
  Pol. Not 
I, my lord.
  Ham. Then I would you were so honest a man.
  Pol. Honest, my lord?
  Ham. Ay, sir.
 To be honest, as this world goes, is to be one
man
    pick'd out of ten thousand.
  Pol. That's
 very true, my lord.
  Ham. For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god
    kissing ca
rrion- Have you a daughter?
  Pol. I have, my lord.
  Ham. Let her not walk i' th' sun. Conception
 is a blessing, but
not
    as your daughter may conceive. Friend, look to't.
  Pol. [aside] How 
say you by that? Still harping on my daughter.
Yet
    he knew me not at first. He said I was a fi
shmonger. He is
far
    gone, far gone! And truly in my youth I suff'red much
extremity
    for 
love- very near this. I'll speak to him again.- What do
you
    read, my lord?
  Ham. Words, word
s, words.
  Pol. What is the matter, my lord?
  Ham. Between who?
  Pol. I mean, the matter that 
you read, my lord.
  Ham. Slanders, sir; for the satirical rogue says here that old
men
    have 
grey beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes
    purging thick amber and plum-tree gum; a
nd that they have a
    plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams. All
which,
    sir, 
though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I
hold it
    not honesty to have it thus set d
own; for you yourself, sir,
    should be old as I am if, like a crab, you could go backward.

  
Pol. [aside] Though this be madness, yet there is a method
in't.-
   Will You walk out of the air,
 my lord?
  Ham. Into my grave?
  Pol. Indeed, that is out o' th' air. [Aside] How pregnant
somet
imes
    his replies are! a happiness that often madness hits on,
which
    reason and sanity cou
ld not so prosperously be delivered of.
I
    will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of me
eting
between
    him and my daughter.- My honourable lord, I will most humbly
take
    my leave
 of you.
  Ham. You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more
    willingly part withal-
 except my life, except my life, except
my
    life,

                    Enter Rosencrantz and 
Guildenstern.

  Pol. Fare you well, my lord.
  Ham. These tedious old fools!
  Pol. You go to s
eek the Lord Hamlet. There he is.
  Ros. [to Polonius] God save you, sir!
                        
                        Exit [Polonius].

  Guil. My honour'd lord!
  Ros. My most dear lord!
  
Ham. My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern?
Ah,
    Rosencrantz! Good lads, how d
o ye both?
  Ros. As the indifferent children of the earth.
  Guil. Happy in that we are not over-
happy.
    On Fortune's cap we are not the very button.
  Ham. Nor the soles of her shoe?
  Ros. 
Neither, my lord.
  Ham. Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her
    favours?
  Gu
il. Faith, her privates we.
  Ham. In the secret parts of Fortune? O! most true! she is a
    stru
mpet. What news ?
  Ros. None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
  Ham. Then is doomsday
 near! But your news is not true. Let me
    question more in particular. What have you, my good fr
iends,
    deserved at the hands of Fortune that she sends you to prison
    hither?
  Guil. Pris
on, my lord?
  Ham. Denmark's a prison.
  Ros. Then is the world one.
  Ham. A goodly one; in whi
ch there are many confines, wards, and
    dungeons, Denmark being one o' th' worst.
  Ros. We thi
nk not so, my lord.
  Ham. Why, then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either
good
    or ba
d but thinking makes it so. To me it is a prison.
  Ros. Why, then your ambition makes it one. 'Tis
 too narrow for
your
    mind.
  Ham. O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a

    king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.
  Guil. Which dreams indeed are am
bition; for the very substance
of
    the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
  Ham. A dre
am itself is but a shadow.
  Ros. Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality
that

    it is but a shadow's shadow.
  Ham. Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and
outstret
ch'd
    heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we to th' court? for, by
my
    fay, I cannot reason.

  Both. We'll wait upon you.
  Ham. No such matter! I will not sort you with the rest of my
    
servants; for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most
    dreadfully attended. But in the be
aten way of friendship,
what
    make you at Elsinore?
  Ros. To visit you, my lord; no other occ
asion.
  Ham. Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank
you;
    and sure, dear fri
ends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny.
Were
    you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is 
it a free
    visitation? Come, deal justly with me. Come, come! Nay,
speak.
  Guil. What should 
we say, my lord?
  Ham. Why, anything- but to th' purpose. You were sent for; and
    there is a k
ind of confession in your looks, which your
modesties
    have not craft enough to colour. I know 
the good King and
Queen
    have sent for you.
  Ros. To what end, my lord?
  Ham. That you must
 teach me. But let me conjure you by the
rights
    of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our yo
uth, by the
    obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear
a
    better propose
r could charge you withal, be even and direct
with
    me, whether you were sent for or no.
  Ros
. [aside to Guildenstern] What say you?
  Ham. [aside] Nay then, I have an eye of you.- If you love
 me,
hold
    not off.
  Guil. My lord, we were sent for.
  Ham. I will tell you why. So shall m
y anticipation prevent your
    discovery, and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no
    fea
ther. I have of late- but wherefore I know not- lost all
my
    mirth, forgone all custom of exerc
ises; and indeed, it goes
so
    heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the
earth,

    seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy,
the
    air, look you, this brav
e o'erhanging firmament, this
majestical
    roof fretted with golden fire- why, it appeareth no o
ther
thing
    to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What
a
    piece of work
 is a man! how noble in reason! how infinite in
    faculties! in form and moving how express and a
dmirable! in
    action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the
    beauty of the w
orld, the paragon of animals! And yet to me
what
    is this quintessence of dust? Man delights no
t me- no, nor
woman
    neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.
  Ros. My lord, there
 was no such stuff in my thoughts.
  Ham. Why did you laugh then, when I said 'Man delights not me'
?
  Ros. To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten
    entertainment the players s
hall receive from you. We coted
them
    on the way, and hither are they coming to offer you servi
ce.
  Ham. He that plays the king shall be welcome- his Majesty shall
    have tribute of me; the 
adventurous knight shall use his foil
and
    target; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humorou
s man
shall
    end his part in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose
    lungs are tickl
e o' th' sere; and the lady shall say her mind
    freely, or the blank verse shall halt for't. Wha
t players are
    they?
  Ros. Even those you were wont to take such delight in, the
    tragedia
ns of the city.
  Ham. How chances it they travel? Their residence, both in
    reputation and pro
fit, was better both ways.
  Ros. I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late
    inno
vation.
  Ham. Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in
the
    city? Are they so 
follow'd?
  Ros. No indeed are they not.
  Ham. How comes it? Do they grow rusty?
  Ros. Nay, the
ir endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there
is,
    sir, an eyrie of children, little eyases,
 that cry out on the
top
    of question and are most tyrannically clapp'd for't. These
are now

    the fashion, and so berattle the common stages (so they call
    them) that many wearing rapier
s are afraid of goosequills and
    dare scarce come thither.
  Ham. What, are they children? Who 
maintains 'em? How are they
    escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can
    
sing? Will they not say afterwards, if they should grow
    themselves to common players (as it is 
most like, if their
means
    are no better), their writers do them wrong to make them
exclaim
 
   against their own succession.
  Ros. Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the
na
tion
    holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy. There was, for
a
    while, no money bid f
or argument unless the poet and the
player
    went to cuffs in the question.
  Ham. Is't possibl
e?
  Guil. O, there has been much throwing about of brains.
  Ham. Do the boys carry it away?
  R
os. Ay, that they do, my lord- Hercules and his load too.
  Ham. It is not very strange; for my unc
le is King of Denmark,
and
    those that would make mows at him while my father lived give
    t
wenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his picture
in
    little. 'Sblood, there is some
thing in this more than
natural, if
    philosophy could find it out.

                     Flou
rish for the Players.

  Guil. There are the players.
  Ham. Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsino
re. Your hands, come!
Th'
    appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me
comply
   
 with you in this garb, lest my extent to the players (which I
    tell you must show fairly outwar
ds) should more appear like
    entertainment than yours. You are welcome. But my
uncle-father
  
  and aunt-mother are deceiv'd.
  Guil. In what, my dear lord?
  Ham. I am but mad north-north-wes
t. When the wind is southerly
I
    know a hawk from a handsaw.

                            Ent
er Polonius.

  Pol. Well be with you, gentlemen!
  Ham. Hark you, Guildenstern- and you too- at 
each ear a hearer!
    That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling
    clouts.

  Ros. Happily he's the second time come to them; for they say an
old
    man is twice a child.
 
 Ham. I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players. Mark
it.-
   You say right, sir; a Monda
y morning; twas so indeed.
  Pol. My lord, I have news to tell you.
  Ham. My lord, I have news to
 tell you. When Roscius was an
actor in
    Rome-
  Pol. The actors are come hither, my lord.
  
Ham. Buzz, buzz!
  Pol. Upon my honour-
  Ham. Then came each actor on his ass-
  Pol. The best a
ctors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy,
    history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical
-pastoral,
    tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral;
scene
    individable, 
or poem unlimited. Seneca cannot be too heavy,
nor
    Plautus too light. For the law of writ and 
the liberty, these
are
    the only men.
  Ham. O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hads
t thou!
  Pol. What treasure had he, my lord?
  Ham. Why,

         'One fair daughter, and no m
ore,
           The which he loved passing well.'

  Pol. [aside] Still on my daughter.
  Ham. A
m I not i' th' right, old Jephthah?
  Pol. If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that
 I
    love passing well.
  Ham. Nay, that follows not.
  Pol. What follows then, my lord?
  Ham
. Why,

           'As by lot, God wot,'

 and then, you know,

           'It came to pass, a
s most like it was.'

    The first row of the pious chanson will show you more; for
look
    wh
ere my abridgment comes.

                     Enter four or five Players.

    You are welcome,
 masters; welcome, all.- I am glad to see
thee
    well.- Welcome, good friends.- O, my old friend
? Why, thy
face is
    valanc'd since I saw thee last. Com'st' thou to' beard me in
    Denmark?-
 What, my young lady and mistress? By'r Lady, your
    ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw
 you last by the
    altitude of a chopine. Pray God your voice, like a piece of
    uncurrent gol
d, be not crack'd within the ring.- Masters, you
are
    all welcome. We'll e'en to't like French 
falconers, fly at
    anything we see. We'll have a speech straight. Come, give us
a
    taste of
 your quality. Come, a passionate speech.
  1. Play. What speech, my good lord?
  Ham. I heard the
e speak me a speech once, but it was never
acted;
    or if it was, not above once; for the play, 
I remember,
pleas'd
    not the million, 'twas caviary to the general; but it was (as
I
    rece
iv'd it, and others, whose judgments in such matters
cried in
    the top of mine) an excellent pl
ay, well digested in the
scenes,
    set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember one said

    there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter
savoury,
    nor no matter in the phra
se that might indict the author of
    affectation; but call'd it an honest method, as wholesome as

    sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech
in't
    I chiefly lov'd. 'Twas 
AEneas' tale to Dido, and thereabout
of it
    especially where he speaks of Priam's slaughter. If
 it live
in
    your memory, begin at this line- let me see, let me see:

         'The rugged P
yrrhus, like th' Hyrcanian beast-'

    'Tis not so; it begins with Pyrrhus:

         'The rugg
ed Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
         Black as his purpose, did the night resemble
         Wh
en he lay couched in the ominous horse,
         Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd

         With heraldry more dismal. Head to foot
         Now is be total gules, horridly trick'd

         With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
         Bak'd and impasted with the parc
hing streets,
         That lend a tyrannous and a damned light
         To their lord's murther. 
Roasted in wrath and fire,
         And thus o'ersized with coagulate gore,
         With eyes lik
e carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
         Old grandsire Priam seeks.'

    So, proceed you.
  P
ol. Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good
     discretion.

  1. Play. 'Anon 
he finds him,
      Striking too short at Greeks. His antique sword,
      Rebellious to his arm, 
lies where it falls,
      Repugnant to command. Unequal match'd,
      Pyrrhus at Priam drives, i
n rage strikes wide;
      But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
      Th' unnerved father
 falls. Then senseless Ilium,
      Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
      Stoops to hi
s base, and with a hideous crash
      Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear. For lo! his sword,
      Which
 was declining on the milky head
      Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' th' air to stick.
      So, as
 a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
      And, like a neutral to his will and matter,
      Did noth
ing.
      But, as we often see, against some storm,
      A silence in the heavens, the rack stan
d still,
      The bold winds speechless, and the orb below
      As hush as death- anon the dread
ful thunder
      Doth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
      Aroused vengeance sets him
 new awork;
      And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
      On Mars's armour, forg'd for proof
 eterne,
      With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
      Now falls on Priam.
      Out
, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods,
      In general synod take away her power;
      Brea
k all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
      And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,

      As low as to the fiends!

  Pol. This is too long.
  Ham. It shall to the barber's, with 
your beard.- Prithee say
on.
    He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps. Say on;
come t
o
    Hecuba.

  1. Play. 'But who, O who, had seen the mobled queen-'

  Ham. 'The mobled quee
n'?
  Pol. That's good! 'Mobled queen' is good.

  1. Play. 'Run barefoot up and down, threat'nin
g the flames
      With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head
      Where late the diadem stood, an
d for a robe,
      About her lank and all o'erteemed loins,
      A blanket, in the alarm of fear
 caught up-
      Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd
      'Gainst Fortune's state wo
uld treason have pronounc'd.
      But if the gods themselves did see her then,
      When she saw
 Pyrrhus make malicious sport
      In Mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,
      The insta
nt burst of clamour that she made
      (Unless things mortal move them not at all)
      Would ha
ve made milch the burning eyes of heaven
      And passion in the gods.'

  Pol. Look, whe'r he h
as not turn'd his colour, and has tears
in's
    eyes. Prithee no more!
  Ham. 'Tis well. I'll ha
ve thee speak out the rest of this
soon.-
    Good my lord, will you see the players well bestow'd
? Do you
    hear? Let them be well us'd; for they are the abstract and
brief
    chronicles of t
he time. After your death you were better have
a
    bad epitaph than their ill report while you l
ive.
  Pol. My lord, I will use them according to their desert.
  Ham. God's bodykins, man, much b
etter! Use every man after his
    desert, and who should scape whipping? Use them after your
own

    honour and dignity. The less they deserve, the more merit is
in
    your bounty. Take them in

  Pol. Come, sirs.
  Ham. Follow him, friends. We'll hear a play to-morrow.
                 Ex
eunt Polonius and Players [except the First].
    Dost thou hear me, old friend? Can you play 'The 
Murther of
    Gonzago'?
  1. Play. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, fo
r a need, study a
    speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which I would set down
and
    insert
 in't, could you not?
  1. Play. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Very well. Follow that lord- and look you moc
k him not.
                                            [Exit First Player.]
    My good friends, I
'll leave you till night. You are welcome
to
    Elsinore.
  Ros. Good my lord!
  Ham. Ay, so, G
od b' wi' ye!
                            [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
    Now I am alone.

    O what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
    Is it not monstrous that this player here,
    Bu
t in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
    Could force his soul so to his own conceit
    That, fr
om her working, all his visage wann'd,
    Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
    A broke
n voice, and his whole function suiting
    With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!
    Fo
r Hecuba!
    What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
    That he should weep for her? What would h
e do,
    Had he the motive and the cue for passion
    That I have? He would drown the stage with
 tears
    And cleave the general ear with horrid speech;
    Make mad the guilty and appal the fr
ee,
    Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed
    The very faculties of eyes and ears.
    Yet 
I,
    A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak
    Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
    
And can say nothing! No, not for a king,
    Upon whose property and most dear life
    A damn'd d
efeat was made. Am I a coward?
    Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
    Plucks off my 
beard and blows it in my face?
    Tweaks me by th' nose? gives me the lie i' th' throat
    As de
ep as to the lungs? Who does me this, ha?
    'Swounds, I should take it! for it cannot be
    But
 I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall
    To make oppression bitter, or ere this
    I should have fa
tted all the region kites
    With this slave's offal. Bloody bawdy villain!
    Remorseless, trea
cherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
    O, vengeance!
    Why, what an ass am I! This is most br
ave,
    That I, the son of a dear father murther'd,
    Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell
,
    Must (like a whore) unpack my heart with words
    And fall a-cursing like a very drab,
   
 A scullion!
    Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! Hum, I have heard
    That guilty creatures, si
tting at a play,
    Have by the very cunning of the scene
    Been struck so to the soul that pre
sently
    They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
    For murther, though it have no tongue, wil
l speak
    With most miraculous organ, I'll have these Players
    Play something like the murthe
r of my father
    Before mine uncle. I'll observe his looks;
    I'll tent him to the quick. If h
e but blench,
    I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
    May be a devil; and the devil 
hath power
    T' assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
    Out of my weakness and my melancho
ly,
    As he is very potent with such spirits,
    Abuses me to damn me. I'll have grounds
    M
ore relative than this. The play's the thing
    Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King.    
     Exit.

ACT III. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King, Qu
een, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern,
and Lords.

  King. And can you by no drift of
 circumstance
    Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
    Grating so harshly all his days 
of quiet
    With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
  Ros. He does confess he feels himself distract
ed,
    But from what cause he will by no means speak.
  Guil. Nor do we find him forward to be so
unded,
    But with a crafty madness keeps aloof
    When we would bring him on to some confession

    Of his true state.
  Queen. Did he receive you well?
  Ros. Most like a gentleman.
  Guil. 
But with much forcing of his disposition.
  Ros. Niggard of question, but of our demands
    Most 
free in his reply.
  Queen. Did you assay him
    To any pastime?
  Ros. Madam, it so fell out th
at certain players
    We o'erraught on the way. Of these we told him,
    And there did seem in h
im a kind of joy
    To hear of it. They are here about the court,
    And, as I think, they have 
already order
    This night to play before him.
  Pol. 'Tis most true;
    And he beseech'd me t
o entreat your Majesties
    To hear and see the matter.
  King. With all my heart, and it doth mu
ch content me
    To hear him so inclin'd.
    Good gentlemen, give him a further edge
    And dr
ive his purpose on to these delights.
  Ros. We shall, my lord.
                            Exeunt
 Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
  King. Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
    For we have closely sent 
for Hamlet hither,
    That he, as 'twere by accident, may here
    Affront Ophelia.
    Her fath
er and myself (lawful espials)
    Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing unseen,
    We may of the
ir encounter frankly judge
    And gather by him, as he is behav'd,
    If't be th' affliction of 
his love, or no,
    That thus he suffers for.
  Queen. I shall obey you;
    And for your part, 
Ophelia, I do wish
    That your good beauties be the happy cause
    Of Hamlet's wildness. So sha
ll I hope your virtues
    Will bring him to his wonted way again,
    To both your honours.
  Op
h. Madam, I wish it may.
                                                   [Exit Queen.]
  Pol. O
phelia, walk you here.- Gracious, so please you,
    We will bestow ourselves.- [To Ophelia] Read o
n this book,
    That show of such an exercise may colour
    Your loneliness.- We are oft to blam
e in this,
    'Tis too much prov'd, that with devotion's visage
    And pious action we do sugar 
o'er
    The Devil himself.
  King. [aside] O, 'tis too true!
    How smart a lash that speech do
th give my conscience!
    The harlot's cheek, beautied with plast'ring art,
    Is not more ugly 
to the thing that helps it
    Than is my deed to my most painted word.
    O heavy burthen!
  Po
l. I hear him coming. Let's withdraw, my lord.
                                      Exeunt King an
d Polonius].

                           Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. To be, or not to be- that is the 
question:
    Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
    The slings and arrows of outrageous fo
rtune
    Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
    And by opposing end them. To die- to slee
p-
    No more; and by a sleep to say we end
    The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks
 
   That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation
    Devoutly to be wish'd. To die- to sleep.
    To 
sleep- perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub!
    For in that sleep of death what dreams may come

    When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
    Must give us pause. There's the respect
    
That makes calamity of so long life.
    For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
    Th' 
oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
    The pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay,
   
 The insolence of office, and the spurns
    That patient merit of th' unworthy takes,
    When he
 himself might his quietus make
    With a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear,
    To grunt
 and sweat under a weary life,
    But that the dread of something after death-
    The undiscover
'd country, from whose bourn
    No traveller returns- puzzles the will,
    And makes us rather b
ear those ills we have
    Than fly to others that we know not of?
    Thus conscience does make c
owards of us all,
    And thus the native hue of resolution
    Is sicklied o'er with the pale cas
t of thought,
    And enterprises of great pith and moment
    With this regard their currents tur
n awry
    And lose the name of action.- Soft you now!
    The fair Ophelia!- Nymph, in thy orison
s
    Be all my sins rememb'red.
  Oph. Good my lord,
    How does your honour for this many a da
y?
  Ham. I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
  Oph. My lord, I have remembrances of yours
    
That I have longed long to re-deliver.
    I pray you, now receive them.
  Ham. No, not I!
    I 
never gave you aught.
  Oph. My honour'd lord, you know right well you did,
    And with them word
s of so sweet breath compos'd
    As made the things more rich. Their perfume lost,
    Take these
 again; for to the noble mind
    Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
    There, my lord
.
  Ham. Ha, ha! Are you honest?
  Oph. My lord?
  Ham. Are you fair?
  Oph. What means your lor
dship?
  Ham. That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit
no
    discourse to your 
beauty.
  Oph. Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with
honesty?
  Ham. Ay, truly; f
or the power of beauty will sooner transform
    honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force o
f honesty
can
    translate beauty into his likeness. This was sometime a
paradox,
    but now t
he time gives it proof. I did love you once.
  Oph. Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
  Ham
. You should not have believ'd me; for virtue cannot so
    inoculate our old stock but we shall re
lish of it. I loved
you
    not.
  Oph. I was the more deceived.
  Ham. Get thee to a nunnery! W
hy wouldst thou be a breeder of
    sinners? I am myself indifferent honest, but yet I could
accus
e
    me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne
me.
    I am very proud, reve
ngeful, ambitious; with more offences at
my
    beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imaginat
ion to give
    them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows
as I
    do, crawlin
g between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves
all;
    believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nun
nery. Where's your
    father?
  Oph. At home, my lord.
  Ham. Let the doors be shut upon him, th
at he may play the fool
    nowhere but in's own house. Farewell.
  Oph. O, help him, you sweet he
avens!
  Ham. If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy
dowry:
    be thou as chaste
 as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not
escape
    calumny. Get thee to a nunnery. Go, farewell. 
Or if thou wilt
    needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what
    monsters you
 make of them. To a nunnery, go; and quickly too.
    Farewell.
  Oph. O heavenly powers, restore 
him!
  Ham. I have heard of your paintings too, well enough. God hath
    given you one face, and 
you make yourselves another. You jig,
you
    amble, and you lisp; you nickname God's creatures an
d make
your
    wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't! it hath
made
    me mad. I 
say, we will have no more marriages. Those that are
    married already- all but one- shall live; t
he rest shall keep
as
    they are. To a nunnery, go.                            Exit.
  Oph. O, 
what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
    The courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword,

    Th' expectancy and rose of the fair state,
    The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
 
   Th' observ'd of all observers- quite, quite down!
    And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,

    That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
    Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
 
   Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
    That unmatch'd form and feature of blown yo
uth
    Blasted with ecstasy. O, woe is me
    T' have seen what I have seen, see what I see!

 
                  Enter King and Polonius.

  King. Love? his affections do not that way tend;
  
  Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,
    Was not like madness. There's something in
 his soul
    O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
    And I do doubt the hatch and the disclo
se
    Will be some danger; which for to prevent,
    I have in quick determination
    Thus set 
it down: he shall with speed to England
    For the demand of our neglected tribute.
    Haply the
 seas, and countries different,
    With variable objects, shall expel
    This something-settled 
matter in his heart,
    Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
    From fashion of himsel
f. What think you on't?
  Pol. It shall do well. But yet do I believe
    The origin and commencem
ent of his grief
    Sprung from neglected love.- How now, Ophelia?
    You need not tell us what 
Lord Hamlet said.
    We heard it all.- My lord, do as you please;
    But if you hold it fit, aft
er the play
    Let his queen mother all alone entreat him
    To show his grief. Let her be round
 with him;
    And I'll be plac'd so please you, in the ear
    Of all their conference. If she fi
nd him not,
    To England send him; or confine him where
    Your wisdom best shall think.
  Kin
g. It shall be so.
    Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.         Exeunt.




Scene 
II.
Elsinore. hall in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet and three of the Players.

  Ham. Speak the spe
ech, I pray you, as I pronounc'd it to you,
    trippingly on the tongue. But if you mouth it, as m
any of our
    players do, I had as live the town crier spoke my lines. Nor
do
    not saw the ai
r too much with your hand, thus, but use all
    gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and (as 
I may say)
    whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and beget a
    temperance that may giv
e it smoothness. O, it offends me to
the
    soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a
 passion
to
    tatters, to very rags, to split the cars of the groundlings,
who
    (for the mo
st part) are capable of nothing but inexplicable
dumb
    shows and noise. I would have such a fel
low whipp'd for
o'erdoing
    Termagant. It out-herods Herod. Pray you avoid it.
  Player. I warr
ant your honour.
  Ham. Be not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be
your
    tutor. S
uit the action to the word, the word to the action;
with
    this special observance, that you o'e
rstep not the modesty of
    nature: for anything so overdone is from the purpose of
playing,
   
 whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as
    'twere, the mirror up to nature;
 to show Virtue her own
feature,
    scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time
h
is
    form and pressure. Now this overdone, or come tardy off,
though
    it make the unskilful 
laugh, cannot but make the judicious
    grieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowanc
e
    o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that
I
    have seen play, and hea
rd others praise, and that highly (not
to
    speak it profanely), that, neither having the accent
 of
    Christians, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have
so
    strutted and bellowed 
that I have thought some of Nature's
    journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they
imi
tated
    humanity so abominably.
  Player. I hope we have reform'd that indifferently with us,
s
ir.
  Ham. O, reform it altogether! And let those that play your
clowns
    speak no more than is
 set down for them. For there be of them
    that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of
 barren
    spectators to laugh too, though in the mean time some
necessary
    question of the p
lay be then to be considered. That's
villanous
    and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool t
hat uses it.
Go
    make you ready.
                                                 Exeunt Playe
rs.

            Enter Polonius, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.

    How now, my lord? Will the 
King hear this piece of work?
  Pol. And the Queen too, and that presently.
  Ham. Bid the players
 make haste, [Exit Polonius.] Will you two
    help to hasten them?
  Both. We will, my lord.     
                  Exeunt they two.
  Ham. What, ho, Horatio!

                      Enter Horatio
.

  Hor. Here, sweet lord, at your service.
  Ham. Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
    As 
e'er my conversation cop'd withal.
  Hor. O, my dear lord!
  Ham. Nay, do not think I flatter;
  
  For what advancement may I hope from thee,
    That no revenue hast but thy good spirits
    To 
feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
    No, let the candied tongue lick absurd 
pomp,
    And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
    Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou
 hear?
    Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
    And could of men distinguish, her ele
ction
    Hath seal'd thee for herself. For thou hast been
    As one, in suff'ring all, that suff
ers nothing;
    A man that Fortune's buffets and rewards
    Hast ta'en with equal thanks; and bl
est are those
    Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled
    That they are not a pipe for
 Fortune's finger
    To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
    That is not passion's sl
ave, and I will wear him
    In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
    As I do thee. Somet
hing too much of this I
    There is a play to-night before the King.
    One scene of it comes ne
ar the circumstance,
    Which I have told thee, of my father's death.
    I prithee, when thou se
est that act afoot,
    Even with the very comment of thy soul
    Observe my uncle. If his occult
ed guilt
    Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
    It is a damned ghost that we have seen,
  
  And my imaginations are as foul
    As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
    For I mine ey
es will rivet to his face,
    And after we will both our judgments join
    In censure of his see
ming.
  Hor. Well, my lord.
    If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
    And scape 
detecting, I will pay the theft.

    Sound a flourish. [Enter Trumpets and Kettledrums. Danish
 
   march. [Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz,
      Guildenstern, and other Lords a
ttendant, with the Guard
                       carrying torches.

  Ham. They are coming to the 
play. I must be idle.
    Get you a place.
  King. How fares our cousin Hamlet?
  Ham. Excellent,
 i' faith; of the chameleon's dish. I eat the
air,
    promise-cramm'd. You cannot feed capons so.

  King. I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet. These words are
not
    mine.
  Ham. No, nor m
ine now. [To Polonius] My lord, you play'd once
    i' th' university, you say?
  Pol. That did I,
 my lord, and was accounted a good actor.
  Ham. What did you enact?
  Pol. I did enact Julius Cae
sar; I was kill'd i' th' Capitol;
Brutus
    kill'd me.
  Ham. It was a brute part of him to kill
 so capital a calf
there. Be
    the players ready.
  Ros. Ay, my lord. They stay upon your patie
nce.
  Queen. Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
  Ham. No, good mother. Here's metal more at
tractive.
  Pol. [to the King] O, ho! do you mark that?
  Ham. Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
   
                               [Sits down at Ophelia's feet.]

  Oph. No, my lord.
  Ham. I mean,
 my head upon your lap?
  Oph. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Do you think I meant country matters?
  Oph. I
 think nothing, my lord.
  Ham. That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
  Oph. What is, 
my lord?
  Ham. Nothing.
  Oph. You are merry, my lord.
  Ham. Who, I?
  Oph. Ay, my lord.
  Ha
m. O God, your only jig-maker! What should a man do but be
merry?
    For look you how cheerfully 
my mother looks, and my father
died
    within 's two hours.
  Oph. Nay 'tis twice two months, my
 lord.
  Ham. So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I'll have
a
    suit of sables. O 
heavens! die two months ago, and not
forgotten
    yet? Then there's hope a great man's memory may
 outlive his
life
    half a year. But, by'r Lady, he must build churches then; or
else
    shal
l he suffer not thinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose

    epitaph is 'For O, for O, the hobby-
horse is forgot!'

               Hautboys play. The dumb show enters.

    Enter a King and a Q
ueen very lovingly; the Queen embracing
    him and he her. She kneels, and makes show of protestat
ion
    unto him. He takes her up, and declines his head upon her
    neck. He lays him down upon 
a bank of flowers. She, seeing
    him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his
 
   crown, kisses it, pours poison in the sleeper's ears, and
    leaves him. The Queen returns, fin
ds the King dead, and makes
    passionate action. The Poisoner with some three or four
Mutes,
  
  comes in again, seem to condole with her. The dead body is
    carried away. The Poisoner wooes t
he Queen with gifts; she
    seems harsh and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts
    his love
.
                                                         Exeunt.

  Oph. What means this, my lo
rd?
  Ham. Marry, this is miching malhecho; it means mischief.
  Oph. Belike this show imports the
 argument of the play.

                      Enter Prologue.

  Ham. We shall know by this fell
ow. The players cannot keep
counsel;
    they'll tell all.
  Oph. Will he tell us what this show 
meant?
  Ham. Ay, or any show that you'll show him. Be not you asham'd
to
    show, he'll not sha
me to tell you what it means.
  Oph. You are naught, you are naught! I'll mark the play.

    Pro
. For us, and for our tragedy,
      Here stooping to your clemency,
      We beg your hearing pat
iently.                     [Exit.]

  Ham. Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
  Oph. 'Ti
s brief, my lord.
  Ham. As woman's love.

              Enter [two Players as] King and Queen.


    King. Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round
      Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' o
rbed ground,
      And thirty dozen moons with borrowed sheen
      About the world have times twe
lve thirties been,
      Since love our hearts, and Hymen did our hands,
      Unite comutual in m
ost sacred bands.
    Queen. So many journeys may the sun and moon
      Make us again count o'er 
ere love be done!
      But woe is me! you are so sick of late,
      So far from cheer and from y
our former state.
      That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
      Discomfort you, my lord
, it nothing must;
      For women's fear and love holds quantity,
      In neither aught, or in e
xtremity.
      Now what my love is, proof hath made you know;
      And as my love is siz'd, my f
ear is so.
      Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
      Where little fears grow 
great, great love grows there.
    King. Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;
      My
 operant powers their functions leave to do.
      And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,

      Honour'd, belov'd, and haply one as kind
      For husband shalt thou-
    Queen. O, confoun
d the rest!
      Such love must needs be treason in my breast.
      When second husband let me b
e accurst!
      None wed the second but who killed the first.

  Ham. [aside] Wormwood, wormwood
!

    Queen. The instances that second marriage move
      Are base respects of thrift, but none
 of love.
      A second time I kill my husband dead
      When second husband kisses me in bed.

    King. I do believe you think what now you speak;
      But what we do determine oft we break.

      Purpose is but the slave to memory,
      Of violent birth, but poor validity;
      Which n
ow, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree,
      But fall unshaken when they mellow be.
      Most
 necessary 'tis that we forget
      To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt.
      What to our
selves in passion we propose,
      The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
      The violence 
of either grief or joy
      Their own enactures with themselves destroy.
      Where joy most rev
els, grief doth most lament;
      Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
      This world 
is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
      That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
  
    For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
      Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love
.
      The great man down, you mark his favourite flies,
      The poor advanc'd makes friends of
 enemies;
      And hitherto doth love on fortune tend,
      For who not needs shall never lack a
 friend,
      And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
      Directly seasons him his enemy.
  
    But, orderly to end where I begun,
      Our wills and fates do so contrary run
      That our
 devices still are overthrown;
      Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own.
      So t
hink thou wilt no second husband wed;
      But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
    
Queen. Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light,
      Sport and repose lock from me day and nig
ht,
      To desperation turn my trust and hope,
      An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope,
 
     Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
      Meet what I would have well, and it destroy,

      Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
      If, once a widow, ever I be wife!

  Ha
m. If she should break it now!

    King. 'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile.
      M
y spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile
      The tedious day with sleep.
    Queen. Sleep r
ock thy brain,
                                                    [He] sleeps.
      And never co
me mischance between us twain!
Exit.

  Ham. Madam, how like you this play?
  Queen. The lady do
th protest too much, methinks.
  Ham. O, but she'll keep her word.
  King. Have you heard the argu
ment? Is there no offence in't?
  Ham. No, no! They do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i'
th'

    world.
  King. What do you call the play?
  Ham. 'The Mousetrap.' Marry, how? Tropically. Th
is play is the
    image of a murther done in Vienna. Gonzago is the duke's
name;
    his wife, B
aptista. You shall see anon. 'Tis a knavish piece
of
    work; but what o' that? Your Majesty, and
 we that have free
    souls, it touches us not. Let the gall'd jade winch; our
withers
    are u
nwrung.

                         Enter Lucianus.

    This is one Lucianus, nephew to the King.

  Oph. You are as good as a chorus, my lord.
  Ham. I could interpret between you and your love, 
if I could
see
    the puppets dallying.
  Oph. You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
  Ham. It w
ould cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
  Oph. Still better, and worse.
  Ham. So you must t
ake your husbands.- Begin, murtherer. Pox,
leave
    thy damnable faces, and begin! Come, the croa
king raven doth
    bellow for revenge.

    Luc. Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time 
agreeing;
      Confederate season, else no creature seeing;
      Thou mixture rank, of midnight 
weeds collected,
      With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,
      Thy natural magic 
and dire property
      On wholesome life usurp immediately.
                                   Po
urs the poison in his ears.

  Ham. He poisons him i' th' garden for's estate. His name's
Gonzago
.
    The story is extant, and written in very choice Italian. You
    shall see anon how the murt
herer gets the love of Gonzago's
wife.
  Oph. The King rises.
  Ham. What, frighted with false fi
re?
  Queen. How fares my lord?
  Pol. Give o'er the play.
  King. Give me some light! Away!
  A
ll. Lights, lights, lights!
                              Exeunt all but Hamlet and Horatio.
  Ham
.   Why, let the strucken deer go weep,
          The hart ungalled play;
         For some must w
atch, while some must sleep:
          Thus runs the world away.
    Would not this, sir, and a fo
rest of feathers- if the rest of
my
    fortunes turn Turk with me-with two Provincial roses on my

raz'd
    shoes, get me a fellowship in a cry of players, sir?
  Hor. Half a share.
  Ham.   A 
whole one I!
         For thou dost know, O Damon dear,
           This realm dismantled was
    
     Of Jove himself; and now reigns here
           A very, very- pajock.
  Hor. You might have r
hym'd.
  Ham. O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand
    pound! Didst perceive?

  Hor. Very well, my lord.
  Ham. Upon the talk of the poisoning?
  Hor. I did very well note hi
m.
  Ham.   Aha! Come, some music! Come, the recorders!
         For if the King like not the come
dy,
         Why then, belike he likes it not, perdy.
    Come, some music!

                Ent
er Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Guil. Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.
  Ham. Sir,
 a whole history.
  Guil. The King, sir-
  Ham. Ay, sir, what of him?
  Guil. Is in his retiremen
t, marvellous distemper'd.
  Ham. With drink, sir?
  Guil. No, my lord; rather with choler.
  Ham
. Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this
to
    the doctor; for me to put him 
to his purgation would perhaps
    plunge him into far more choler.
  Guil. Good my lord, put your
 discourse into some frame, and
start
    not so wildly from my affair.
  Ham. I am tame, sir; pr
onounce.
  Guil. The Queen, your mother, in most great affliction of
spirit
    hath sent me to y
ou.
  Ham. You are welcome.
  Guil. Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right
breed.

    If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, I will
do
    your mother's commandment;
 if not, your pardon and my return
    shall be the end of my business.
  Ham. Sir, I cannot.
  G
uil. What, my lord?
  Ham. Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseas'd. But, sir,
such
    ans
wer as I can make, you shall command; or rather, as you
say,
    my mother. Therefore no more, but
 to the matter! My mother,
you
    say-
  Ros. Then thus she says: your behaviour hath struck her
 into
    amazement and admiration.
  Ham. O wonderful son, that can so stonish a mother! But is

there no
    sequel at the heels of this mother's admiration? Impart.
  Ros. She desires to speak 
with you in her closet ere you go to
bed.
  Ham. We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Hav
e you any
    further trade with us?
  Ros. My lord, you once did love me.
  Ham. And do still, b
y these pickers and stealers!
  Ros. Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? You do
surely

    bar the door upon your own liberty, if you deny your griefs
to
    your friend.
  Ham. Sir, 
I lack advancement.
  Ros. How can that be, when you have the voice of the King
himself
    for y
our succession in Denmark?
  Ham. Ay, sir, but 'while the grass grows'- the proverb is
something

    musty.

                     Enter the Players with recorders.

    O, the recorders! Let me
 see one. To withdraw with you- why
do
    you go about to recover the wind of me, as if you would
 drive
me
    into a toil?
  Guil. O my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too
unmannerly.

  Ham. I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this
pipe?
  Guil. My lord, I cannot.

  Ham. I pray you.
  Guil. Believe me, I cannot.
  Ham. I do beseech you.
  Guil. I know, no touc
h of it, my lord.
  Ham. It is as easy as lying. Govern these ventages with your
    fingers and t
humbs, give it breath with your mouth, and it
will
    discourse most eloquent music. Look you, th
ese are the stops.
  Guil. But these cannot I command to any utt'rance of harmony. I
    have not 
the skill.
  Ham. Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me!
You
    would play upon
 me; you would seem to know my stops; you
would
    pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would s
ound me from my
    lowest note to the top of my compass; and there is much
music,
    excellent 
voice, in this little organ, yet cannot you make it
    speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am easier to
 be play'd on than
a
    pipe? Call me what instrument you will, though you can fret
me,
    you
 cannot play upon me.

                        Enter Polonius.

    God bless you, sir!
  Pol. 
My lord, the Queen would speak with you, and presently.
  Ham. Do you see yonder cloud that's almos
t in shape of a camel?
  Pol. By th' mass, and 'tis like a camel indeed.
  Ham. Methinks it is lik
e a weasel.
  Pol. It is back'd like a weasel.
  Ham. Or like a whale.
  Pol. Very like a whale.

  Ham. Then will I come to my mother by-and-by.- They fool me to
the
    top of my bent.- I will 
come by-and-by.
  Pol. I will say so.                                      Exit.
  Ham. 'By-and-by
' is easily said.- Leave me, friends.
                                        [Exeunt all but Hamle
t.]

    'Tis now the very witching time of night,
    When churchyards yawn, and hell itself bre
athes out
    Contagion to this world. Now could I drink hot blood
    And do such bitter business
 as the day
    Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother!
    O heart, lose not thy nature; 
let not ever
    The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom.
    Let me be cruel, not unnatural;
    
I will speak daggers to her, but use none.
    My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites-
    How i
n my words somever she be shent,
    To give them seals never, my soul, consent!             Exit.





Scene III.
A room in the Castle.

Enter King, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.

  King. 
I like him not, nor stands it safe with us
    To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;
  
  I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
    And he to England shall along with you.
    The t
erms of our estate may not endure
    Hazard so near us as doth hourly grow
    Out of his lunacie
s.
  Guil. We will ourselves provide.
    Most holy and religious fear it is
    To keep those ma
ny many bodies safe
    That live and feed upon your Majesty.
  Ros. The single and peculiar life 
is bound
    With all the strength and armour of the mind
    To keep itself from noyance; but muc
h more
    That spirit upon whose weal depends and rests
    The lives of many. The cesse of majes
ty
    Dies not alone, but like a gulf doth draw
    What's near it with it. It is a massy wheel,

    Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,
    To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things

    Are mortis'd and adjoin'd; which when it falls,
    Each small annexment, petty consequence,

    Attends the boist'rous ruin. Never alone
    Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.
  Ki
ng. Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;
    For we will fetters put upon this fear,
    Wh
ich now goes too free-footed.
  Both. We will haste us.
                                          
     Exeunt Gentlemen.

                   Enter Polonius.

  Pol. My lord, he's going to his mo
ther's closet.
    Behind the arras I'll convey myself
    To hear the process. I'll warrant she'l
l tax him home;
    And, as you said, and wisely was it said,
    'Tis meet that some more audienc
e than a mother,
    Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear
    The speech, of vantage. 
Fare you well, my liege.
    I'll call upon you ere you go to bed
    And tell you what I know.
 
 King. Thanks, dear my lord.
                                                Exit [Polonius].
    
O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven;
    It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,
    A brot
her's murther! Pray can I not,
    Though inclination be as sharp as will.
    My stronger guilt d
efeats my strong intent,
    And, like a man to double business bound,
    I stand in pause where 
I shall first begin,
    And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
    Were thicker than itself w
ith brother's blood,
    Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
    To wash it white as sno
w? Whereto serves mercy
    But to confront the visage of offence?
    And what's in prayer but th
is twofold force,
    To be forestalled ere we come to fall,
    Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll
 look up;
    My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer
    Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my 
foul murther'?
    That cannot be; since I am still possess'd
    Of those effects for which I did
 the murther-
    My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.
    May one be pardon'd and retain th
' offence?
    In the corrupted currents of this world
    Offence's gilded hand may shove by just
ice,
    And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
    Buys out the law; but 'tis not so above.
 
   There is no shuffling; there the action lies
    In his true nature, and we ourselves compell'd,

    Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
    To give in evidence. What then? What rests?

    Try what repentance can. What can it not?
    Yet what can it when one cannot repent?
    O 
wretched state! O bosom black as death!
    O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
    Art mor
e engag'd! Help, angels! Make assay.
    Bow, stubborn knees; and heart with strings of steel,
   
 Be soft as sinews of the new-born babe!
    All may be well.                                  He k
neels.

                         Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;

    And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven,
    And so am I reveng'd. That would be scann'd.

    A villain kills my father; and for that,
    I, his sole son, do this same villain send
    
To heaven.
    Why, this is hire and salary, not revenge!
    He took my father grossly, full of b
read,
    With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
    And how his audit stands, who know
s save heaven?
    But in our circumstance and course of thought,
    'Tis heavy with him; and am 
I then reveng'd,
    To take him in the purging of his soul,
    When he is fit and seasoned for h
is passage?
    No.
    Up, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent.
    When he is drunk asleep;
 or in his rage;
    Or in th' incestuous pleasure of his bed;
    At gaming, swearing, or about s
ome act
    That has no relish of salvation in't-
    Then trip him, that his heels may kick at he
aven,
    And that his soul may be as damn'd and black
    As hell, whereto it goes. My mother sta
ys.
    This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.              Exit.
  King. [rises] My words fly 
up, my thoughts remain below.
    Words without thoughts never to heaven go.             Exit.





Scene IV.
The Queen's closet.

Enter Queen and Polonius.

  Pol. He will come straight. Lo
ok you lay home to him.
    Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,
    And that you
r Grace hath screen'd and stood between
    Much heat and him. I'll silence me even here.
    Pray
 you be round with him.
  Ham. (within) Mother, mother, mother!
  Queen. I'll warrant you; fear me
 not. Withdraw; I hear him
coming.
                              [Polonius hides behind the arras.
]

                          Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Now, mother, what's the matter?
  Queen. Ham
let, thou hast thy father much offended.
  Ham. Mother, you have my father much offended.
  Queen.
 Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
  Ham. Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
  Q
ueen. Why, how now, Hamlet?
  Ham. What's the matter now?
  Queen. Have you forgot me?
  Ham. No,
 by the rood, not so!
    You are the Queen, your husband's brother's wife,
    And (would it were
 not so!) you are my mother.
  Queen. Nay, then I'll set those to you that can speak.
  Ham. Come,
 come, and sit you down. You shall not budge;
    You go not till I set you up a glass
    Where y
ou may see the inmost part of you.
  Queen. What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murther me?
    Help,
 help, ho!
  Pol. [behind] What, ho! help, help, help!
  Ham. [draws] How now? a rat? Dead for a d
ucat, dead!
            [Makes a pass through the arras and] kills Polonius.
  Pol. [behind] O, I 
am slain!
  Queen. O me, what hast thou done?
  Ham. Nay, I know not. Is it the King?
  Queen. O,
 what a rash and bloody deed is this!
  Ham. A bloody deed- almost as bad, good mother,
    As kil
l a king, and marry with his brother.
  Queen. As kill a king?
  Ham. Ay, lady, it was my word.
 
                        [Lifts up the arras and sees Polonius.]
    Thou wretched, rash, intruding 
fool, farewell!
    I took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune.
    Thou find'st to be too busy 
is some danger.
    Leave wringing of your hands. Peace! sit you down
    And let me wring your he
art; for so I shall
    If it be made of penetrable stuff;
    If damned custom have not braz'd it
 so
    That it is proof and bulwark against sense.
  Queen. What have I done that thou dar'st wag
 thy tongue
    In noise so rude against me?
  Ham. Such an act
    That blurs the grace and blus
h of modesty;
    Calls virtue hypocrite; takes off the rose
    From the fair forehead of an inno
cent love,
    And sets a blister there; makes marriage vows
    As false as dicers' oaths. O, suc
h a deed
    As from the body of contraction plucks
    The very soul, and sweet religion makes
 
   A rhapsody of words! Heaven's face doth glow;
    Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
    Wit
h tristful visage, as against the doom,
    Is thought-sick at the act.
  Queen. Ah me, what act,

    That roars so loud and thunders in the index?
  Ham. Look here upon th's picture, and on this,

    The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
    See what a grace was seated on this brow;
 
   Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
    An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
   
 A station like the herald Mercury
    New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill:
    A combination and
 a form indeed
    Where every god did seem to set his seal
    To give the world assurance of a m
an.
    This was your husband. Look you now what follows.
    Here is your husband, like a mildew'
d ear
    Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
    Could you on this fair mountain leave
 to feed,
    And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes
    You cannot call it love; for at your 
age
    The heyday in the blood is tame, it's humble,
    And waits upon the judgment; and what ju
dgment
    Would step from this to this? Sense sure you have,
    Else could you not have motion; 
but sure that sense
    Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,
    Nor sense to ecstacy was ne'e
r so thrall'd
    But it reserv'd some quantity of choice
    To serve in such a difference. What 
devil was't
    That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
    Eyes without feeling, feeling wit
hout sight,
    Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
    Or but a sickly part of one tru
e sense
    Could not so mope.
    O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
    If thou cans
t mutine in a matron's bones,
    To flaming youth let virtue be as wax
    And melt in her own fi
re. Proclaim no shame
    When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
    Since frost itself as a
ctively doth burn,
    And reason panders will.
  Queen. O Hamlet, speak no more!
    Thou turn's
t mine eyes into my very soul,
    And there I see such black and grained spots
    As will not le
ave their tinct.
  Ham. Nay, but to live
    In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
    Stew'd in 
corruption, honeying and making love
    Over the nasty sty!
  Queen. O, speak to me no more!
   
 These words like daggers enter in mine ears.
    No more, sweet Hamlet!
  Ham. A murtherer and a 
villain!
    A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
    Of your precedent lord; a vice of ki
ngs;
    A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
    That from a shelf the precious diadem stole
 
   And put it in his pocket!
  Queen. No more!

                Enter the Ghost in his nightgown.


  Ham. A king of shreds and patches!-
    Save me and hover o'er me with your wings,
    You h
eavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?
  Queen. Alas, he's mad!
  Ham. Do you not come y
our tardy son to chide,
    That, laps'd in time and passion, lets go by
    Th' important acting 
of your dread command?
    O, say!
  Ghost. Do not forget. This visitation
    Is but to whet thy
 almost blunted purpose.
    But look, amazement on thy mother sits.
    O, step between her and h
er fighting soul
    Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works.
    Speak to her, Hamlet.
  Ham. 
How is it with you, lady?
  Queen. Alas, how is't with you,
    That you do bend your eye on vacan
cy,
    And with th' encorporal air do hold discourse?
    Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly 
peep;
    And, as the sleeping soldiers in th' alarm,
    Your bedded hairs, like life in excremen
ts,
    Start up and stand an end. O gentle son,
    Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
   
 Sprinkle cool patience! Whereon do you look?
  Ham. On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!

    His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
    Would make them capable.- Do not look up
on me,
    Lest with this piteous action you convert
    My stern effects. Then what I have to do

    Will want true colour- tears perchance for blood.
  Queen. To whom do you speak this?
  Ham. 
Do you see nothing there?
  Queen. Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
  Ham. Nor did you nothi
ng hear?
  Queen. No, nothing but ourselves.
  Ham. Why, look you there! Look how it steals away!

    My father, in his habit as he liv'd!
    Look where he goes even now out at the portal!
     
                                                Exit Ghost.
  Queen. This is the very coinage of yo
ur brain.
    This bodiless creation ecstasy
    Is very cunning in.
  Ham. Ecstasy?
    My puls
e as yours doth temperately keep time
    And makes as healthful music. It is not madness
    That
 I have utt'red. Bring me to the test,
    And I the matter will reword; which madness
    Would g
ambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
    Lay not that flattering unction to your soul
    That n
ot your trespass but my madness speaks.
    It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
    Whil
es rank corruption, mining all within,
    Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
    Repent 
what's past; avoid what is to come;
    And do not spread the compost on the weeds
    To make the
m ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;
    For in the fatness of these pursy times
    Virtue itself
 of vice must pardon beg-
    Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.
  Queen. O Hamlet, thou 
hast cleft my heart in twain.
  Ham. O, throw away the worser part of it,
    And live the purer w
ith the other half,
    Good night- but go not to my uncle's bed.
    Assume a virtue, if you have
 it not.
    That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat
    Of habits evil, is angel yet in this
,
    That to the use of actions fair and good
    He likewise gives a frock or livery,
    That 
aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,
    And that shall lend a kind of easiness
    To the next abst
inence; the next more easy;
    For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
    And either [mas
ter] the devil, or throw him out
    With wondrous potency. Once more, good night;
    And when yo
u are desirous to be blest,
    I'll blessing beg of you.- For this same lord,
    I do repent; bu
t heaven hath pleas'd it so,
    To punish me with this, and this with me,
    That I must be thei
r scourge and minister.
    I will bestow him, and will answer well
    The death I gave him. So a
gain, good night.
    I must be cruel, only to be kind;
    Thus bad begins, and worse remains beh
ind.
    One word more, good lady.
  Queen. What shall I do?
  Ham. Not this, by no means, that I
 bid you do:
    Let the bloat King tempt you again to bed;
    Pinch wanton on your cheek; call y
ou his mouse;
    And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
    Or paddling in your neck with his 
damn'd fingers,
    Make you to ravel all this matter out,
    That I essentially am not in madnes
s,
    But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;
    For who that's but a queen, fair, sober
, wise,
    Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib
    Such dear concernings hide? Who would do s
o?
    No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
    Unpeg the basket on the house's top,
    Let the 
birds fly, and like the famous ape,
    To try conclusions, in the basket creep
    And break your
 own neck down.
  Queen. Be thou assur'd, if words be made of breath,
    And breath of life, I ha
ve no life to breathe
    What thou hast said to me.
  Ham. I must to England; you know that?
  Q
ueen. Alack,
    I had forgot! 'Tis so concluded on.
  Ham. There's letters seal'd; and my two sch
oolfellows,
    Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,
    They bear the mandate; they must sw
eep my way
    And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
    For 'tis the sport to have the enginer

    Hoist with his own petar; and 't shall go hard
    But I will delve one yard below their mines

    And blow them at the moon. O, 'tis most sweet
    When in one line two crafts directly meet.

    This man shall set me packing.
    I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.-
    Mother, go
od night.- Indeed, this counsellor
    Is now most still, most secret, and most grave,
    Who was
 in life a foolish peating knave.
    Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.
    Good night, m
other.
                  [Exit the Queen. Then] Exit Hamlet, tugging in
                          
                             Polonius.

ACT IV. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in th
e Castle.

Enter King and Queen, with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  King. There's matter in t
hese sighs. These profound heaves
    You must translate; 'tis fit we understand them.
    Where i
s your son?
  Queen. Bestow this place on us a little while.
                          [Exeunt Ros
encrantz and Guildenstern.]
    Ah, mine own lord, what have I seen to-night!
  King. What, Gertru
de? How does Hamlet?
  Queen. Mad as the sea and wind when both contend
    Which is the mightier.
 In his lawless fit
    Behind the arras hearing something stir,
    Whips out his rapier, cries '
A rat, a rat!'
    And in this brainish apprehension kills
    The unseen good old man.
  King. O
 heavy deed!
    It had been so with us, had we been there.
    His liberty is full of threats to 
all-
    To you yourself, to us, to every one.
    Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?

    It will be laid to us, whose providence
    Should have kept short, restrain'd, and out of haun
t
    This mad young man. But so much was our love
    We would not understand what was most fit,

    But, like the owner of a foul disease,
    To keep it from divulging, let it feed
    Even on
 the pith of life. Where is he gone?
  Queen. To draw apart the body he hath kill'd;
    O'er whom
 his very madness, like some ore
    Among a mineral of metals base,
    Shows itself pure. He wee
ps for what is done.
  King. O Gertrude, come away!
    The sun no sooner shall the mountains touc
h
    But we will ship him hence; and this vile deed
    We must with all our majesty and skill
 
   Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!

             Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
.

    Friends both, go join you with some further aid.
    Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain
,
    And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him.
    Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring
 the body
    Into the chapel. I pray you haste in this.
                          Exeunt [Rosencr
antz and Guildenstern].
    Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends
    And let them know
 both what we mean to do
    And what's untimely done. [So haply slander-]
    Whose whisper o'er 
the world's diameter,
    As level as the cannon to his blank,
    Transports his poisoned shot- m
ay miss our name
    And hit the woundless air.- O, come away!
    My soul is full of discord and 
dismay.
                                                         Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsino
re. A passage in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Safely stow'd.
  Gentlemen. (within) Hamlet
! Lord Hamlet!
  Ham. But soft! What noise? Who calls on Hamlet? O, here they
come.

           
    Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Ros. What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?

  Ham. Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
  Ros. Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it th
ence
    And bear it to the chapel.
  Ham. Do not believe it.
  Ros. Believe what?
  Ham. That I
 can keep your counsel, and not mine own. Besides,
to be
    demanded of a sponge, what replicatio
n should be made by the
son
    of a king?
  Ros. Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
  Ham. Ay, 
sir; that soaks up the King's countenance, his
rewards,
    his authorities. But such officers do 
the King best service
in
    the end. He keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his
jaw;
    
first mouth'd, to be last swallowed. When he needs what you
have
    glean'd, it is but squeezing 
you and, sponge, you shall be
dry
    again.
  Ros. I understand you not, my lord.
  Ham. I am g
lad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.
  Ros. My lord, you must tell us where the bod
y is and go with us
to
    the King.
  Ham. The body is with the King, but the King is not with t
he
body.
    The King is a thing-
  Guil. A thing, my lord?
  Ham. Of nothing. Bring me to him. 
Hide fox, and all after.
                                                         Exeunt.





Scene III.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King.

  King. I have sent to seek him and to
 find the body.
    How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
    Yet must not we put the stro
ng law on him.
    He's lov'd of the distracted multitude,
    Who like not in their judgment, but
 their eyes;
    And where 'tis so, th' offender's scourge is weigh'd,
    But never the offence. 
To bear all smooth and even,
    This sudden sending him away must seem
    Deliberate pause. Dise
ases desperate grown
    By desperate appliance are reliev'd,
    Or not at all.

              
      Enter Rosencrantz.

    How now O What hath befall'n?
  Ros. Where the dead body is bestow'
d, my lord,
    We cannot get from him.
  King. But where is he?
  Ros. Without, my lord; guarded
, to know your pleasure.
  King. Bring him before us.
  Ros. Ho, Guildenstern! Bring in my lord.


        Enter Hamlet and Guildenstern [with Attendants].

  King. Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?

  Ham. At supper.
  King. At supper? Where?
  Ham. Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A c
ertain
    convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your worm is
your
    only emperor for d
iet. We fat all creatures else to fat us,
and
    we fat ourselves for maggots. Your fat king and 
your lean
beggar
    is but variable service- two dishes, but to one table. That's
the
    end.

  King. Alas, alas!
  Ham. A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and
eat
    of 
the fish that hath fed of that worm.
  King. What dost thou mean by this?
  Ham. Nothing but to sh
ow you how a king may go a progress
through
    the guts of a beggar.
  King. Where is Polonius?

  Ham. In heaven. Send thither to see. If your messenger find him
not
    there, seek him i' th' 
other place yourself. But indeed, if
you
    find him not within this month, you shall nose him as
 you go
up
    the stair, into the lobby.
  King. Go seek him there. [To Attendants.]
  Ham. He 
will stay till you come.
                                            [Exeunt Attendants.]
  King. 
Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,-
    Which we do tender as we dearly grieve
    For 
that which thou hast done,- must send thee hence
    With fiery quickness. Therefore prepare thysel
f.
    The bark is ready and the wind at help,
    Th' associates tend, and everything is bent
  
  For England.
  Ham. For England?
  King. Ay, Hamlet.
  Ham. Good.
  King. So is it, if thou kn
ew'st our purposes.
  Ham. I see a cherub that sees them. But come, for England!
    Farewell, dea
r mother.
  King. Thy loving father, Hamlet.
  Ham. My mother! Father and mother is man and wife; 
man and wife
is
    one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England!
Exit.
  King. Follow him at
 foot; tempt him with speed aboard.
    Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night.
    Away! for 
everything is seal'd and done
    That else leans on th' affair. Pray you make haste.
            
                Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]
    And, England, if my love thou hold'st at a
ught,-
    As my great power thereof may give thee sense,
    Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw an
d red
    After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
    Pays homage to us,- thou mayst not coldly s
et
    Our sovereign process, which imports at full,
    By letters congruing to that effect,
   
 The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;
    For like the hectic in my blood he rages,
    An
d thou must cure me. Till I know 'tis done,
    Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.         
    Exit.

Scene IV.
Near Elsinore.

Enter Fortinbras with his Army over the 
stage.

  For. Go, Captain, from me greet the Danish king.
    Tell him that by his license Forti
nbras
    Craves the conveyance of a promis'd march
    Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.

    If that his Majesty would aught with us,
    We shall express our duty in his eye;
    And l
et him know so.
  Capt. I will do't, my lord.
  For. Go softly on.
                              
     Exeunt [all but the Captain].

       Enter Hamlet, Rosencrantz, [Guildenstern,] and others.


  Ham. Good sir, whose powers are these?
  Capt. They are of Norway, sir.
  Ham. How purpos'd, 
sir, I pray you?
  Capt. Against some part of Poland.
  Ham. Who commands them, sir?
  Capt. The 
nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.
  Ham. Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
    Or for some 
frontier?
  Capt. Truly to speak, and with no addition,
    We go to gain a little patch of ground

    That hath in it no profit but the name.
    To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
 
   Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
    A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
  Ham. Why
, then the Polack never will defend it.
  Capt. Yes, it is already garrison'd.
  Ham. Two thousand
 souls and twenty thousand ducats
    Will not debate the question of this straw.
    This is th' 
imposthume of much wealth and peace,
    That inward breaks, and shows no cause without
    Why th
e man dies.- I humbly thank you, sir.
  Capt. God b' wi' you, sir.                             [Exi
t.]
  Ros. Will't please you go, my lord?
  Ham. I'll be with you straight. Go a little before.
 
                                       [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]
    How all occasions do inform aga
inst me
    And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
    If his chief good and market of his time

    Be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.
    Sure he that made us with such large discourse
,
    Looking before and after, gave us not
    That capability and godlike reason
    To fust in
 us unus'd. Now, whether it be
    Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple
    Of thinking too pr
ecisely on th' event,-
    A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
    And ever three
 parts coward,- I do not know
    Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do,'
    Sith I have caus
e, and will, and strength, and means
    To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me.
    Witness t
his army of such mass and charge,
    Led by a delicate and tender prince,
    Whose spirit, with 
divine ambition puff'd,
    Makes mouths at the invisible event,
    Exposing what is mortal and u
nsure
    To all that fortune, death, and danger dare,
    Even for an eggshell. Rightly to be gre
at
    Is not to stir without great argument,
    But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
    When
 honour's at the stake. How stand I then,
    That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,
    Exc
itements of my reason and my blood,
    And let all sleep, while to my shame I see
    The imminen
t death of twenty thousand men
    That for a fantasy and trick of fame
    Go to their graves lik
e beds, fight for a plot
    Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
    Which is not tomb enoug
h and continent
    To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,
    My thoughts be bloody, or be n
othing worth!            Exit.

Scene V.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Ent
er Horatio, Queen, and a Gentleman.

  Queen. I will not speak with her.
  Gent. She is importuna
te, indeed distract.
    Her mood will needs be pitied.
  Queen. What would she have?
  Gent. She
 speaks much of her father; says she hears
    There's tricks i' th' world, and hems, and beats her
 heart;
    Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,
    That carry but half sense. Her
 speech is nothing,
    Yet the unshaped use of it doth move
    The hearers to collection; they a
im at it,
    And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;
    Which, as her winks and nods a
nd gestures yield them,
    Indeed would make one think there might be thought,
    Though nothing
 sure, yet much unhappily.
  Hor. 'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew
    Dangerou
s conjectures in ill-breeding minds.
  Queen. Let her come in.
                                   
            [Exit Gentleman.]
    [Aside] To my sick soul (as sin's true nature is)
    Each toy s
eems Prologue to some great amiss.
    So full of artless jealousy is guilt
    It spills itself i
n fearing to be spilt.

                 Enter Ophelia distracted.

  Oph. Where is the beauteou
s Majesty of Denmark?
  Queen. How now, Ophelia?
  Oph. (sings)
         How should I your true-l
ove know
           From another one?
         By his cockle bat and' staff
           And his sa
ndal shoon.

  Queen. Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
  Oph. Say you? Nay, pray You mar
k.

    (Sings) He is dead and gone, lady,
              He is dead and gone;
            At his
 head a grass-green turf,
              At his heels a stone.

    O, ho!
  Queen. Nay, but Ophe
lia-
  Oph. Pray you mark.

    (Sings) White his shroud as the mountain snow-

               
     Enter King.

  Queen. Alas, look here, my lord!
  Oph. (Sings)
           Larded all with s
weet flowers;
         Which bewept to the grave did not go
           With true-love showers.


  King. How do you, pretty lady?
  Oph. Well, God dild you! They say the owl was a baker's
daughte
r.
    Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be. God
be at
    your table!
  King.
 Conceit upon her father.
  Oph. Pray let's have no words of this; but when they ask, you
what
  
  it means, say you this:

    (Sings) To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,
              All in t
he morning bedtime,
            And I a maid at your window,
              To be your Valentine.


            Then up he rose and donn'd his clo'es
              And dupp'd the chamber door,
   
         Let in the maid, that out a maid
              Never departed more.

  King. Pretty Ophe
lia!
  Oph. Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't!

    [Sings] By Gis and by Saint 
Charity,
              Alack, and fie for shame!
            Young men will do't if they come to't

              By Cock, they are to blame.

            Quoth she, 'Before you tumbled me,
     
         You promis'd me to wed.'

    He answers:

            'So would I 'a' done, by yonder 
sun,
              An thou hadst not come to my bed.'

  King. How long hath she been thus?
  Op
h. I hope all will be well. We must be patient; but I cannot
    choose but weep to think they woul
d lay him i' th' cold
ground.
    My brother shall know of it; and so I thank you for your good
 
   counsel. Come, my coach! Good night, ladies. Good night,
sweet
    ladies. Good night, good nig
ht.                         Exit
  King. Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.
      
                                           [Exit Horatio.]

    O, this is the poison of deep grie
f; it springs
    All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
    When sorrows come, they c
ome not single spies.
    But in battalions! First, her father slain;
    Next, your son gone, and
 he most violent author
    Of his own just remove; the people muddied,
    Thick and and unwholes
ome in their thoughts and whispers
    For good Polonius' death, and we have done but greenly
    
In hugger-mugger to inter him; poor Ophelia
    Divided from herself and her fair judgment,
    Wi
thout the which we are pictures or mere beasts;
    Last, and as much containing as all these,
   
 Her brother is in secret come from France;
    And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
    Feeds 
on his wonder, keep, himself in clouds,
    With pestilent speeches of his father's death,
    Whe
rein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
    Will nothing stick our person to arraign
    In ear and ea
r. O my dear Gertrude, this,
    Like to a murd'ring piece, in many places
    Give me superfluous
 death.                  A noise within.
  Queen. Alack, what noise is this?
  King. Where are my 
Switzers? Let them guard the door.

                     Enter a Messenger.

    What is the mat
ter?
  Mess. Save Yourself, my lord:
    The ocean, overpeering of his list,
    Eats not the fla
ts with more impetuous haste
    Than Young Laertes, in a riotous head,
    O'erbears Your offices
. The rabble call him lord;
    And, as the world were now but to begin,
    Antiquity forgot, cus
tom not known,
    The ratifiers and props of every word,
    They cry 'Choose we! Laertes shall b
e king!'
    Caps, hands, and tongues applaud it to the clouds,
    'Laertes shall be king! Laerte
s king!'
                                                 A noise within.
  Queen. How cheerfully 
on the false trail they cry!
    O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!
  King. The doors are 
broke.

                    Enter Laertes with others.

  Laer. Where is this king?- Sirs, staid
 you all without.
  All. No, let's come in!
  Laer. I pray you give me leave.
  All. We will, we 
will!
  Laer. I thank you. Keep the door.      [Exeunt his Followers.]
    O thou vile king,
    
Give me my father!
  Queen. Calmly, good Laertes.
  Laer. That drop of blood that's calm proclaims
 me bastard;
    Cries cuckold to my father; brands the harlot
    Even here between the chaste un
smirched brows
    Of my true mother.
  King. What is the cause, Laertes,
    That thy rebellion 
looks so giantlike?
    Let him go, Gertrude. Do not fear our person.
    There's such divinity do
th hedge a king
    That treason can but peep to what it would,
    Acts little of his will. Tell 
me, Laertes,
    Why thou art thus incens'd. Let him go, Gertrude.
    Speak, man.
  Laer. Where 
is my father?
  King. Dead.
  Queen. But not by him!
  King. Let him demand his fill.
  Laer. Ho
w came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
    To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil
   
 Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
    I dare damnation. To this point I stand,
    Th
at both the world, I give to negligence,
    Let come what comes; only I'll be reveng'd
    Most t
hroughly for my father.
  King. Who shall stay you?
  Laer. My will, not all the world!
    And f
or my means, I'll husband them so well
    They shall go far with little.
  King. Good Laertes,
 
   If you desire to know the certainty
    Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge

    That sweepstake you will draw both friend and foe,
    Winner and loser?
  Laer. None but his 
enemies.
  King. Will you know them then?
  Laer. To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms

    And, like the kind life-rend'ring pelican,
    Repast them with my blood.
  King. Why, now You
 speak
    Like a good child and a true gentleman.
    That I am guiltless of your father's death,

    And am most sensibly in grief for it,
    It shall as level to your judgment pierce
    As d
ay does to your eye.
                              A noise within: 'Let her come in.'
  Laer. How 
now? What noise is that?

                      Enter Ophelia.

    O heat, dry up my brains! Te
ars seven times salt
    Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!
    By heaven, thy madness sha
ll be paid by weight
    Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!
    Dear maid, kind sister, 
sweet Ophelia!
    O heavens! is't possible a young maid's wits
    Should be as mortal as an old 
man's life?
    Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,
    It sends some precious instance o
f itself
    After the thing it loves.

  Oph. (sings)
         They bore him barefac'd on the b
ier
           (Hey non nony, nony, hey nony)
         And in his grave rain'd many a tear.

   
 Fare you well, my dove!
  Laer. Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
    It could not
 move thus.
  Oph. You must sing 'A-down a-down, and you call him a-down-a.'
O,
    how the wheel
 becomes it! It is the false steward, that stole
his
    master's daughter.
  Laer. This nothing'
s more than matter.
  Oph. There's rosemary, that's for remembrance. Pray you, love,
    remember.
 And there is pansies, that's for thoughts.
  Laer. A document in madness! Thoughts and remembrance
 fitted.
  Oph. There's fennel for you, and columbines. There's rue for
you,
    and here's some 
for me. We may call it herb of grace o'
Sundays.
    O, you must wear your rue with a difference! 
There's a daisy.
I
    would give you some violets, but they wither'd all when my
father
    die
d. They say he made a good end.

    [Sings] For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.

  Laer. Thoug
ht and affliction, passion, hell itself,
    She turns to favour and to prettiness.
  Oph. (sings)

         And will he not come again?
         And will he not come again?
           No, no, he 
is dead;
           Go to thy deathbed;
         He never will come again.

         His beard w
as as white as snow,
         All flaxen was his poll.
           He is gone, he is gone,
       
    And we cast away moan.
         God 'a'mercy on his soul!

    And of all Christian souls, I 
pray God. God b' wi' you.
Exit.
  Laer. Do you see this, O God?
  King. Laertes, I must commune w
ith your grief,
    Or you deny me right. Go but apart,
    Make choice of whom your wisest friend
s you will,
    And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me.
    If by direct or by collateral
 hand
    They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,
    Our crown, our life, and all that we
 call ours,
    To you in satisfaction; but if not,
    Be you content to lend your patience to us
,
    And we shall jointly labour with your soul
    To give it due content.
  Laer. Let this be 
so.
    His means of death, his obscure funeral-
    No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bone
s,
    No noble rite nor formal ostentation,-
    Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,

    That I must call't in question.
  King. So you shall;
    And where th' offence is let the g
reat axe fall.
    I pray you go with me.

    letters for him. Ere we were two
 days old at sea, a pirate of

    very warlike appointment gave us chase. Finding ourselves too

    slow of sail, we put on a compelled valour, and in the
grapple I
    boarded them. On the inst
ant they got clear of our ship; so I
    alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with me like

thieves
    of mercy; but they knew what they did: I am to do a good turn
for
    them. Let the 
King have the letters I have sent, and repair
thou
    to me with as much speed as thou wouldst fl
y death. I have
words

course

Scene VII.
Elsinore. Another room in the C

  King. Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
    And 
You must put me in your heart for friend,
    Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,

t he which hath your noble father slain

  Laer. It well appears. But tell me

    Why you proceeded not against these feats
    So crimeful and so capital in nature,
    As by
 your safety, wisdom, all things else,
    You mainly were stirr'd up.
  King. O, for two special 
reasons,
    Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,
    But yet to me they are strong. Th
e Queen his mother
    Lives almost by his looks; and for myself,-
    My virtue or my plague, be 
it either which,-
    She's so conjunctive to my life and soul
    That, as the star moves not but
 in his sphere,
    I could not but by her. The other motive
    Why to a public count I might not
 go
    Is the great love the general gender bear him,
    Who, dipping all his faults in their af
fection,
    Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
    Convert his gives to graces; s
o that my arrows,
    Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,
    Would have reverted to my bow 
again,
    And not where I had aim'd them.
  Laer. And so have I a noble father lost;
    A siste
r driven into desp'rate terms,
    Whose worth, if praises may go back again,
    Stood challenger
 on mount of all the age
    For her perfections. But my revenge will come.
  King. Break not your
 sleeps for that. You must not think
    That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
    That we ca
n let our beard be shook with danger,
    And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more.
    I
 lov'd your father, and we love ourself,
    And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine-

      
           Enter a Messenger with letters.

    How now? What news?
  Mess. Letters, my lord, fro
m Hamlet:
    This to your Majesty; this to the Queen.
  King. From Hamlet? Who brought them?
  M
ess. Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not.
    They were given me by Claudio; he receiv'd the
m
    Of him that brought them.
  King. Laertes, you shall hear them.
    Leave us.
            
                                     Exit Messenger.
    [Reads]'High and Mighty,-You shall know I 
am set naked on
your
    kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes;
    when I
 shall (first asking your pardon thereunto) recount the
    occasion of my sudden and more strange 
return.
                                                     'HAMLET.'
    What should this mean? 
Are all the rest come back?
    Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?
  Laer. Know you the hand?

  King. 'Tis Hamlet's character. 'Naked!'
    And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'
    Can
 you advise me?
  Laer. I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come!
    It warms the very sickness
 in my heart
    That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,
    'Thus didest thou.'
  King. If 
it be so, Laertes
    (As how should it be so? how otherwise?),
    Will you be rul'd by me?
  La
er. Ay my lord,
    So you will not o'errule me to a peace.
  King. To thine own peace. If he be n
ow return'd
    As checking at his voyage, and that he means
    No more to undertake it, I will w
ork him
    To exploit now ripe in my device,
    Under the which he shall not choose but fall;
 
   And for his death no wind shall breathe
    But even his mother shall uncharge the practice
   
 And call it accident.
  Laer. My lord, I will be rul'd;
    The rather, if you could devise it so

    That I might be the organ.
  King. It falls right.
    You have been talk'd of since your tr
avel much,
    And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality
    Wherein they say you shine, Your su
m of parts
    Did not together pluck such envy from him
    As did that one; and that, in my rega
rd,
    Of the unworthiest siege.
  Laer. What part is that, my lord?
  King. A very riband in th
e cap of youth-
    Yet needfull too; for youth no less becomes
    The light and careless livery 
that it wears
    Than settled age his sables and his weeds,
    Importing health and graveness. T
wo months since
    Here was a gentleman of Normandy.
    I have seen myself, and serv'd against, 
the French,
    And they can well on horseback; but this gallant
    Had witchcraft in't. He grew 
unto his seat,
    And to such wondrous doing brought his horse
    As had he been incorps'd and d
emi-natur'd
    With the brave beast. So far he topp'd my thought
    That I, in forgery of shapes
 and tricks,
    Come short of what he did.
  Laer. A Norman was't?
  King. A Norman.
  Laer. Up
on my life, Lamound.
  King. The very same.
  Laer. I know him well. He is the broach indeed
    
And gem of all the nation.
  King. He made confession of you;
    And gave you such a masterly rep
ort
    For art and exercise in your defence,
    And for your rapier most especially,
    That h
e cried out 'twould be a sight indeed
    If one could match you. The scrimers of their nation
   
 He swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
    If you oppos'd them. Sir, this report of his
   
 Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
    That he could nothing do but wish and beg
    Your sudden
 coming o'er to play with you.
    Now, out of this-
  Laer. What out of this, my lord?
  King. L
aertes, was your father dear to you?
    Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
    A face with
out a heart,'
  Laer. Why ask you this?
  King. Not that I think you did not love your father;
  
  But that I know love is begun by time,
    And that I see, in passages of proof,
    Time qualif
ies the spark and fire of it.
    There lives within the very flame of love
    A kind of wick or 
snuff that will abate it;
    And nothing is at a like goodness still;
    For goodness, growing t
o a plurisy,
    Dies in his own too-much. That we would do,
    We should do when we would; for t
his 'would' changes,
    And hath abatements and delays as many
    As there are tongues, are hand
s, are accidents;
    And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
    That hurts by easing.
 But to the quick o' th' ulcer!
    Hamlet comes back. What would you undertake
    To show yourse
lf your father's son in deed
    More than in words?
  Laer. To cut his throat i' th' church!
  K
ing. No place indeed should murther sanctuarize;
    Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laert
es,
    Will you do this? Keep close within your chamber.
    Hamlet return'd shall know you are c
ome home.
    We'll put on those shall praise your excellence
    And set a double varnish on the 
fame
    The Frenchman gave you; bring you in fine together
    And wager on your heads. He, being
 remiss,
    Most generous, and free from all contriving,
    Will not peruse the foils; so that w
ith ease,
    Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
    A sword unbated, and, in a pass of pr
actice,
    Requite him for your father.
  Laer. I will do't!
    And for that purpose I'll anoin
t my sword.
    I bought an unction of a mountebank,
    So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
 
   Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
    Collected from all simples that have virtue
    
Under the moon, can save the thing from death
    This is but scratch'd withal. I'll touch my point

    With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
    It may be death.
  King. Let's furthe
r think of this,
    Weigh what convenience both of time and means
    May fit us to our shape. If
 this should fall,
    And that our drift look through our bad performance.
    'Twere better not 
assay'd. Therefore this project
    Should have a back or second, that might hold
    If this did 
blast in proof. Soft! let me see.
    We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings-
    I ha't!
   
 When in your motion you are hot and dry-
    As make your bouts more violent to that end-
    And
 that he calls for drink, I'll have prepar'd him
    A chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,

    If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
    Our purpose may hold there.- But stay, what noi
se,

                           Enter Queen.

    How now, sweet queen?
  Queen. One woe doth t
read upon another's heel,
    So fast they follow. Your sister's drown'd, Laertes.
  Laer. Drown'd
! O, where?
  Queen. There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
    That shows his hoar leaves in the
 glassy stream.
    There with fantastic garlands did she come
    Of crowflowers, nettles, daisie
s, and long purples,
    That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
    But our cold maids do dea
d men's fingers call them.
    There on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds
    Clamb'ring to han
g, an envious sliver broke,
    When down her weedy trophies and herself
    Fell in the weeping b
rook. Her clothes spread wide
    And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up;
    Which time she c
haunted snatches of old tunes,
    As one incapable of her own distress,
    Or like a creature na
tive and indued
    Unto that element; but long it could not be
    Till that her garments, heavy 
with their drink,
    Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay
    To muddy death.
  Laer. A
las, then she is drown'd?
  Queen. Drown'd, drown'd.
  Laer. Too much of water hast thou, poor Oph
elia,
    And therefore I forbid my tears; but yet
    It is our trick; nature her custom holds,

    Let shame say what it will. When these are gone,
    The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord.
  
  I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze
    But that this folly douts it.                 
         Exit.
  King. Let's follow, Gertrude.
    How much I had to do to calm his rage I
    No
w fear I this will give it start again;
    Therefore let's follow.
                              
                           Exeunt.

ACT V. Scene I.
Elsinore. A churchyard.


Enter two Clowns, [with spades and pickaxes].

  Clown. Is she to be buried in Christian burial wh
en she
wilfully
    seeks her own salvation?
  Other. I tell thee she is; therefore make her grav
e straight.
    The crowner hath sate on her, and finds it Christian burial.
  Clown. How can that
 be, unless she drown'd herself in her own
    defence?
  Other. Why, 'tis found so.
  Clown. It 
must be se offendendo; it cannot be else. For here
lies
    the point: if I drown myself wittingly
, it argues an act; and
an
    act hath three branches-it is to act, to do, and to perform;
    a
rgal, she drown'd herself wittingly.
  Other. Nay, but hear you, Goodman Delver!
  Clown. Give me 
leave. Here lies the water; good. Here stands
the
    man; good. If the man go to this water and d
rown himself, it
is,
    will he nill he, he goes- mark you that. But if the water
come to
    h
im and drown him, he drowns not himself. Argal, he that is
not
    guilty of his own death shorten
s not his own life.
  Other. But is this law?
  Clown. Ay, marry, is't- crowner's quest law.
  Ot
her. Will you ha' the truth an't? If this had not been a
    gentlewoman, she should have been buri
ed out o' Christian
burial.
  Clown. Why, there thou say'st! And the more pity that great
folk
 
   should have count'nance in this world to drown or hang
themselves
    more than their even-Chri
stian. Come, my spade! There is no
    ancient gentlemen but gard'ners, ditchers, and grave-makers.

They
    hold up Adam's profession.
  Other. Was he a gentleman?
  Clown. 'A was the first that
 ever bore arms.
  Other. Why, he had none.
  Clown. What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand
 the
Scripture?
    The Scripture says Adam digg'd. Could he dig without arms?
I'll
    put anot
her question to thee. If thou answerest me not to the
    purpose, confess thyself-
  Other. Go to
!
  Clown. What is he that builds stronger than either the mason,
the
    shipwright, or the carp
enter?
  Other. The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand
    tenants.
  Clown. I lik
e thy wit well, in good faith. The gallows does
well.
    But how does it well? It does well to th
ose that do ill. Now,
    thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the
    church. 
Argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To't again,
come!
  Other. Who builds stronger than a maso
n, a shipwright, or a
    carpenter?
  Clown. Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
  Other. Marry, now I
 can tell!
  Clown. To't.
  Other. Mass, I cannot tell.

                 Enter Hamlet and Horat
io afar off.

  Clown. Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull ass
will
    not mend h
is pace with beating; and when you are ask'd this
    question next, say 'a grave-maker.' The house
s he makes lasts
    till doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan; fetch me a stoup of
    liquor.
    
                                        [Exit Second Clown.]


                       [Clown digs
 and] sings.

       In youth when I did love, did love,
         Methought it was very sweet;
 
      To contract- O- the time for- a- my behove,
         O, methought there- a- was nothing- a- m
eet.

  Ham. Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings
at
    grave-making?
  H
or. Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.
  Ham. 'Tis e'en so. The hand of little empl
oyment hath the
daintier
    sense.
  Clown. (sings)
         But age with his stealing steps
 
          Hath clawed me in his clutch,
         And hath shipped me intil the land,
           As
 if I had never been such.
                                            [Throws up a skull.]

  Ha
m. That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once. How
the
    knave jowls it to the ground,as
 if 'twere Cain's jawbone,
that
    did the first murther! This might be the pate of a
Politician
,
    which this ass now o'erreaches; one that would circumvent
God,
    might it not?
  Hor. It
 might, my lord.
  Ham. Or of a courtier, which could say 'Good morrow, sweet
lord!
    How dost 
thou, good lord?' This might be my Lord Such-a-one,
that
    prais'd my Lord Such-a-one's horse wh
en he meant to beg it-
might
    it not?
  Hor. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Why, e'en so! and now my Lad
y Worm's, chapless, and
knock'd
    about the mazzard with a sexton's spade. Here's fine
revoluti
on,
    and we had the trick to see't. Did these bones cost no more
the
    breeding but to play 
at loggets with 'em? Mine ache to think
    on't.
  Clown. (Sings)
         A pickaxe and a spade
, a spade,
           For and a shrouding sheet;
         O, a Pit of clay for to be made
       
    For such a guest is meet.
                                      Throws up [another skull].

 
 Ham. There's another. Why may not that be the skull of a
lawyer?
    Where be his quiddits now, h
is quillets, his cases, his
tenures,
    and his tricks? Why does he suffer this rude knave now to

knock
    him about the sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell
him
    of his action of 
battery? Hum! This fellow might be in's time
a
    great buyer of land, with his statutes, his rec
ognizances,
his
    fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries. Is this the fine
of
    his fine
s, and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his
fine
    pate full of fine dirt? Will his vouch
ers vouch him no more
of
    his purchases, and double ones too, than the length and
breadth
   
 of a pair of indentures? The very conveyances of his lands
will
    scarcely lie in this box; and
 must th' inheritor himself have
no
    more, ha?
  Hor. Not a jot more, my lord.
  Ham. Is not 
parchment made of sheepskins?
  Hor. Ay, my lord, And of calveskins too.
  Ham. They are sheep and
 calves which seek out assurance in
that. I
    will speak to this fellow. Whose grave's this, sir
rah?
  Clown. Mine, sir.

    [Sings] O, a pit of clay for to be made
              For such a g
uest is meet.

  Ham. I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in't.
  Clown. You lie out on't,
 sir, and therefore 'tis not yours.
    For my part, I do not lie in't, yet it is mine.
  Ham. Tho
u dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine. 'Tis
for
    the dead, not for the quick; therefo
re thou liest.
  Clown. 'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away again from me to you.
  Ham. What man d
ost thou dig it for?
  Clown. For no man, sir.
  Ham. What woman then?
  Clown. For none neither.

  Ham. Who is to be buried in't?
  Clown. One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's
d
ead.
  Ham. How absolute the knave is! We must speak by the card, or
    equivocation will undo us
. By the Lord, Horatio, this three
years
    I have taken note of it, the age is grown so picked t
hat the
toe
    of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he
galls
    his kibe.- Ho
w long hast thou been a grave-maker?
  Clown. Of all the days i' th' year, I came to't that day tha
t
our
    last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.
  Ham. How long is that since?
  Clown. Cannot y
ou tell that? Every fool can tell that. It was
the
    very day that young Hamlet was born- he tha
t is mad, and sent
    into England.
  Ham. Ay, marry, why was be sent into England?
  Clown. Why
, because 'a was mad. 'A shall recover his wits
there;
    or, if 'a do not, 'tis no great matter 
there.
  Ham. Why?
  Clown. 'Twill not he seen in him there. There the men are as
mad as
    he.

  Ham. How came he mad?
  Clown. Very strangely, they say.
  Ham. How strangely?
  Clown. Faith
, e'en with losing his wits.
  Ham. Upon what ground?
  Clown. Why, here in Denmark. I have been s
exton here, man and
boy
    thirty years.
  Ham. How long will a man lie i' th' earth ere he rot?

  Clown. Faith, if 'a be not rotten before 'a die (as we have
many
    pocky corses now-a-days t
hat will scarce hold the laying in,
I
    will last you some eight year or nine year. A tanner wil
l
last
    you nine year.
  Ham. Why he more than another?
  Clown. Why, sir, his hide is so tan
n'd with his trade that 'a
will
    keep out water a great while; and your water is a sore
decaye
r of
    your whoreson dead body. Here's a skull now. This skull hath
lien
    you i' th' earth t
hree-and-twenty years.
  Ham. Whose was it?
  Clown. A whoreson, mad fellow's it was. Whose do you
 think it
was?
  Ham. Nay, I know not.
  Clown. A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! 'A pour'd a 
flagon
of
    Rhenish on my head once. This same skull, sir, was Yorick's
    skull, the King's j
ester.
  Ham. This?
  Clown. E'en that.
  Ham. Let me see. [Takes the skull.] Alas, poor Yorick! 
I knew
him,
    Horatio. A fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy.
He
    hath borne m
e on his back a thousand times. And now how
abhorred
    in my imagination it is! My gorge rises a
t it. Here hung
those
    lips that I have kiss'd I know not how oft. Where be your
gibes
    no
w? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment that
    were wont to set the table on a roa
r? Not one now, to mock
your
    own grinning? Quite chap- fall'n? Now get you to my lady's
    c
hamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this
    favour she must come. Make her laugh
 at that. Prithee,
Horatio,
    tell me one thing.
  Hor. What's that, my lord?
  Ham. Dost thou
 think Alexander look'd o' this fashion i' th'
earth?
  Hor. E'en so.
  Ham. And smelt so? Pah!

                                          [Puts down the skull.]
  Hor. E'en so, my lord.
  Ham. T
o what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not
    imagination trace the noble dust of Alexan
der till he find it
    stopping a bunghole?
  Hor. 'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider 
so.
  Ham. No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with
modesty
    enough, and likelihoo
d to lead it; as thus: Alexander died,
    Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the
 dust
is
    earth; of earth we make loam; and why of that loam (whereto
he
    was converted) m
ight they not stop a beer barrel?
    Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
    Might stop a 
hole to keep the wind away.
    O, that that earth which kept the world in awe
    Should patch a 
wall t' expel the winter's flaw!
    But soft! but soft! aside! Here comes the King-

    Enter [
priests with] a coffin [in funeral procession], King,
             Queen, Laertes, with Lords atten
dant.]

    The Queen, the courtiers. Who is this they follow?
    And with such maimed rites? Th
is doth betoken
    The corse they follow did with desp'rate hand
    Fordo it own life. 'Twas of 
some estate.
    Couch we awhile, and mark.

 Horatio.]

  Laer. What ceremony else?
  Ham. That is Laertes,
    A very noble youth. Mark.
 
 Laer. What ceremony else?
  Priest. Her obsequies have been as far enlarg'd
    As we have warran
ty. Her death was doubtful;
    And, but that great command o'ersways the order,
    She should in
 ground unsanctified have lodg'd
    Till the last trumpet. For charitable prayers,
    Shards, fl
ints, and pebbles should be thrown on her.
    Yet here she is allow'd her virgin rites,
    Her m
aiden strewments, and the bringing home
    Of bell and burial.
  Laer. Must there no more be done
?
  Priest. No more be done.
    We should profane the service of the dead
    To sing a requiem 
and such rest to her
    As to peace-parted souls.
  Laer. Lay her i' th' earth;
    And from her
 fair and unpolluted flesh
    May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,
    A minist'ring
 angel shall my sister be
    When thou liest howling.
  Ham. What, the fair Ophelia?
  Queen. Sw
eets to the sweet! Farewell.
                                             [Scatters flowers.]
    
I hop'd thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
    I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet
 maid,
    And not have strew'd thy grave.
  Laer. O, treble woe
    Fall ten times treble on tha
t cursed head
    Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
    Depriv'd thee of! Hold off the ea
rth awhile,
    Till I have caught her once more in mine arms.
                                   
          Leaps in the grave.
    Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead
    Till of this flat
 a mountain you have made
    T' o'ertop old Pelion or the skyish head
    Of blue Olympus.
  Ham
. [comes forward] What is he whose grief
    Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow
    Co
njures the wand'ring stars, and makes them stand
    Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,
    H
amlet the Dane.                    [Leaps in after Laertes.
  Laer. The devil take thy soul!
     
                                       [Grapples with him].
  Ham. Thou pray'st not well.
    I pr
ithee take thy fingers from my throat;
    For, though I am not splenitive and rash,
    Yet have 
I in me something dangerous,
    Which let thy wisdom fear. Hold off thy hand!
  King. Pluck them 
asunder.
  Queen. Hamlet, Hamlet!
  All. Gentlemen!
  Hor. Good my lord, be quiet.
             
[The Attendants part them, and they come out of the
                                               
          grave.]
  Ham. Why, I will fight with him upon this theme
    Until my eyelids will no l
onger wag.
  Queen. O my son, what theme?
  Ham. I lov'd Ophelia. Forty thousand brothers
    Cou
ld not (with all their quantity of love)
    Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?
  King. O,
 he is mad, Laertes.
  Queen. For love of God, forbear him!
  Ham. 'Swounds, show me what thou't d
o.
    Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?
    Woo't drink up esill? eat a cr
ocodile?
    I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?
    To outface me with leaping in her grave?

    Be buried quick with her, and so will I.
    And if thou prate of mountains, let them throw

    Millions of acres on us, till our ground,
    Singeing his pate against the burning zone,
    
Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
    I'll rant as well as thou.
  Queen. This is mere
 madness;
    And thus a while the fit will work on him.
    Anon, as patient as the female dove

    When that her golden couplets are disclos'd,
    His silence will sit drooping.
  Ham. Hear yo
u, sir!
    What is the reason that you use me thus?
    I lov'd you ever. But it is no matter.
 
   Let Hercules himself do what he may,
    The cat will mew, and dog will have his day.
Exit.
  
King. I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.
                                                   
Exit Horatio.
    [To Laertes] Strengthen your patience in our last night's
speech.
    We'll put
 the matter to the present push.-
    Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.-
    This grave
 shall have a living monument.
    An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;

e our proceeding be.

Scen
e II.
Elsinore. A hall in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet and Horatio.

  Ham. So much for this, sir;
 now shall you see the other.
    You do remember all the circumstance?
  Hor. Remember it, my lor
d!
  Ham. Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting
    That would not let me sleep. Methought
 I lay
    Worse than the mutinies in the bilboes. Rashly-
    And prais'd be rashness for it; let
 us know,
    Our indiscretion sometime serves us well
    When our deep plots do pall; and that s
hould learn us
    There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
    Rough-hew them how we will-
  Hor
. That is most certain.
  Ham. Up from my cabin,
    My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
  
  Grop'd I to find out them; had my desire,
    Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew
    To
 mine own room again; making so bold
    (My fears forgetting manners) to unseal
    Their grand c
ommission; where I found, Horatio
    (O royal knavery!), an exact command,
    Larded with many s
everal sorts of reasons,
    Importing Denmark's health, and England's too,
    With, hoo! such bu
gs and goblins in my life-
    That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
    No, not to stay the f
inding of the axe,
    My head should be struck off.
  Hor. Is't possible?
  Ham. Here's the comm
ission; read it at more leisure.
    But wilt thou bear me how I did proceed?
  Hor. I beseech you
.
  Ham. Being thus benetted round with villanies,
    Or I could make a prologue to my brains,
 
   They had begun the play. I sat me down;
    Devis'd a new commission; wrote it fair.
    I once
 did hold it, as our statists do,
    A baseness to write fair, and labour'd much
    How to forge
t that learning; but, sir, now
    It did me yeoman's service. Wilt thou know
    Th' effect of wh
at I wrote?
  Hor. Ay, good my lord.
  Ham. An earnest conjuration from the King,
    As England 
was his faithful tributary,
    As love between them like the palm might flourish,
    As peace sh
ould still her wheaten garland wear
    And stand a comma 'tween their amities,
    And many such-
like as's of great charge,
    That, on the view and knowing of these contents,
    Without debate
ment further, more or less,
    He should the bearers put to sudden death,
    Not shriving time a
llow'd.
  Hor. How was this seal'd?
  Ham. Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
    I had my fa
ther's signet in my purse,
    Which was the model of that Danish seal;
    Folded the writ up in 
the form of th' other,
    Subscrib'd it, gave't th' impression, plac'd it safely,
    The changel
ing never known. Now, the next day
    Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent
    Thou kn
ow'st already.
  Hor. So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.
  Ham. Why, man, they did make love
 to this employment!
    They are not near my conscience; their defeat
    Does by their own insin
uation grow.
    'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
    Between the pass and fell incensed
 points
    Of mighty opposites.
  Hor. Why, what a king is this!
  Ham. Does it not, thinks't th
ee, stand me now upon-
    He that hath kill'd my king, and whor'd my mother;
    Popp'd in betwee
n th' election and my hopes;
    Thrown out his angle for my proper life,
    And with such coz'na
ge- is't not perfect conscience
    To quit him with this arm? And is't not to be damn'd
    To le
t this canker of our nature come
    In further evil?
  Hor. It must be shortly known to him from 
England
    What is the issue of the business there.
  Ham. It will be short; the interim is mine,

    And a man's life is no more than to say 'one.'
    But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
    Th
at to Laertes I forgot myself,
    For by the image of my cause I see
    The portraiture of his. 
I'll court his favours.
    But sure the bravery of his grief did put me
    Into a tow'ring passi
on.
  Hor. Peace! Who comes here?

                 Enter young Osric, a courtier.

  Osr. Your
 lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
  Ham. I humbly thank you, sir. [Aside to Horatio] Dost
 know this
    waterfly?
  Hor. [aside to Hamlet] No, my good lord.
  Ham. [aside to Horatio] Thy
 state is the more gracious; for
'tis a
    vice to know him. He hath much land, and fertile. Let 
a beast
be
    lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at the king's mess.
'Tis
    a chough; b
ut, as I say, spacious in the possession of dirt.

  Osr. Sweet lord, if your lordship were at lei
sure, I should
impart
    a thing to you from his Majesty.
  Ham. I will receive it, sir, with al
l diligence of spirit. Put
your
    bonnet to his right use. 'Tis for the head.
  Osr. I thank yo
ur lordship, it is very hot.
  Ham. No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly.
  Osr. 
It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
  Ham. But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my

complexion.
  Osr. Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry, as 'twere- I
cannot
    tell how. But
, my lord, his Majesty bade me signify to you
that
    he has laid a great wager on your head. Sir
, this is the
matter-
  Ham. I beseech you remember.
                           [Hamlet moves him
 to put on his hat.]
  Osr. Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here
is
    new
ly come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute
gentleman,
    full of most excellent difference
s, of very soft society and
    great showing. Indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the
card

    or calendar of gentry; for you shall find in him the
continent of
    what part a gentleman wo
uld see.
  Ham. Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you; though, I

    know, to divide h
im inventorially would dozy th' arithmetic
of
    memory, and yet but yaw neither in respect of hi
s quick sail.
    But, in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of
great
    article, 
and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as, to
make
    true diction of him, his semblable is
 his mirror, and who
else
    would trace him, his umbrage, nothing more.
  Osr. Your lordship sp
eaks most infallibly of him.
  Ham. The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our
more

    rawer breath?
  Osr. Sir?
  Hor [aside to Hamlet] Is't not possible to understand in
anothe
r
    tongue? You will do't, sir, really.
  Ham. What imports the nomination of this gentleman?
 
 Osr. Of Laertes?
  Hor. [aside] His purse is empty already. All's golden words are
    spent.
  
Ham. Of him, sir.
  Osr. I know you are not ignorant-
  Ham. I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, 
if you did, it would
not
    much approve me. Well, sir?
  Osr. You are not ignorant of what exce
llence Laertes is-
  Ham. I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in
    excellenc
e; but to know a man well were to know himself.
  Osr. I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the impu
tation laid on
him
    by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.
  Ham. What's his weapon?
  Osr. Ra
pier and dagger.
  Ham. That's two of his weapons- but well.
  Osr. The King, sir, hath wager'd wi
th him six Barbary horses;
    against the which he has impon'd, as I take it, six French
    rapi
ers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers,
and
    so. Three of the carriages, in f
aith, are very dear to fancy,
    very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of
  
  very liberal conceit.
  Ham. What call you the carriages?
  Hor. [aside to Hamlet] I knew you mu
st be edified by the
margent
    ere you had done.
  Osr. The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
 
 Ham. The phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could
    carry cannon by our sides. I w
ould it might be hangers till
then.
    But on! Six Barbary horses against six French swords, thei
r
    assigns, and three liberal-conceited carriages: that's the
French
    bet against the Danis
h. Why is this all impon'd, as you call
it?
  Osr. The King, sir, hath laid that, in a dozen passe
s between
    yourself and him, he shall not exceed you three hits; he hath
    laid on twelve for
 nine, and it would come to immediate trial
    if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.
  Ham
. How if I answer no?
  Osr. I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
  Ham. Sir, 
I will walk here in the hall. If it please his
Majesty,
    it is the breathing time of day with m
e. Let the foils be
    brought, the gentleman willing, and the King hold his
purpose,
    I will
 win for him if I can; if not, I will gain nothing but
my
    shame and the odd hits.
  Osr. Shal
l I redeliver you e'en so?
  Ham. To this effect, sir, after what flourish your nature will.
  Osr
. I commend my duty to your lordship.
  Ham. Yours, yours. [Exit Osric.] He does well to commend it

    himself; there are no tongues else for's turn.
  Hor. This lapwing runs away with the shell o
n his head.
  Ham. He did comply with his dug before he suck'd it. Thus has
he,
    and many more
 of the same bevy that I know the drossy age
dotes
    on, only got the tune of the time and outwa
rd habit of
encounter-
    a kind of yesty collection, which carries them through and
    through
 the most fann'd and winnowed opinions; and do but
blow
    them to their trial-the bubbles are ou
t,

                            Enter a Lord.

  Lord. My lord, his Majesty commended him to you
 by young Osric,
who
    brings back to him, that you attend him in the hall. He sends
to
    kn
ow if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you
will
    take longer time.
  Ham. I am
 constant to my purposes; they follow the King's
pleasure.
    If his fitness speaks, mine is read
y; now or whensoever,
provided
    I be so able as now.
  Lord. The King and Queen and all are co
ming down.
  Ham. In happy time.
  Lord. The Queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to

    Laertes before you fall to play.
  Ham. She well instructs me.
                             
                       [Exit Lord.]
  Hor. You will lose this wager, my lord.
  Ham. I do not thin
k so. Since he went into France I have been
in
    continual practice. I shall win at the odds. Bu
t thou wouldst
not
    think how ill all's here about my heart. But it is no matter.
  Hor. Nay, 
good my lord -
  Ham. It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gaingiving as
    would perhaps 
trouble a woman.
  Hor. If your mind dislike anything, obey it. I will forestall
their
    repair
 hither and say you are not fit.
  Ham. Not a whit, we defy augury; there's a special providence
i
n
    the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not to come; if it
be
    not to come, it will be
 now; if it be not now, yet it will
come:
    the readiness is all. Since no man knows aught of wh
at he
leaves,
    what is't to leave betimes? Let be.

    Enter King, Queen, Laertes, Osric, an
d Lords, with other
              Attendants with foils and gauntlets.
               A table and 
flagons of wine on it.

  King. Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
                 
   [The King puts Laertes' hand into Hamlet's.]
  Ham. Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wr
ong;
    But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.
    This presence knows,
    And you must needs ha
ve heard, how I am punish'd
    With sore distraction. What I have done
    That might your nature
, honour, and exception
    Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
    Was't Hamlet wrong'd L
aertes? Never Hamlet.
    If Hamlet from himself be taken away,
    And when he's not himself does
 wrong Laertes,
    Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
    Who does it, then? His madness.
 If't be so,
    Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
    His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.

    Sir, in this audience,
    Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd evil
    Free me so far in you
r most generous thoughts
    That I have shot my arrow o'er the house
    And hurt my brother.
  
Laer. I am satisfied in nature,
    Whose motive in this case should stir me most
    To my reveng
e. But in my terms of honour
    I stand aloof, and will no reconcilement
    Till by some elder m
asters of known honour
    I have a voice and precedent of peace
    To keep my name ungor'd. But 
till that time
    I do receive your offer'd love like love,
    And will not wrong it.
  Ham. I 
embrace it freely,
    And will this brother's wager frankly play.
    Give us the foils. Come on.

  Laer. Come, one for me.
  Ham. I'll be your foil, Laertes. In mine ignorance
    Your skill sh
all, like a star i' th' darkest night,
    Stick fiery off indeed.
  Laer. You mock me, sir.
  Ha
m. No, by this hand.
  King. Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
    You know the wag
er?
  Ham. Very well, my lord.
    Your Grace has laid the odds o' th' weaker side.
  King. I do 
not fear it, I have seen you both;
    But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.
  Laer. T
his is too heavy; let me see another.
  Ham. This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
  
                                              Prepare to play.
  Osr. Ay, my good lord.
  King. Se
t me the stoups of wine upon that table.
    If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
    Or quit i
n answer of the third exchange,
    Let all the battlements their ordnance fire;
    The King shal
l drink to Hamlet's better breath,
    And in the cup an union shall he throw
    Richer than that
 which four successive kings
    In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;
    And let the k
ettle to the trumpet speak,
    The trumpet to the cannoneer without,
    The cannons to the heave
ns, the heaven to earth,
    'Now the King drinks to Hamlet.' Come, begin.
    And you the judges,
 bear a wary eye.
  Ham. Come on, sir.
  Laer. Come, my lord.                                They 
play.
  Ham. One.
  Laer. No.
  Ham. Judgment!
  Osr. A hit, a very palpable hit.
  Laer. Well,
 again!
  King. Stay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
    Here's to thy health.
     
          [Drum; trumpets sound; a piece goes off [within].
    Give him the cup.
  Ham. I'll play
 this bout first; set it by awhile.
    Come. (They play.) Another hit. What say you?
  Laer. A to
uch, a touch; I do confess't.
  King. Our son shall win.
  Queen. He's fat, and scant of breath.

    Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows.
    The Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
  
Ham. Good madam!
  King. Gertrude, do not drink.
  Queen. I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.  
        Drinks.
  King. [aside] It is the poison'd cup; it is too late.
  Ham. I dare not drink ye
t, madam; by-and-by.
  Queen. Come, let me wipe thy face.
  Laer. My lord, I'll hit him now.
  Ki
ng. I do not think't.
  Laer. [aside] And yet it is almost against my conscience.
  Ham. Come for 
the third, Laertes! You but dally.
    Pray you pass with your best violence;
    I am afeard you 
make a wanton of me.
  Laer. Say you so? Come on.                               Play.
  Osr. Nothi
ng neither way.
  Laer. Have at you now!
                [Laertes wounds Hamlet; then] in scufflin
g, they
                    change rapiers, [and Hamlet wounds Laertes].
  King. Part them! They a
re incens'd.
  Ham. Nay come! again!                         The Queen falls.

  Osr. Look to the
 Queen there, ho!
  Hor. They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?
  Osr. How is't, Laertes?

  Laer. Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric.
    I am justly kill'd with mine own treache
ry.
  Ham. How does the Queen?
  King. She sounds to see them bleed.
  Queen. No, no! the drink, 
the drink! O my dear Hamlet!
    The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.                 [Dies.]
  Ha
m. O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd.
    Treachery! Seek it out.
                            
                    [Laertes falls.]
  Laer. It is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain;
    No me
dicine in the world can do thee good.
    In thee there is not half an hour of life.
    The treac
herous instrument is in thy hand,
    Unbated and envenom'd. The foul practice
    Hath turn'd its
elf on me. Lo, here I lie,
    Never to rise again. Thy mother's poison'd.
    I can no more. The 
King, the King's to blame.
  Ham. The point envenom'd too?
    Then, venom, to thy work.          
          Hurts the King.
  All. Treason! treason!
  King. O, yet defend me, friends! I am but hur
t.
  Ham. Here, thou incestuous, murd'rous, damned Dane,
    Drink off this potion! Is thy union h
ere?
    Follow my mother.                                 King dies.
  Laer. He is justly serv'd.

    It is a poison temper'd by himself.
    Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet.
    Mine
 and my father's death come not upon thee,
    Nor thine on me!                                    
   Dies.
  Ham. Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.
    I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen
, adieu!
    You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
    That are but mutes or audience to 
this act,
    Had I but time (as this fell sergeant, Death,
    Is strict in his arrest) O, I coul
d tell you-
    But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;
    Thou liv'st; report me and my cause aright

    To the unsatisfied.
  Hor. Never believe it.
    I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.
   
 Here's yet some liquor left.
  Ham. As th'art a man,
    Give me the cup. Let go! By heaven, I'll
 ha't.
    O good Horatio, what a wounded name
    (Things standing thus unknown) shall live behin
d me!
    If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,
    Absent thee from felicity awhile,
    And 
in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
    To tell my story.         [March afar off, and sho
t within.]
    What warlike noise is this?
  Osr. Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland
,
    To the ambassadors of England gives
    This warlike volley.
  Ham. O, I die, Horatio!
   
 The potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit.
    I cannot live to hear the news from England,
   
 But I do prophesy th' election lights
    On Fortinbras. He has my dying voice.
    So tell him, 
with th' occurrents, more and less,
    Which have solicited- the rest is silence.             Dies
.
  Hor. Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince,
    And flights of angels sing thee t
o thy rest!
                                                 [March within.]
    Why does the drum
 come hither?

    Enter Fortinbras and English Ambassadors, with Drum,
                  Colours
, and Attendants.

  Fort. Where is this sight?
  Hor. What is it you will see?
    If aught of 
woe or wonder, cease your search.
  Fort. This quarry cries on havoc. O proud Death,
    What feas
t is toward in thine eternal cell
    That thou so many princes at a shot
    So bloodily hast str
uck.
  Ambassador. The sight is dismal;
    And our affairs from England come too late.
    The e
ars are senseless that should give us hearing
    To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd
    Tha
t Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.
    Where should we have our thanks?
  Hor. Not from his 
mouth,
    Had it th' ability of life to thank you.
    He never gave commandment for their death.

    But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
    You from the Polack wars, and you from Engl
and,
    Are here arriv'd, give order that these bodies
    High on a stage be placed to the view;

    And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
    How these things came about. So shall you hea
r
    Of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts;
    Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters;
    O
f deaths put on by cunning and forc'd cause;
    And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
    Fall'n 
on th' inventors' heads. All this can I
    Truly deliver.
  Fort. Let us haste to hear it,
    A
nd call the noblest to the audience.
    For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.
    I have some
 rights of memory in this kingdom
    Which now, to claim my vantage doth invite me.
  Hor. Of tha
t I shall have also cause to speak,
    And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more.
    But 
let this same be presently perform'd,
    Even while men's minds are wild, lest more mischance
   
 On plots and errors happen.
  Fort. Let four captains
    Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage
;
    For he was likely, had he been put on,
    To have prov'd most royally; and for his passage

    The soldiers' music and the rites of war
    Speak loudly for him.
    Take up the bodies. Su
ch a sight as this
    Becomes the field but here shows much amiss.
    Go, bid the soldiers shoot
.
            Exeunt marching; after the which a peal of ordnance
                                
                   are shot off.

ACT I. Sce
ne I.
Elsinore. A platform before the Castle.

Enter two Sentinels-[first,] Francisco, [who paces
 up and down
at his post; then] Bernardo, [who approaches him].

  Ber. Who's there?
  Fran. Nay
, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.
  Ber. Long live the King!
  Fran. Bernardo?
  Ber. He.

  Fran. You come most carefully upon your hour.
  Ber. 'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Fra
ncisco.
  Fran. For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold,
    And I am sick at heart.
  Ber.
 Have you had quiet guard?
  Fran. Not a mouse stirring.
  Ber. Well, good night.
    If you do m
eet Horatio and Marcellus,
    The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.

                    
Enter Horatio and Marcellus.

  Fran. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?
  Hor. Friend
s to this ground.
  Mar. And liegemen to the Dane.
  Fran. Give you good night.
  Mar. O, farewel
l, honest soldier.
    Who hath reliev'd you?
  Fran. Bernardo hath my place.
    Give you good n
ight.                                   Exit.
  Mar. Holla, Bernardo!
  Ber. Say-
    What, is Ho
ratio there ?
  Hor. A piece of him.
  Ber. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.
  Mar. Wha
t, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
  Ber. I have seen nothing.
  Mar. Horatio says 'tis bu
t our fantasy,
    And will not let belief take hold of him
    Touching this dreaded sight, twice
 seen of us.
    Therefore I have entreated him along,
    With us to watch the minutes of this ni
ght,
    That, if again this apparition come,
    He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
  Hor.
 Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
  Ber. Sit down awhile,
    And let us once again assail your ears
,
    That are so fortified against our story,
    What we two nights have seen.
  Hor. Well, sit
 we down,
    And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
  Ber. Last night of all,
    When yond sam
e star that's westward from the pole
    Had made his course t' illume that part of heaven
    Whe
re now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
    The bell then beating one-

                        En
ter Ghost.

  Mar. Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!
  Ber. In the same figure, l
ike the King that's dead.
  Mar. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
  Ber. Looks it not lik
e the King? Mark it, Horatio.
  Hor. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.
  Ber. It woul
d be spoke to.
  Mar. Question it, Horatio.
  Hor. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night

    Together with that fair and warlike form
    In which the majesty of buried Denmark
    Did s
ometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!
  Mar. It is offended.
  Ber. See, it stalks away!

  Hor. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!
                                                  
   Exit Ghost.
  Mar. 'Tis gone and will not answer.
  Ber. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look
 pale.
    Is not this something more than fantasy?
    What think you on't?
  Hor. Before my God
, I might not this believe
    Without the sensible and true avouch
    Of mine own eyes.
  Mar. 
Is it not like the King?
  Hor. As thou art to thyself.
    Such was the very armour he had on
  
  When he th' ambitious Norway combated.
    So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,
    He sm
ote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
    'Tis strange.
  Mar. Thus twice before, and jump at this d
ead hour,
    With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
  Hor. In what particular thought to w
ork I know not;
    But, in the gross and scope of my opinion,
    This bodes some strange eruptio
n to our state.
  Mar. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows,
    Why this same strict and
 most observant watch
    So nightly toils the subject of the land,
    And why such daily cast of
 brazen cannon
    And foreign mart for implements of war;
    Why such impress of shipwrights, wh
ose sore task
    Does not divide the Sunday from the week.
    What might be toward, that this sw
eaty haste
    Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day?
    Who is't that can inform me?

  Hor. That can I.
    At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
    Whose image even but now 
appear'd to us,
    Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
    Thereto prick'd on by a most em
ulate pride,
    Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet
    (For so this side of our kno
wn world esteem'd him)
    Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,
    Well ratified b
y law and heraldry,
    Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
    Which he stood seiz'd 
of, to the conqueror;
    Against the which a moiety competent
    Was gaged by our king; which ha
d return'd
    To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
    Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'n
ant
    And carriage of the article design'd,
    His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,

    Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
    Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,
    Shar
k'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
    For food and diet, to some enterprise
    That hath a stom
ach in't; which is no other,
    As it doth well appear unto our state,
    But to recover of us, 
by strong hand
    And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
    So by his father lost; and thi
s, I take it,
    Is the main motive of our preparations,
    The source of this our watch, and th
e chief head
    Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
  Ber. I think it be no other but e'en
 so.
    Well may it sort that this portentous figure
    Comes armed through our watch, so like t
he King
    That was and is the question of these wars.
  Hor. A mote it is to trouble the mind's 
eye.
    In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
    A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
  
  The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead
    Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;

    As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood,
    Disasters in the sun; and the moist star

    Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
    Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.
 
   And even the like precurse of fierce events,
    As harbingers preceding still the fates
    An
d prologue to the omen coming on,
    Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
    Unto our cli
mature and countrymen.

                      Enter Ghost again.

    But soft! behold! Lo, wher
e it comes again!
    I'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!
                         
                      Spreads his arms.
    If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
    Speak to 
me.
    If there be any good thing to be done,
    That may to thee do ease, and, race to me,
   
 Speak to me.
    If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
    Which happily foreknowing may avoid
,
    O, speak!
    Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
    Extorted treasure in the womb of ea
rth
    (For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death),
                                    
             The cock crows.
    Speak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!
  Mar. Shall I
 strike at it with my partisan?
  Hor. Do, if it will not stand.
  Ber. 'Tis here!
  Hor. 'Tis he
re!
  Mar. 'Tis gone!
                                                     Exit Ghost.
    We do 
it wrong, being so majestical,
    To offer it the show of violence;
    For it is as the air, inv
ulnerable,
    And our vain blows malicious mockery.
  Ber. It was about to speak, when the cock c
rew.
  Hor. And then it started, like a guilty thing
    Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
   
 The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
    Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
   
 Awake the god of day; and at his warning,
    Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
    Th' ex
travagant and erring spirit hies
    To his confine; and of the truth herein
    This present obje
ct made probation.
  Mar. It faded on the crowing of the cock.
    Some say that ever, 'gainst tha
t season comes
    Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
    The bird of dawning singeth all 
night long;
    And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,
    The nights are wholesome, then
 no planets strike,
    No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
    So hallow'd and so grac
ious is the time.
  Hor. So have I heard and do in part believe it.
    But look, the morn, in rus
set mantle clad,
    Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.
    Break we our watch up; and 
by my advice
    Let us impart what we have seen to-night
    Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life
,
    This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
    Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it
,
    As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
    Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know

    Where we shall find him most conveniently.           Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A roo
m of state in the Castle.

Flourish. [Enter Claudius, King of Denmark, Gertrude the Queen,
Hamlet
,
Polonius, Laertes and his sister Ophelia, [Voltemand, Cornelius,]
Lords Attendant.

  King. Th
ough yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
    The memory be green, and that it us befitted
    T
o bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom
    To be contracted in one brow of woe,
    Yet
 so far hath discretion fought with nature
    That we with wisest sorrow think on him
    Togethe
r with remembrance of ourselves.
    Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
    Th' imperia
l jointress to this warlike state,
    Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,
    With an auspici
ous, and a dropping eye,
    With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,
    In equal scale
 weighing delight and dole,
    Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd
    Your better wisdoms, 
which have freely gone
    With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
    Now follows, that you 
know, young Fortinbras,
    Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
    Or thinking by our late dear
 brother's death
    Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
    Colleagued with this dream of 
his advantage,
    He hath not fail'd to pester us with message
    Importing the surrender of tho
se lands
    Lost by his father, with all bands of law,
    To our most valiant brother. So much f
or him.
    Now for ourself and for this time of meeting.
    Thus much the business is: we have h
ere writ
    To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,
    Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears
 
   Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress
    His further gait herein, in that the levies,
    
The lists, and full proportions are all made
    Out of his subject; and we here dispatch
    You,
 good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,
    For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,
    Giving to
 you no further personal power
    To business with the King, more than the scope
    Of these dil
ated articles allow.            [Gives a paper.]
    Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty
.
  Cor., Volt. In that, and all things, will we show our duty.
  King. We doubt it nothing. Heart
ily farewell.
                                 Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius.
    And now, Laerte
s, what's the news with you?
    You told us of some suit. What is't, Laertes?
    You cannot spea
k of reason to the Dane
    And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
    That shall no
t be my offer, not thy asking?
    The head is not more native to the heart,
    The hand more ins
trumental to the mouth,
    Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
    What wouldst thou hav
e, Laertes?
  Laer. My dread lord,
    Your leave and favour to return to France;
    From whence
 though willingly I came to Denmark
    To show my duty in your coronation,
    Yet now I must con
fess, that duty done,
    My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
    And bow them to your
 gracious leave and pardon.
  King. Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
  Pol. He ha
th, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
    By laboursome petition, and at last
    Upon his will
 I seal'd my hard consent.
    I do beseech you give him leave to go.
  King. Take thy fair hour, 
Laertes. Time be thine,
    And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
    But now, my cousin Hamle
t, and my son-
  Ham. [aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind!
  King. How is it that t
he clouds still hang on you?
  Ham. Not so, my lord. I am too much i' th' sun.
  Queen. Good Hamle
t, cast thy nighted colour off,
    And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
    Do not fo
r ever with thy vailed lids
    Seek for thy noble father in the dust.
    Thou know'st 'tis commo
n. All that lives must die,
    Passing through nature to eternity.
  Ham. Ay, madam, it is common
.
  Queen. If it be,
    Why seems it so particular with thee?
  Ham. Seems, madam, Nay, it is. I
 know not 'seems.'
    'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
    Nor customary suits of solem
n black,
    Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,
    No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
 
   Nor the dejected havior of the visage,
    Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
   
 'That can denote me truly. These indeed seem,
    For they are actions that a man might play;
   
 But I have that within which passeth show-
    These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
  Ki
ng. 'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
    To give these mourning duties to your fa
ther;
    But you must know, your father lost a father;
    That father lost, lost his, and the su
rvivor bound
    In filial obligation for some term
    To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever

    In obstinate condolement is a course
    Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief;
    It s
hows a will most incorrect to heaven,
    A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
    An understand
ing simple and unschool'd;
    For what we know must be, and is as common
    As any the most vulg
ar thing to sense,
    Why should we in our peevish opposition
    Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a f
ault to heaven,
    A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
    To reason most absurd, whose 
common theme
    Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
    From the first corse till he t
hat died to-day,
    'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth
    This unprevailing woe, and 
think of us
    As of a father; for let the world take note
    You are the most immediate to our 
throne,
    And with no less nobility of love
    Than that which dearest father bears his son
  
  Do I impart toward you. For your intent
    In going back to school in Wittenberg,
    It is mos
t retrograde to our desire;
    And we beseech you, bend you to remain
    Here in the cheer and c
omfort of our eye,
    Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
  Queen. Let not thy mother los
e her prayers, Hamlet.
    I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.
  Ham. I shall in all m
y best obey you, madam.
  King. Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.
    Be as ourself in Denmark.
 Madam, come.
    This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet
    Sits smiling to my heart; in grace
 whereof,
    No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day
    But the great cannon to the clouds s
hall tell,
    And the King's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,
    Respeaking earthly thunder. 
Come away.
                                Flourish. Exeunt all but Hamlet.
  Ham. O that this too
 too solid flesh would melt,
    Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!
    Or that the Everlasting 
had not fix'd
    His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
    How weary, stale, flat, and un
profitable
    Seem to me all the uses of this world!
    Fie on't! ah, fie! 'Tis an unweeded gard
en
    That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
    Possess it merely. That it should c
ome to this!
    But two months dead! Nay, not so much, not two.
    So excellent a king, that was
 to this
    Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
    That he might not beteem the winds of
 heaven
    Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
    Must I remember? Why, she would hang
 on him
    As if increase of appetite had grown
    By what it fed on; and yet, within a month-

    Let me not think on't! Frailty, thy name is woman!-
    A little month, or ere those shoes were
 old
    With which she followed my poor father's body
    Like Niobe, all tears- why she, even sh
e
    (O God! a beast that wants discourse of reason
    Would have mourn'd longer) married with m
y uncle;
    My father's brother, but no more like my father
    Than I to Hercules. Within a mont
h,
    Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
    Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
 
   She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
    With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
    It
 is not, nor it cannot come to good.
    But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue!

        
  Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo.

  Hor. Hail to your lordship!
  Ham. I am glad to see 
you well.
    Horatio!- or I do forget myself.
  Hor. The same, my lord, and your poor servant eve
r.
  Ham. Sir, my good friend- I'll change that name with you.
    And what make you from Wittenbe
rg, Horatio?
    Marcellus?
  Mar. My good lord!
  Ham. I am very glad to see you.- [To Bernardo]
 Good even, sir.-

    But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
  Hor. A truant disposition,
 good my lord.
  Ham. I would not hear your enemy say so,
    Nor shall you do my ear that violenc
e
    To make it truster of your own report
    Against yourself. I know you are no truant.
    B
ut what is your affair in Elsinore?
    We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
  Hor. My lo
rd, I came to see your father's funeral.
  Ham. I prithee do not mock me, fellow student.
    I th
ink it was to see my mother's wedding.
  Hor. Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.
  Ham. Thrif
t, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats
    Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
    
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
    Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
    My father- 
methinks I see my father.
  Hor. O, where, my lord?
  Ham. In my mind's eye, Horatio.
  Hor. I sa
w him once. He was a goodly king.
  Ham. He was a man, take him for all in all.
    I shall not lo
ok upon his like again.
  Hor. My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
  Ham. Saw? who?
  Hor. My
 lord, the King your father.
  Ham. The King my father?
  Hor. Season your admiration for a while

    With an attent ear, till I may deliver
    Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
    This marv
el to you.
  Ham. For God's love let me hear!
  Hor. Two nights together had these gentlemen
    
(Marcellus and Bernardo) on their watch
    In the dead vast and middle of the night
    Been thus
 encount'red. A figure like your father,
    Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
    Appears before 
them and with solemn march
    Goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walk'd
    By their oppres
s'd and fear-surprised eyes,
    Within his truncheon's length; whilst they distill'd
    Almost t
o jelly with the act of fear,
    Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
    In dreadful secr
ecy impart they did,
    And I with them the third night kept the watch;
    Where, as they had de
liver'd, both in time,
    Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
    The apparition com
es. I knew your father.
    These hands are not more like.
  Ham. But where was this?
  Mar. My l
ord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
  Ham. Did you not speak to it?
  Hor. My lord, I did;
 
   But answer made it none. Yet once methought
    It lifted up it head and did address
    Itself
 to motion, like as it would speak;
    But even then the morning cock crew loud,
    And at the s
ound it shrunk in haste away
    And vanish'd from our sight.
  Ham. 'Tis very strange.
  Hor. As
 I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
    And we did think it writ down in our duty
    To let 
you know of it.
  Ham. Indeed, indeed, sirs. But this troubles me.
    Hold you the watch to-night
?
  Both [Mar. and Ber.] We do, my lord.
  Ham. Arm'd, say you?
  Both. Arm'd, my lord.
  Ham. F
rom top to toe?
  Both. My lord, from head to foot.
  Ham. Then saw you not his face?
  Hor. O, y
es, my lord! He wore his beaver up.
  Ham. What, look'd he frowningly.
  Hor. A countenance more i
n sorrow than in anger.
  Ham. Pale or red?
  Hor. Nay, very pale.
  Ham. And fix'd his eyes upon
 you?
  Hor. Most constantly.
  Ham. I would I had been there.
  Hor. It would have much amaz'd y
ou.
  Ham. Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
  Hor. While one with moderate haste might tell a
 hundred.
  Both. Longer, longer.
  Hor. Not when I saw't.
  Ham. His beard was grizzled- no?
  
Hor. It was, as I have seen it in his life,
    A sable silver'd.
  Ham. I will watch to-night.
 
   Perchance 'twill walk again.
  Hor. I warr'nt it will.
  Ham. If it assume my noble father's pe
rson,
    I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
    And bid me hold my peace. I pray yo
u all,
    If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
    Let it be tenable in your silence still;

    And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
    Give it an understanding but no tongue.
    I wi
ll requite your loves. So, fare you well.
    Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
    I'l
l visit you.
  All. Our duty to your honour.
  Ham. Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell.
       
                                 Exeunt [all but Hamlet].
    My father's spirit- in arms? All is n
ot well.
    I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come!
    Till then sit still, my soul. 
Foul deeds will rise,
    Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
Exit.




Scene
 III.
Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius.

Enter Laertes and Ophelia.

  Laer. My necess
aries are embark'd. Farewell.
    And, sister, as the winds give benefit
    And convoy is assista
nt, do not sleep,
    But let me hear from you.
  Oph. Do you doubt that?
  Laer. For Hamlet, and
 the trifling of his favour,
    Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood;
    A violet in the youth 
of primy nature,
    Forward, not permanent- sweet, not lasting;
    The perfume and suppliance of
 a minute;
    No more.
  Oph. No more but so?
  Laer. Think it no more.
    For nature crescent
 does not grow alone
    In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,
    The inward service of th
e mind and soul
    Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
    And now no soil nor cautel do
th besmirch
    The virtue of his will; but you must fear,
    His greatness weigh'd, his will is 
not his own;
    For he himself is subject to his birth.
    He may not, as unvalued persons do,

    Carve for himself, for on his choice depends
    The safety and health of this whole state,
  
  And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd
    Unto the voice and yielding of that body
    
Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
    It fits your wisdom so far to believe it

    As he in his particular act and place
    May give his saying deed; which is no further
    T
han the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
    Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain
    If
 with too credent ear you list his songs,
    Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
   
 To his unmast'red importunity.
    Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
    And keep you in
 the rear of your affection,
    Out of the shot and danger of desire.
    The chariest maid is pr
odigal enough
    If she unmask her beauty to the moon.
    Virtue itself scopes not calumnious st
rokes.
    The canker galls the infants of the spring
    Too oft before their buttons be disclos'
d,
    And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
    Contagious blastments are most imminent.
    B
e wary then; best safety lies in fear.
    Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
  Oph. I
 shall th' effect of this good lesson keep
    As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
    
Do not as some ungracious pastors do,
    Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven,
    Whiles, 
like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
    Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads
    And re
cks not his own rede.
  Laer. O, fear me not!

                       Enter Polonius.

    I st
ay too long. But here my father comes.
    A double blessing is a double grace;
    Occasion smile
s upon a second leave.
  Pol. Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame!
    The wind sits in t
he shoulder of your sail,
    And you are stay'd for. There- my blessing with thee!
    And these 
few precepts in thy memory
    Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
    Nor any unpro
portion'd thought his act.
    Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar:
    Those friends thou ha
st, and their adoption tried,
    Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel;
    But do not d
ull thy palm with entertainment
    Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware
    Of entrance
 to a quarrel; but being in,
    Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee.
    Give every man th
ine ear, but few thy voice;
    Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
    Costly thy 
habit as thy purse can buy,
    But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
    For the apparel o
ft proclaims the man,
    And they in France of the best rank and station
    Are most select and 
generous, chief in that.
    Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
    For loan oft loses both itsel
f and friend,
    And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
    This above all- to thine own self
 be true,
    And it must follow, as the night the day,
    Thou canst not then be false to any ma
n.
    Farewell. My blessing season this in thee!
  Laer. Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.

  Pol. The time invites you. Go, your servants tend.
  Laer. Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well

    What I have said to you.
  Oph. 'Tis in my memory lock'd,
    And you yourself shall keep th
e key of it.
  Laer. Farewell.                                          Exit.
  Pol. What is't, Op
helia, he hath said to you?
  Oph. So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
  Pol. Marry
, well bethought!
    'Tis told me he hath very oft of late
    Given private time to you, and you
 yourself
    Have of your audience been most free and bounteous.
    If it be so- as so 'tis put 
on me,
    And that in way of caution- I must tell you
    You do not understand yourself so clear
ly
    As it behooves my daughter and your honour.
    What is between you? Give me up the truth.

  Oph. He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
    Of his affection to me.
  Pol. Affection? 
Pooh! You speak like a green girl,
    Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
    Do you believe 
his tenders, as you call them?
  Oph. I do not know, my lord, what I should think,
  Pol. Marry, I
 will teach you! Think yourself a baby
    That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
    Whi
ch are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,
    Or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,

    Running it thus) you'll tender me a fool.
  Oph. My lord, he hath importun'd me with love
  
  In honourable fashion.
  Pol. Ay, fashion you may call it. Go to, go to!
  Oph. And hath given c
ountenance to his speech, my lord,
    With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
  Pol. Ay, springe
s to catch woodcocks! I do know,
    When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
    Lends the ton
gue vows. These blazes, daughter,
    Giving more light than heat, extinct in both
    Even in the
ir promise, as it is a-making,
    You must not take for fire. From this time
    Be something sca
nter of your maiden presence.
    Set your entreatments at a higher rate
    Than a command to par
ley. For Lord Hamlet,
    Believe so much in him, that he is young,
    And with a larger tether m
ay he walk
    Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia,
    Do not believe his vows; for they are b
rokers,
    Not of that dye which their investments show,
    But mere implorators of unholy suits
,
    Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
    The better to beguile. This is for all:
    
I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth
    Have you so slander any moment leisure
    A
s to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
    Look to't, I charge you. Come your ways.
  Oph. 
I shall obey, my lord.
                                                         Exeunt.




Sc
ene IV.
Elsinore. The platform before the Castle.

Enter Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus.

  Ham
. The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
  Hor. It is a nipping and an eager air.
  Ham. What ho
ur now?
  Hor. I think it lacks of twelve.
  Mar. No, it is struck.
  Hor. Indeed? I heard it not
. It then draws near the season
    Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
                   A
 flourish of trumpets, and two pieces go off.
    What does this mean, my lord?
  Ham. The King do
th wake to-night and takes his rouse,
    Keeps wassail, and the swagg'ring upspring reels,
    An
d, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
    The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out
    The
 triumph of his pledge.
  Hor. Is it a custom?
  Ham. Ay, marry, is't;
    But to my mind, though
 I am native here
    And to the manner born, it is a custom
    More honour'd in the breach than 
the observance.
    This heavy-headed revel east and west
    Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other
 nations;
    They clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase
    Soil our addition; and indeed it 
takes
    From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
    The pith and marrow of our attrib
ute.
    So oft it chances in particular men
    That, for some vicious mole of nature in them,
 
   As in their birth,- wherein they are not guilty,
    Since nature cannot choose his origin,-
  
  By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
    Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
    O
r by some habit that too much o'erleavens
    The form of plausive manners, that these men
    Car
rying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
    Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,
    Their vir
tues else- be they as pure as grace,
    As infinite as man may undergo-
    Shall in the general 
censure take corruption
    From that particular fault. The dram of e'il
    Doth all the noble su
bstance often dout To his own scandal.

                         Enter Ghost.

  Hor. Look, my l
ord, it comes!
  Ham. Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
    Be thou a spirit of health or g
oblin damn'd,
    Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
    Be thy intents wicked 
or charitable,
    Thou com'st in such a questionable shape
    That I will speak to thee. I'll ca
ll thee Hamlet,
    King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me?
    Let me not burst in ignorance, but
 tell
    Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,
    Have burst their cerements; why the sepul
chre
    Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
    Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws
    To 
cast thee up again. What may this mean
    That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,
    Rev
isits thus the glimpses of the moon,
    Making night hideous, and we fools of nature
    So horri
dly to shake our disposition
    With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
    Say, why is th
is? wherefore? What should we do?
                                           Ghost beckons Hamlet.

  Hor. It beckons you to go away with it,
    As if it some impartment did desire
    To you alon
e.
  Mar. Look with what courteous action
    It waves you to a more removed ground.
    But do n
ot go with it!
  Hor. No, by no means!
  Ham. It will not speak. Then will I follow it.
  Hor. Do
 not, my lord!
  Ham. Why, what should be the fear?
    I do not set my life at a pin's fee;
    
And for my soul, what can it do to that,
    Being a thing immortal as itself?
    It waves me for
th again. I'll follow it.
  Hor. What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
    Or to the dre
adful summit of the cliff
    That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
    And there assume some o
ther, horrible form
    Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
    And draw you into madne
ss? Think of it.
    The very place puts toys of desperation,
    Without more motive, into every 
brain
    That looks so many fadoms to the sea
    And hears it roar beneath.
  Ham. It waves me 
still.
    Go on. I'll follow thee.
  Mar. You shall not go, my lord.
  Ham. Hold off your hands!

  Hor. Be rul'd. You shall not go.
  Ham. My fate cries out
    And makes each petty artire in t
his body
    As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
                                                
[Ghost beckons.]

    Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
    By heaven, I'll make a ghost o
f him that lets me!-
    I say, away!- Go on. I'll follow thee.
                                  
      Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet.
  Hor. He waxes desperate with imagination.
  Mar. Let's follow. 'T
is not fit thus to obey him.
  Hor. Have after. To what issue will this come?
  Mar. Something is 
rotten in the state of Denmark.
  Hor. Heaven will direct it.
  Mar. Nay, let's follow him.
     
                                                    Exeunt.




Scene V.
Elsinore. The Castle.
 Another part of the fortifications.

Enter Ghost and Hamlet.

  Ham. Whither wilt thou lead me?
 Speak! I'll go no further.
  Ghost. Mark me.
  Ham. I will.
  Ghost. My hour is almost come,
  
  When I to sulph'rous and tormenting flames
    Must render up myself.
  Ham. Alas, poor ghost!

  Ghost. Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
    To what I shall unfold.
  Ham. Speak. I am 
bound to hear.
  Ghost. So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
  Ham. What?
  Ghost. I am 
thy father's spirit,
    Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
    And for the day confin'd
 to fast in fires,
    Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
    Are burnt and purg'd awa
y. But that I am forbid
    To tell the secrets of my prison house,
    I could a tale unfold whos
e lightest word
    Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
    Make thy two eyes, like 
stars, start from their spheres,
    Thy knotted and combined locks to part,
    And each particul
ar hair to stand on end
    Like quills upon the fretful porcupine.
    But this eternal blazon mu
st not be
    To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
    If thou didst ever thy dear fat
her love-
  Ham. O God!
  Ghost. Revenge his foul and most unnatural murther.
  Ham. Murther?
  
Ghost. Murther most foul, as in the best it is;
    But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.
  
Ham. Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
    As meditation or the thoughts of love,
  
  May sweep to my revenge.
  Ghost. I find thee apt;
    And duller shouldst thou be than the fat 
weed
    That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
    Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, 
hear.
    'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
    A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of
 Denmark
    Is by a forged process of my death
    Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth,
  
  The serpent that did sting thy father's life
    Now wears his crown.
  Ham. O my prophetic soul
!
    My uncle?
  Ghost. Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
    With witchcraft of his w
it, with traitorous gifts-
    O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
    So to seduce!- won 
to his shameful lust
    The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.
    O Hamlet, what a falling-
off was there,
    From me, whose love was of that dignity
    That it went hand in hand even with
 the vow
    I made to her in marriage, and to decline
    Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were 
poor
    To those of mine!
    But virtue, as it never will be mov'd,
    Though lewdness court i
t in a shape of heaven,
    So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
    Will sate itself in a c
elestial bed
    And prey on garbage.
    But soft! methinks I scent the morning air.
    Brief l
et me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
    My custom always of the afternoon,
    Upon my secure ho
ur thy uncle stole,
    With juice of cursed hebona in a vial,
    And in the porches of my ears d
id pour
    The leperous distilment; whose effect
    Holds such an enmity with blood of man
    
That swift as quicksilver it courses through
    The natural gates and alleys of the body,
    And
 with a sudden vigour it doth posset
    And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
    The thin an
d wholesome blood. So did it mine;
    And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
    Most lazar-like
, with vile and loathsome crust
    All my smooth body.
    Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's h
and
    Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd;
    Cut off even in the blossoms of my si
n,
    Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd,
    No reckoning made, but sent to my account
    With
 all my imperfections on my head.
  Ham. O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
  Ghost. If thou
 hast nature in thee, bear it not.
    Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
    A couch for luxury 
and damned incest.
    But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
    Taint not thy mind, nor let thy 
soul contrive
    Against thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven,
    And to those thorns that in h
er bosom lodge
    To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once.
    The glowworm shows the mati
n to be near
    And gins to pale his uneffectual fire.
    Adieu, adieu, adieu! Remember me.     
                 Exit.

  Ham. O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?
    And shall I coup
le hell? Hold, hold, my heart!
    And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
    But bear me stiff
ly up. Remember thee?
    Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
    In this distracted gl
obe. Remember thee?
    Yea, from the table of my memory
    I'll wipe away all trivial fond recor
ds,
    All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past
    That youth and observation copied the
re,
    And thy commandment all alone shall live
    Within the book and volume of my brain,
    
Unmix'd with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!
    O most pernicious woman!
    O villain, villain, sm
iling, damned villain!
    My tables! Meet it is I set it down
    That one may smile, and smile, 
and be a villain;
    At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark.        [Writes.]
    So, uncle, 
there you are. Now to my word:
    It is 'Adieu, adieu! Remember me.'
    I have sworn't.
  Hor. 
(within) My lord, my lord!

                   Enter Horatio and Marcellus.

  Mar. Lord Hamlet!

  Hor. Heaven secure him!
  Ham. So be it!
  Mar. Illo, ho, ho, my lord!
  Ham. Hillo, ho, ho, 
boy! Come, bird, come.
  Mar. How is't, my noble lord?
  Hor. What news, my lord?
  Mar. O, wonde
rful!
  Hor. Good my lord, tell it.
  Ham. No, you will reveal it.
  Hor. Not I, my lord, by heav
en!
  Mar. Nor I, my lord.
  Ham. How say you then? Would heart of man once think it?
    But you
'll be secret?
  Both. Ay, by heaven, my lord.
  Ham. There's neer a villain dwelling in all Denma
rk
    But he's an arrant knave.
  Hor. There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
    To
 tell us this.
  Ham. Why, right! You are in the right!
    And so, without more circumstance at a
ll,
    I hold it fit that we shake hands and part;
    You, as your business and desires shall po
int you,
    For every man hath business and desire,
    Such as it is; and for my own poor part,

    Look you, I'll go pray.
  Hor. These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
  Ham. I am so
rry they offend you, heartily;
    Yes, faith, heartily.
  Hor. There's no offence, my lord.
  Ha
m. Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
    And much offence too. Touching this vision her
e,
    It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.
    For your desire to know what is between us
,
    O'ermaster't as you may. And now, good friends,
    As you are friends, scholars, and soldie
rs,
    Give me one poor request.
  Hor. What is't, my lord? We will.
  Ham. Never make known wha
t you have seen to-night.
  Both. My lord, we will not.
  Ham. Nay, but swear't.
  Hor. In faith,

    My lord, not I.
  Mar. Nor I, my lord- in faith.
  Ham. Upon my sword.
  Mar. We have sworn
, my lord, already.
  Ham. Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.

                 Ghost cries under the
 stage.

  Ghost. Swear.
  Ham. Aha boy, say'st thou so? Art thou there, truepenny?
    Come on!
 You hear this fellow in the cellarage.
    Consent to swear.
  Hor. Propose the oath, my lord.
 
 Ham. Never to speak of this that you have seen.
    Swear by my sword.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear.

  Ham. Hic et ubique? Then we'll shift our ground.
    Come hither, gentlemen,
    And lay your h
ands again upon my sword.
    Never to speak of this that you have heard:
    Swear by my sword.

  Ghost. [beneath] Swear by his sword.
  Ham. Well said, old mole! Canst work i' th' earth so fast?

    A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends."
  Hor. O day and night, but this is wondrou
s strange!
  Ham. And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
    There are more things in heaven
 and earth, Horatio,
    Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
    But come!
    Here, as before
, never, so help you mercy,
    How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself
    (As I perchance hereaf
ter shall think meet
    To put an antic disposition on),
    That you, at such times seeing me, n
ever shall,
    With arms encumb'red thus, or this head-shake,
    Or by pronouncing of some doubt
ful phrase,
    As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'
    Or 'If we list to spe
ak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'
    Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
    That you know 
aught of me- this is not to do,
    So grace and mercy at your most need help you,
    Swear.
  G
host. [beneath] Swear.
                                                   [They swear.]
  Ham. Res
t, rest, perturbed spirit! So, gentlemen,
    With all my love I do commend me to you;
    And wha
t so poor a man as Hamlet is
    May do t' express his love and friending to you,
    God willing,
 shall not lack. Let us go in together;
    And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
    The t
ime is out of joint. O cursed spite
    That ever I was born to set it right!
    Nay, come, let's
 go together.
                                                         Exeunt.

Act II. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius.

Enter Polonius and Reynaldo.

  P
ol. Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
  Rey. I will, my lord.
  Pol. You shall do mar
vell's wisely, good Reynaldo,
    Before You visit him, to make inquire
    Of his behaviour.
  R
ey. My lord, I did intend it.
  Pol. Marry, well said, very well said. Look you, sir,
    Enquire 
me first what Danskers are in Paris;
    And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
    Wh
at company, at what expense; and finding
    By this encompassment and drift of question
    That 
they do know my son, come you more nearer
    Than your particular demands will touch it.
    Take
 you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
    As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
 
   And in part him.' Do you mark this, Reynaldo?
  Rey. Ay, very well, my lord.
  Pol. 'And in par
t him, but,' you may say, 'not well.
    But if't be he I mean, he's very wild
    Addicted so and
 so'; and there put on him
    What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
    As may dishonour
 him- take heed of that;
    But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips
    As are companions no
ted and most known
    To youth and liberty.
  Rey. As gaming, my lord.
  Pol. Ay, or drinking, f
encing, swearing, quarrelling,
    Drabbing. You may go so far.
  Rey. My lord, that would dishono
ur him.
  Pol. Faith, no, as you may season it in the charge.
    You must not put another scandal
 on him,
    That he is open to incontinency.
    That's not my meaning. But breathe his faults so
 quaintly
    That they may seem the taints of liberty,
    The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind
,
    A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
    Of general assault.
  Rey. But, my good lord-
  Pol
. Wherefore should you do this?
  Rey. Ay, my lord,
    I would know that.
  Pol. Marry, sir, her
e's my drift,
    And I believe it is a fetch of warrant.
    You laying these slight sullies on m
y son
    As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' th' working,
    Mark you,
    Your party in conve
rse, him you would sound,
    Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
    The youth you breathe
 of guilty, be assur'd
    He closes with you in this consequence:
    'Good sir,' or so, or 'frie
nd,' or 'gentleman'-
    According to the phrase or the addition
    Of man and country-
  Rey. V
ery good, my lord.
  Pol. And then, sir, does 'a this- 'a does- What was I about to
say?
    By t
he mass, I was about to say something! Where did I leave?
  Rey. At 'closes in the consequence,' at
 'friend or so,' and
    gentleman.'
  Pol. At 'closes in the consequence'- Ay, marry!
    He clo
ses thus: 'I know the gentleman.
    I saw him yesterday, or t'other day,
    Or then, or then, wi
th such or such; and, as you say,
    There was 'a gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
    There fa
lling out at tennis'; or perchance,
    'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'
    Videlicet, a b
rothel, or so forth.
    See you now-
    Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth;
    An
d thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
    With windlasses and with assays of bias,
    By indirecti
ons find directions out.
    So, by my former lecture and advice,
    Shall you my son. You have m
e, have you not?
  Rey. My lord, I have.
  Pol. God b' wi' ye, fare ye well!
  Rey. Good my lord!
                                    [Going.]
  Pol. Observe his inclination in yourself.
  Rey. I 
shall, my lord.
  Pol. And let him ply his music.
  Rey. Well, my lord.
  Pol. Farewell!
       
                                           Exit Reynaldo.

                       Enter Ophelia.


    How now, Ophelia? What's the matter?
  Oph. O my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
 
 Pol. With what, i' th' name of God?
  Oph. My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
    Lord Hamlet
, with his doublet all unbrac'd,
    No hat upon his head, his stockings foul'd,
    Ungart'red, a
nd down-gyved to his ankle;
    Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,
    And with a l
ook so piteous in purport
    As if he had been loosed out of hell
    To speak of horrors- he com
es before me.
  Pol. Mad for thy love?
  Oph. My lord, I do not know,
    But truly I do fear it.

  Pol. What said he?
  Oph. He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
    Then goes he to the le
ngth of all his arm,
    And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
    He falls to such perusal
 of my face
    As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so.
    At last, a little shaking of mine arm,

    And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
    He rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound
  
  As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
    And end his being. That done, he lets me go,
    And 
with his head over his shoulder turn'd
    He seem'd to find his way without his eyes,
    For out
 o' doors he went without their help
    And to the last bended their light on me.
  Pol. Come, go
 with me. I will go seek the King.
    This is the very ecstasy of love,
    Whose violent propert
y fordoes itself
    And leads the will to desperate undertakings
    As oft as any passion under 
heaven
    That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
    What, have you given him any hard words 
of late?
  Oph. No, my good lord; but, as you did command,
    I did repel his letters and denied

    His access to me.
  Pol. That hath made him mad.
    I am sorry that with better heed and jud
gment
    I had not quoted him. I fear'd he did but trifle
    And meant to wrack thee; but beshre
w my jealousy!
    By heaven, it is as proper to our age
    To cast beyond ourselves in our opini
ons
    As it is common for the younger sort
    To lack discretion. Come, go we to the King.
   
 This must be known; which, being kept close, might move
    More grief to hide than hate to utter 
love.
    Come.
                                                         Exeunt.

Scene II.
Els
inore. A room in the Castle.

Flourish. [Enter King and Queen, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern,
cum 
aliis.

  King. Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
    Moreover that we much did long to
 see you,
    The need we have to use you did provoke
    Our hasty sending. Something have you he
ard
    Of Hamlet's transformation. So I call it,
    Sith nor th' exterior nor the inward man
  
  Resembles that it was. What it should be,
    More than his father's death, that thus hath put hi
m
    So much from th' understanding of himself,
    I cannot dream of. I entreat you both
    Th
at, being of so young days brought up with him,
    And since so neighbour'd to his youth and havio
ur,
    That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
    Some little time; so by your companies

    To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather
    So much as from occasion you may glean,
    Wh
ether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus
    That, open'd, lies within our remedy.
  Queen. Goo
d gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,
    And sure I am two men there are not living
    To who
m he more adheres. If it will please you
    To show us so much gentry and good will
    As to exp
end your time with us awhile
    For the supply and profit of our hope,
    Your visitation shall 
receive such thanks
    As fits a king's remembrance.
  Ros. Both your Majesties
    Might, by th
e sovereign power you have of us,
    Put your dread pleasures more into command
    Than to entre
aty.
  Guil. But we both obey,
    And here give up ourselves, in the full bent,
    To lay our s
ervice freely at your feet,
    To be commanded.
  King. Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenste
rn.
  Queen. Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz.
    And I beseech you instantly to visit

    My too much changed son.- Go, some of you,
    And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
  
Guil. Heavens make our presence and our practices
    Pleasant and helpful to him!
  Queen. Ay, am
en!
                 Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, [with some
                             
                       Attendants].

                         Enter Polonius.

  Pol. Th' ambass
adors from Norway, my good lord,
    Are joyfully return'd.
  King. Thou still hast been the fathe
r of good news.
  Pol. Have I, my lord? Assure you, my good liege,
    I hold my duty as I hold my
 soul,
    Both to my God and to my gracious king;
    And I do think- or else this brain of mine

    Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
    As it hath us'd to do- that I have found
    The ve
ry cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
  King. O, speak of that! That do I long to hear.
  Pol. Give first a
dmittance to th' ambassadors.
    My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
  King. Thyself 
do grace to them, and bring them in.
                                                [Exit Polonius
.]
    He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found
    The head and source of all your son's dist
emper.
  Queen. I doubt it is no other but the main,
    His father's death and our o'erhasty marr
iage.
  King. Well, we shall sift him.

              Enter Polonius, Voltemand, and Cornelius.


    Welcome, my good friends.
    Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?
  Volt. Most fai
r return of greetings and desires.
    Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
    His nephew's le
vies; which to him appear'd
    To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack,
    But better look'd into
, he truly found
    It was against your Highness; whereat griev'd,
    That so his sickness, age,
 and impotence
    Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
    On Fortinbras; which he, in br
ief, obeys,
    Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,
    Makes vow before his uncle never mo
re
    To give th' assay of arms against your Majesty.
    Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,

    Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee
    And his commission to employ those soldiers,

    So levied as before, against the Polack;
    With an entreaty, herein further shown,
       
                                         [Gives a paper.]
    That it might please you to give quie
t pass
    Through your dominions for this enterprise,
    On such regards of safety and allowance

    As therein are set down.
  King. It likes us well;
    And at our more consider'd time we'll
 read,
    Answer, and think upon this business.
    Meantime we thank you for your well-took labo
ur.
    Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together.
    Most welcome home!                    
   Exeunt Ambassadors.
  Pol. This business is well ended.
    My liege, and madam, to expostulate

    What majesty should be, what duty is,
    Why day is day, night is night, and time is time.

    Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time.
    Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit
,
    And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
    I will be brief. Your noble son is mad
.
    Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,
    What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
 
   But let that go.
  Queen. More matter, with less art.
  Pol. Madam, I swear I use no art at all
.
    That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
    And pity 'tis 'tis true. A foolish figur
e!
    But farewell it, for I will use no art.
    Mad let us grant him then. And now remains
   
 That we find out the cause of this effect-
    Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
    For t
his effect defective comes by cause.
    Thus it remains, and the remainder thus.
    Perpend.
  
  I have a daughter (have while she is mine),
    Who in her duty and obedience, mark,
    Hath gi
ven me this. Now gather, and surmise.
                                             [Reads] the lett
er.
    'To the celestial, and my soul's idol, the most beautified
      Ophelia,'-

    That's 
an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is a vile
      phrase.
    But you shall hear. Thus:

                                                        [Reads.]
    'In her excellent white bosom,
 these, &c.'
  Queen. Came this from Hamlet to her?
  Pol. Good madam, stay awhile. I will be fait
hful.     [Reads.]


          'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
            Doubt that the sun do
th move;
          Doubt truth to be a liar;
            But never doubt I love.
      'O dear Op
helia, I am ill at these numbers; I have not art
to
    reckon my groans; but that I love thee bes
t, O most best,
believe
    it. Adieu.
      'Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine
 is to
him,

HAMLET.'

    This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me;
    And more above, 
hath his solicitings,
    As they fell out by time, by means, and place,
    All given to mine ear
.
  King. But how hath she
    Receiv'd his love?
  Pol. What do you think of me?
  King. As of 
a man faithful and honourable.
  Pol. I would fain prove so. But what might you think,
    When I 
had seen this hot love on the wing
    (As I perceiv'd it, I must tell you that,
    Before my dau
ghter told me), what might you,
    Or my dear Majesty your queen here, think,
    If I had play'd
 the desk or table book,
    Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
    Or look'd upon this l
ove with idle sight?
    What might you think? No, I went round to work
    And my young mistress 
thus I did bespeak:
    'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star.
    This must not be.' And then
 I prescripts gave her,
    That she should lock herself from his resort,
    Admit no messengers,
 receive no tokens.
    Which done, she took the fruits of my advice,
    And he, repulsed, a shor
t tale to make,
    Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
    Thence to a watch, thence into a we
akness,
    Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
    Into the madness wherein now he ra
ves,
    And all we mourn for.
  King. Do you think 'tis this?
  Queen. it may be, very like.
  
Pol. Hath there been such a time- I would fain know that-
    That I have Positively said ''Tis so,
'
    When it prov'd otherwise.?
  King. Not that I know.
  Pol. [points to his head and shoulder
] Take this from this, if
this
      be otherwise.
    If circumstances lead me, I will find
   
 Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
    Within the centre.
  King. How may we try it fu
rther?
  Pol. You know sometimes he walks for hours together
    Here in the lobby.
  Queen. So h
e does indeed.
  Pol. At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him.
    Be you and I behind an arr
as then.
    Mark the encounter. If he love her not,
    And he not from his reason fall'n thereon

    Let me be no assistant for a state,
    But keep a farm and carters.
  King. We will try it.


                 Enter Hamlet, reading on a book.

  Queen. But look where sadly the poor wret
ch comes reading.
  Pol. Away, I do beseech you, both away
    I'll board him presently. O, give m
e leave.
                       Exeunt King and Queen, [with Attendants].
    How does my good Lor
d Hamlet?
  Ham. Well, God-a-mercy.
  Pol. Do you know me, my lord?
  Ham. Excellent well. You ar
e a fishmonger.
  Pol. Not I, my lord.
  Ham. Then I would you were so honest a man.
  Pol. Hones
t, my lord?
  Ham. Ay, sir. To be honest, as this world goes, is to be one
man
    pick'd out of 
ten thousand.
  Pol. That's very true, my lord.
  Ham. For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog,
 being a god
    kissing carrion- Have you a daughter?
  Pol. I have, my lord.
  Ham. Let her not
 walk i' th' sun. Conception is a blessing, but
not
    as your daughter may conceive. Friend, loo
k to't.
  Pol. [aside] How say you by that? Still harping on my daughter.
Yet
    he knew me not 
at first. He said I was a fishmonger. He is
far
    gone, far gone! And truly in my youth I suff'r
ed much
extremity
    for love- very near this. I'll speak to him again.- What do
you
    read, 
my lord?
  Ham. Words, words, words.
  Pol. What is the matter, my lord?
  Ham. Between who?
  P
ol. I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
  Ham. Slanders, sir; for the satirical rogue says h
ere that old
men
    have grey beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes
    purging thic
k amber and plum-tree gum; and that they have a
    plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak 
hams. All
which,
    sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I
hold it
    not h
onesty to have it thus set down; for you yourself, sir,
    should be old as I am if, like a crab, 
you could go backward.

  Pol. [aside] Though this be madness, yet there is a method
in't.-
   W
ill You walk out of the air, my lord?
  Ham. Into my grave?
  Pol. Indeed, that is out o' th' air.
 [Aside] How pregnant
sometimes
    his replies are! a happiness that often madness hits on,
whic
h
    reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of.
I
    will leave him and sudde
nly contrive the means of meeting
between
    him and my daughter.- My honourable lord, I will mos
t humbly
take
    my leave of you.
  Ham. You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more

    willingly part withal- except my life, except my life, except
my
    life,

              
      Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Pol. Fare you well, my lord.
  Ham. These tedious ol
d fools!
  Pol. You go to seek the Lord Hamlet. There he is.
  Ros. [to Polonius] God save you, si
r!
                                                Exit [Polonius].

  Guil. My honour'd lord!
 
 Ros. My most dear lord!
  Ham. My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern?
Ah,
    R
osencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
  Ros. As the indifferent children of the earth.
  Guil. Ha
ppy in that we are not over-happy.
    On Fortune's cap we are not the very button.
  Ham. Nor the
 soles of her shoe?
  Ros. Neither, my lord.
  Ham. Then you live about her waist, or in the middl
e of her
    favours?
  Guil. Faith, her privates we.
  Ham. In the secret parts of Fortune? O! m
ost true! she is a
    strumpet. What news ?
  Ros. None, my lord, but that the world's grown hone
st.
  Ham. Then is doomsday near! But your news is not true. Let me
    question more in particula
r. What have you, my good friends,
    deserved at the hands of Fortune that she sends you to priso
n
    hither?
  Guil. Prison, my lord?
  Ham. Denmark's a prison.
  Ros. Then is the world one.

  Ham. A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and
    dungeons, Denmark being one 
o' th' worst.
  Ros. We think not so, my lord.
  Ham. Why, then 'tis none to you; for there is not
hing either
good
    or bad but thinking makes it so. To me it is a prison.
  Ros. Why, then your
 ambition makes it one. 'Tis too narrow for
your
    mind.
  Ham. O God, I could be bounded in a 
nutshell and count myself a
    king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.
  Guil
. Which dreams indeed are ambition; for the very substance
of
    the ambitious is merely the shad
ow of a dream.
  Ham. A dream itself is but a shadow.
  Ros. Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy
 and light a quality
that
    it is but a shadow's shadow.
  Ham. Then are our beggars bodies, an
d our monarchs and
outstretch'd
    heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we to th' court? for, by
m
y
    fay, I cannot reason.
  Both. We'll wait upon you.
  Ham. No such matter! I will not sort y
ou with the rest of my
    servants; for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most
    dreadf
ully attended. But in the beaten way of friendship,
what
    make you at Elsinore?
  Ros. To visi
t you, my lord; no other occasion.
  Ham. Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank

you;
    and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny.
Were
    you not sent for? I
s it your own inclining? Is it a free
    visitation? Come, deal justly with me. Come, come! Nay,

speak.
  Guil. What should we say, my lord?
  Ham. Why, anything- but to th' purpose. You were sen
t for; and
    there is a kind of confession in your looks, which your
modesties
    have not cra
ft enough to colour. I know the good King and
Queen
    have sent for you.
  Ros. To what end, my
 lord?
  Ham. That you must teach me. But let me conjure you by the
rights
    of our fellowship,
 by the consonancy of our youth, by the
    obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more
 dear
a
    better proposer could charge you withal, be even and direct
with
    me, whether you
 were sent for or no.
  Ros. [aside to Guildenstern] What say you?
  Ham. [aside] Nay then, I have
 an eye of you.- If you love me,
hold
    not off.
  Guil. My lord, we were sent for.
  Ham. I w
ill tell you why. So shall my anticipation prevent your
    discovery, and your secrecy to the King
 and Queen moult no
    feather. I have of late- but wherefore I know not- lost all
my
    mirth,
 forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes
so
    heavily with my disposition that this
 goodly frame, the
earth,
    seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy,
the

    air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this
majestical
    roof fretted with golden 
fire- why, it appeareth no other
thing
    to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours
. What
a
    piece of work is a man! how noble in reason! how infinite in
    faculties! in form 
and moving how express and admirable! in
    action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a g
od! the
    beauty of the world, the paragon of animals! And yet to me
what
    is this quintesse
nce of dust? Man delights not me- no, nor
woman
    neither, though by your smiling you seem to sa
y so.
  Ros. My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.
  Ham. Why did you laugh then, when 
I said 'Man delights not me'?
  Ros. To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten
   
 entertainment the players shall receive from you. We coted
them
    on the way, and hither are th
ey coming to offer you service.
  Ham. He that plays the king shall be welcome- his Majesty shall

    have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil
and
    target; the lover shall 
not sigh gratis; the humorous man
shall
    end his part in peace; the clown shall make those laug
h whose
    lungs are tickle o' th' sere; and the lady shall say her mind
    freely, or the blank
 verse shall halt for't. What players are
    they?
  Ros. Even those you were wont to take such d
elight in, the
    tragedians of the city.
  Ham. How chances it they travel? Their residence, bot
h in
    reputation and profit, was better both ways.
  Ros. I think their inhibition comes by the
 means of the late
    innovation.
  Ham. Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in

the
    city? Are they so follow'd?
  Ros. No indeed are they not.
  Ham. How comes it? Do they 
grow rusty?
  Ros. Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there
is,
    sir, an eyrie
 of children, little eyases, that cry out on the
top
    of question and are most tyrannically cla
pp'd for't. These
are now
    the fashion, and so berattle the common stages (so they call
    th
em) that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goosequills and
    dare scarce come thither.
  Ham. W
hat, are they children? Who maintains 'em? How are they
    escoted? Will they pursue the quality n
o longer than they can
    sing? Will they not say afterwards, if they should grow
    themselves 
to common players (as it is most like, if their
means
    are no better), their writers do them wr
ong to make them
exclaim
    against their own succession.
  Ros. Faith, there has been much to d
o on both sides; and the
nation
    holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy. There was, for

a
    while, no money bid for argument unless the poet and the
player
    went to cuffs in the qu
estion.
  Ham. Is't possible?
  Guil. O, there has been much throwing about of brains.
  Ham. Do 
the boys carry it away?
  Ros. Ay, that they do, my lord- Hercules and his load too.
  Ham. It is 
not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark,
and
    those that would make mows at him while
 my father lived give
    twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his picture
in
    li
ttle. 'Sblood, there is something in this more than
natural, if
    philosophy could find it out.


                     Flourish for the Players.

  Guil. There are the players.
  Ham. Gentleme
n, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come!
Th'
    appurtenance of welcome is fashion and c
eremony. Let me
comply
    with you in this garb, lest my extent to the players (which I
    tell
 you must show fairly outwards) should more appear like
    entertainment than yours. You are welco
me. But my
uncle-father
    and aunt-mother are deceiv'd.
  Guil. In what, my dear lord?
  Ham. 
I am but mad north-north-west. When the wind is southerly
I
    know a hawk from a handsaw.

   
                         Enter Polonius.

  Pol. Well be with you, gentlemen!
  Ham. Hark you, Gu
ildenstern- and you too- at each ear a hearer!
    That great baby you see there is not yet out of 
his swaddling
    clouts.
  Ros. Happily he's the second time come to them; for they say an
old

    man is twice a child.
  Ham. I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players. Mark
it.-
  
 You say right, sir; a Monday morning; twas so indeed.
  Pol. My lord, I have news to tell you.
  
Ham. My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an
actor in
    Rome-
  Pol. The actors a
re come hither, my lord.
  Ham. Buzz, buzz!
  Pol. Upon my honour-
  Ham. Then came each actor on
 his ass-
  Pol. The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy,
    history, pastoral, 
pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral,
    tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastora
l;
scene
    individable, or poem unlimited. Seneca cannot be too heavy,
nor
    Plautus too lig
ht. For the law of writ and the liberty, these
are
    the only men.
  Ham. O Jephthah, judge of 
Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
  Pol. What treasure had he, my lord?
  Ham. Why,

         
'One fair daughter, and no more,
           The which he loved passing well.'

  Pol. [aside] Sti
ll on my daughter.
  Ham. Am I not i' th' right, old Jephthah?
  Pol. If you call me Jephthah, my 
lord, I have a daughter that I
    love passing well.
  Ham. Nay, that follows not.
  Pol. What f
ollows then, my lord?
  Ham. Why,

           'As by lot, God wot,'

 and then, you know,

  
         'It came to pass, as most like it was.'

    The first row of the pious chanson will show
 you more; for
look
    where my abridgment comes.

                     Enter four or five Play
ers.

    You are welcome, masters; welcome, all.- I am glad to see
thee
    well.- Welcome, goo
d friends.- O, my old friend? Why, thy
face is
    valanc'd since I saw thee last. Com'st' thou to
' beard me in
    Denmark?- What, my young lady and mistress? By'r Lady, your
    ladyship is near
er to heaven than when I saw you last by the
    altitude of a chopine. Pray God your voice, like a
 piece of
    uncurrent gold, be not crack'd within the ring.- Masters, you
are
    all welcome. 
We'll e'en to't like French falconers, fly at
    anything we see. We'll have a speech straight. Co
me, give us
a
    taste of your quality. Come, a passionate speech.
  1. Play. What speech, my go
od lord?
  Ham. I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never
acted;
    or if it was, no
t above once; for the play, I remember,
pleas'd
    not the million, 'twas caviary to the general;
 but it was (as
I
    receiv'd it, and others, whose judgments in such matters
cried in
    the 
top of mine) an excellent play, well digested in the
scenes,
    set down with as much modesty as 
cunning. I remember one said
    there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter
savoury,
 
   nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of
    affectation; but call'd it an ho
nest method, as wholesome as
    sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech
in't

    I chiefly lov'd. 'Twas AEneas' tale to Dido, and thereabout
of it
    especially where he spe
aks of Priam's slaughter. If it live
in
    your memory, begin at this line- let me see, let me se
e:

         'The rugged Pyrrhus, like th' Hyrcanian beast-'

    'Tis not so; it begins with Py
rrhus:

         'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
         Black as his purpose, did the
 night resemble
         When he lay couched in the ominous horse,
         Hath now this dread an
d black complexion smear'd
         With heraldry more dismal. Head to foot
         Now is be tot
al gules, horridly trick'd
         With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
         Bak'
d and impasted with the parching streets,
         That lend a tyrannous and a damned light
      
   To their lord's murther. Roasted in wrath and fire,
         And thus o'ersized with coagulate g
ore,
         With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
         Old grandsire Priam seeks.'


    So, proceed you.
  Pol. Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good
     disc
retion.

  1. Play. 'Anon he finds him,
      Striking too short at Greeks. His antique sword,
 
     Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
      Repugnant to command. Unequal match'd,
    
  Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide;
      But with the whiff and wind of his fell swor
d
      Th' unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
      Seeming to feel this blow, with fla
ming top
      Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
      Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear. For
 lo! his sword,
      Which was declining on the milky head
      Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' th'
 air to stick.
      So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
      And, like a neutral to his will
 and matter,
      Did nothing.
      But, as we often see, against some storm,
      A silence i
n the heavens, the rack stand still,
      The bold winds speechless, and the orb below
      As h
ush as death- anon the dreadful thunder
      Doth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
    
  Aroused vengeance sets him new awork;
      And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
      On Mar
s's armour, forg'd for proof eterne,
      With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
      No
w falls on Priam.
      Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods,
      In general synod take
 away her power;
      Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
      And bowl the round n
ave down the hill of heaven,
      As low as to the fiends!

  Pol. This is too long.
  Ham. It 
shall to the barber's, with your beard.- Prithee say
on.
    He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, o
r he sleeps. Say on;
come to
    Hecuba.

  1. Play. 'But who, O who, had seen the mobled queen-
'

  Ham. 'The mobled queen'?
  Pol. That's good! 'Mobled queen' is good.

  1. Play. 'Run bare
foot up and down, threat'ning the flames
      With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head
      Whe
re late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
      About her lank and all o'erteemed loins,
      A b
lanket, in the alarm of fear caught up-
      Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd
    
  'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have pronounc'd.
      But if the gods themselves did see h
er then,
      When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
      In Mincing with his sword her husba
nd's limbs,
      The instant burst of clamour that she made
      (Unless things mortal move them
 not at all)
      Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven
      And passion in the gods.
'

  Pol. Look, whe'r he has not turn'd his colour, and has tears
in's
    eyes. Prithee no more
!
  Ham. 'Tis well. I'll have thee speak out the rest of this
soon.-
    Good my lord, will you s
ee the players well bestow'd? Do you
    hear? Let them be well us'd; for they are the abstract and

brief
    chronicles of the time. After your death you were better have
a
    bad epitaph than 
their ill report while you live.
  Pol. My lord, I will use them according to their desert.
  Ham.
 God's bodykins, man, much better! Use every man after his
    desert, and who should scape whippin
g? Use them after your
own
    honour and dignity. The less they deserve, the more merit is
in
 
   your bounty. Take them in.
  Pol. Come, sirs.
  Ham. Follow him, friends. We'll hear a play to-
morrow.
                 Exeunt Polonius and Players [except the First].
    Dost thou hear me, ol
d friend? Can you play 'The Murther of
    Gonzago'?
  1. Play. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. We'll ha't to
-morrow night. You could, for a need, study a
    speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which I wou
ld set down
and
    insert in't, could you not?
  1. Play. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Very well. Follow
 that lord- and look you mock him not.
                                            [Exit First Play
er.]
    My good friends, I'll leave you till night. You are welcome
to
    Elsinore.
  Ros. Goo
d my lord!
  Ham. Ay, so, God b' wi' ye!
                            [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guild
enstern
    Now I am alone.
    O what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
    Is it not monstrous th
at this player here,
    But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
    Could force his soul so to h
is own conceit
    That, from her working, all his visage wann'd,
    Tears in his eyes, distracti
on in's aspect,
    A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
    With forms to his conceit? 
And all for nothing!
    For Hecuba!
    What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
    That he shoul
d weep for her? What would he do,
    Had he the motive and the cue for passion
    That I have? H
e would drown the stage with tears
    And cleave the general ear with horrid speech;
    Make mad
 the guilty and appal the free,
    Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed
    The very faculties
 of eyes and ears.
    Yet I,
    A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak
    Like John-a-dreams, u
npregnant of my cause,
    And can say nothing! No, not for a king,
    Upon whose property and mo
st dear life
    A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
    Who calls me villain? breaks my pate
 across?
    Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?
    Tweaks me by th' nose? gives me the 
lie i' th' throat
    As deep as to the lungs? Who does me this, ha?
    'Swounds, I should take i
t! for it cannot be
    But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall
    To make oppression bitter, or er
e this
    I should have fatted all the region kites
    With this slave's offal. Bloody bawdy vil
lain!
    Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
    O, vengeance!
    Why, what 
an ass am I! This is most brave,
    That I, the son of a dear father murther'd,
    Prompted to m
y revenge by heaven and hell,
    Must (like a whore) unpack my heart with words
    And fall a-cu
rsing like a very drab,
    A scullion!
    Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! Hum, I have heard
 
   That guilty creatures, sitting at a play,
    Have by the very cunning of the scene
    Been st
ruck so to the soul that presently
    They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
    For murther, t
hough it have no tongue, will speak
    With most miraculous organ, I'll have these Players
    Pl
ay something like the murther of my father
    Before mine uncle. I'll observe his looks;
    I'll
 tent him to the quick. If he but blench,
    I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
    Ma
y be a devil; and the devil hath power
    T' assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
    Out of
 my weakness and my melancholy,
    As he is very potent with such spirits,
    Abuses me to damn 
me. I'll have grounds
    More relative than this. The play's the thing
    Wherein I'll catch the
 conscience of the King.         Exit.

ACT III. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in t
he Castle.

Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern,
and Lords.

  King
. And can you by no drift of circumstance
    Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
    Grat
ing so harshly all his days of quiet
    With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
  Ros. He does confe
ss he feels himself distracted,
    But from what cause he will by no means speak.
  Guil. Nor do 
we find him forward to be sounded,
    But with a crafty madness keeps aloof
    When we would bri
ng him on to some confession
    Of his true state.
  Queen. Did he receive you well?
  Ros. Most
 like a gentleman.
  Guil. But with much forcing of his disposition.
  Ros. Niggard of question, b
ut of our demands
    Most free in his reply.
  Queen. Did you assay him
    To any pastime?
  R
os. Madam, it so fell out that certain players
    We o'erraught on the way. Of these we told him,

    And there did seem in him a kind of joy
    To hear of it. They are here about the court,
   
 And, as I think, they have already order
    This night to play before him.
  Pol. 'Tis most true
;
    And he beseech'd me to entreat your Majesties
    To hear and see the matter.
  King. With 
all my heart, and it doth much content me
    To hear him so inclin'd.
    Good gentlemen, give hi
m a further edge
    And drive his purpose on to these delights.
  Ros. We shall, my lord.
      
                      Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
  King. Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
 
   For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
    That he, as 'twere by accident, may here
    Af
front Ophelia.
    Her father and myself (lawful espials)
    Will so bestow ourselves that, seein
g unseen,
    We may of their encounter frankly judge
    And gather by him, as he is behav'd,
  
  If't be th' affliction of his love, or no,
    That thus he suffers for.
  Queen. I shall obey y
ou;
    And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
    That your good beauties be the happy cause
    
Of Hamlet's wildness. So shall I hope your virtues
    Will bring him to his wonted way again,
   
 To both your honours.
  Oph. Madam, I wish it may.
                                              
     [Exit Queen.]
  Pol. Ophelia, walk you here.- Gracious, so please you,
    We will bestow our
selves.- [To Ophelia] Read on this book,
    That show of such an exercise may colour
    Your lon
eliness.- We are oft to blame in this,
    'Tis too much prov'd, that with devotion's visage
    A
nd pious action we do sugar o'er
    The Devil himself.
  King. [aside] O, 'tis too true!
    How
 smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
    The harlot's cheek, beautied with plast'ring
 art,
    Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
    Than is my deed to my most painted word.

    O heavy burthen!
  Pol. I hear him coming. Let's withdraw, my lord.
                        
              Exeunt King and Polonius].

                           Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. To be
, or not to be- that is the question:
    Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
    The slings
 and arrows of outrageous fortune
    Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
    And by opposi
ng end them. To die- to sleep-
    No more; and by a sleep to say we end
    The heartache, and th
e thousand natural shocks
    That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation
    Devoutly to be wish'd
. To die- to sleep.
    To sleep- perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub!
    For in that sleep o
f death what dreams may come
    When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
    Must give us paus
e. There's the respect
    That makes calamity of so long life.
    For who would bear the whips a
nd scorns of time,
    Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
    The pangs of despis'd
 love, the law's delay,
    The insolence of office, and the spurns
    That patient merit of th' 
unworthy takes,
    When he himself might his quietus make
    With a bare bodkin? Who would these
 fardels bear,
    To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
    But that the dread of something afte
r death-
    The undiscover'd country, from whose bourn
    No traveller returns- puzzles the will
,
    And makes us rather bear those ills we have
    Than fly to others that we know not of?
   
 Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
    And thus the native hue of resolution
    Is sic
klied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
    And enterprises of great pith and moment
    With th
is regard their currents turn awry
    And lose the name of action.- Soft you now!
    The fair Op
helia!- Nymph, in thy orisons
    Be all my sins rememb'red.
  Oph. Good my lord,
    How does yo
ur honour for this many a day?
  Ham. I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
  Oph. My lord, I have
 remembrances of yours
    That I have longed long to re-deliver.
    I pray you, now receive them
.
  Ham. No, not I!
    I never gave you aught.
  Oph. My honour'd lord, you know right well you 
did,
    And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd
    As made the things more rich. Their p
erfume lost,
    Take these again; for to the noble mind
    Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove
 unkind.
    There, my lord.
  Ham. Ha, ha! Are you honest?
  Oph. My lord?
  Ham. Are you fair?

  Oph. What means your lordship?
  Ham. That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit

no
    discourse to your beauty.
  Oph. Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with
h
onesty?
  Ham. Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform
    honesty from what it i
s to a bawd than the force of honesty
can
    translate beauty into his likeness. This was sometim
e a
paradox,
    but now the time gives it proof. I did love you once.
  Oph. Indeed, my lord, yo
u made me believe so.
  Ham. You should not have believ'd me; for virtue cannot so
    inoculate o
ur old stock but we shall relish of it. I loved
you
    not.
  Oph. I was the more deceived.
  H
am. Get thee to a nunnery! Why wouldst thou be a breeder of
    sinners? I am myself indifferent ho
nest, but yet I could
accuse
    me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne
me
.
    I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more offences at
my
    beck than I have thoug
hts to put them in, imagination to give
    them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fe
llows
as I
    do, crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves
all;
    believe none
 of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where's your
    father?
  Oph. At home, my lord.
  Ham. Let th
e doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool
    nowhere but in's own house. Farewell.
  Op
h. O, help him, you sweet heavens!
  Ham. If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy
d
owry:
    be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not
escape
    calumny. Get thee 
to a nunnery. Go, farewell. Or if thou wilt
    needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well e
nough what
    monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go; and quickly too.
    Farewell.
  Oph.
 O heavenly powers, restore him!
  Ham. I have heard of your paintings too, well enough. God hath

    given you one face, and you make yourselves another. You jig,
you
    amble, and you lisp; you
 nickname God's creatures and make
your
    wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't! i
t hath
made
    me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages. Those that are
    married already
- all but one- shall live; the rest shall keep
as
    they are. To a nunnery, go.                 
           Exit.
  Oph. O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
    The courtier's, scholar's, so
ldier's, eye, tongue, sword,
    Th' expectancy and rose of the fair state,
    The glass of fashi
on and the mould of form,
    Th' observ'd of all observers- quite, quite down!
    And I, of ladi
es most deject and wretched,
    That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
    Now see that noble a
nd most sovereign reason,
    Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
    That unmatch'd 
form and feature of blown youth
    Blasted with ecstasy. O, woe is me
    T' have seen what I hav
e seen, see what I see!

                   Enter King and Polonius.

  King. Love? his affectio
ns do not that way tend;
    Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,
    Was not like m
adness. There's something in his soul
    O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
    And I do do
ubt the hatch and the disclose
    Will be some danger; which for to prevent,
    I have in quick 
determination
    Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England
    For the demand of our negle
cted tribute.
    Haply the seas, and countries different,
    With variable objects, shall expel

    This something-settled matter in his heart,
    Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus

    From fashion of himself. What think you on't?
  Pol. It shall do well. But yet do I believe

    The origin and commencement of his grief
    Sprung from neglected love.- How now, Ophelia?
  
  You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said.
    We heard it all.- My lord, do as you please;
   
 But if you hold it fit, after the play
    Let his queen mother all alone entreat him
    To show
 his grief. Let her be round with him;
    And I'll be plac'd so please you, in the ear
    Of all
 their conference. If she find him not,
    To England send him; or confine him where
    Your wis
dom best shall think.
  King. It shall be so.
    Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.    
     Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. hall in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet and three of the Play
ers.

  Ham. Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounc'd it to you,
    trippingly on the tongu
e. But if you mouth it, as many of our
    players do, I had as live the town crier spoke my lines.
 Nor
do
    not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all
    gently; for in the ver
y torrent, tempest, and (as I may say)
    whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and beget a

    temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to
the
    soul to hear a robustious
 periwig-pated fellow tear a passion
to
    tatters, to very rags, to split the cars of the ground
lings,
who
    (for the most part) are capable of nothing but inexplicable
dumb
    shows and no
ise. I would have such a fellow whipp'd for
o'erdoing
    Termagant. It out-herods Herod. Pray you
 avoid it.
  Player. I warrant your honour.
  Ham. Be not too tame neither; but let your own discr
etion be
your
    tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the action;
with
    this spec
ial observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of
    nature: for anything so overdone is from t
he purpose of
playing,
    whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as
    'twe
re, the mirror up to nature; to show Virtue her own
feature,
    scorn her own image, and the very
 age and body of the time
his
    form and pressure. Now this overdone, or come tardy off,
though

    it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious
    grieve; the censure of the whi
ch one must in your allowance
    o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that
I

    have seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly (not
to
    speak it profanely), tha
t, neither having the accent of
    Christians, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have
so

    strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of Nature's
    journeymen had made men, and n
ot made them well, they
imitated
    humanity so abominably.
  Player. I hope we have reform'd th
at indifferently with us,
sir.
  Ham. O, reform it altogether! And let those that play your
clown
s
    speak no more than is set down for them. For there be of them
    that will themselves laugh
, to set on some quantity of barren
    spectators to laugh too, though in the mean time some
nece
ssary
    question of the play be then to be considered. That's
villanous
    and shows a most pi
tiful ambition in the fool that uses it.
Go
    make you ready.
                                 
                Exeunt Players.

            Enter Polonius, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.

   
 How now, my lord? Will the King hear this piece of work?
  Pol. And the Queen too, and that presen
tly.
  Ham. Bid the players make haste, [Exit Polonius.] Will you two
    help to hasten them?
  
Both. We will, my lord.                       Exeunt they two.
  Ham. What, ho, Horatio!

       
               Enter Horatio.

  Hor. Here, sweet lord, at your service.
  Ham. Horatio, thou art
 e'en as just a man
    As e'er my conversation cop'd withal.
  Hor. O, my dear lord!
  Ham. Nay,
 do not think I flatter;
    For what advancement may I hope from thee,
    That no revenue hast b
ut thy good spirits
    To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
    No, let the
 candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
    And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
    Where thrift m
ay follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
    Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
    And could
 of men distinguish, her election
    Hath seal'd thee for herself. For thou hast been
    As one,
 in suff'ring all, that suffers nothing;
    A man that Fortune's buffets and rewards
    Hast ta'
en with equal thanks; and blest are those
    Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled
    
That they are not a pipe for Fortune's finger
    To sound what stop she please. Give me that man

    That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
    In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of hea
rt,
    As I do thee. Something too much of this I
    There is a play to-night before the King.

    One scene of it comes near the circumstance,
    Which I have told thee, of my father's death.

    I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
    Even with the very comment of thy soul
    Obs
erve my uncle. If his occulted guilt
    Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
    It is a damned 
ghost that we have seen,
    And my imaginations are as foul
    As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heed
ful note;
    For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,
    And after we will both our judgments joi
n
    In censure of his seeming.
  Hor. Well, my lord.
    If he steal aught the whilst this play
 is playing,
    And scape detecting, I will pay the theft.

    Sound a flourish. [Enter Trumpet
s and Kettledrums. Danish
    march. [Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz,
      Gui
ldenstern, and other Lords attendant, with the Guard
                       carrying torches.

  
Ham. They are coming to the play. I must be idle.
    Get you a place.
  King. How fares our cousi
n Hamlet?
  Ham. Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish. I eat the
air,
    promise-cramm'd
. You cannot feed capons so.
  King. I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet. These words are
not

    mine.
  Ham. No, nor mine now. [To Polonius] My lord, you play'd once
    i' th' university, 
you say?
  Pol. That did I, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.
  Ham. What did you enact?
 
 Pol. I did enact Julius Caesar; I was kill'd i' th' Capitol;
Brutus
    kill'd me.
  Ham. It was
 a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf
there. Be
    the players ready.
  Ros. Ay, my lor
d. They stay upon your patience.
  Queen. Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
  Ham. No, good 
mother. Here's metal more attractive.
  Pol. [to the King] O, ho! do you mark that?
  Ham. Lady, s
hall I lie in your lap?
                                  [Sits down at Ophelia's feet.]

  Oph. 
No, my lord.
  Ham. I mean, my head upon your lap?
  Oph. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Do you think I mean
t country matters?
  Oph. I think nothing, my lord.
  Ham. That's a fair thought to lie between ma
ids' legs.
  Oph. What is, my lord?
  Ham. Nothing.
  Oph. You are merry, my lord.
  Ham. Who, I
?
  Oph. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. O God, your only jig-maker! What should a man do but be
merry?
    
For look you how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father
died
    within 's two hours.
  Oph. N
ay 'tis twice two months, my lord.
  Ham. So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I'll hav
e
a
    suit of sables. O heavens! die two months ago, and not
forgotten
    yet? Then there's h
ope a great man's memory may outlive his
life
    half a year. But, by'r Lady, he must build churc
hes then; or
else
    shall he suffer not thinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose

    epitaph 
is 'For O, for O, the hobby-horse is forgot!'

               Hautboys play. The dumb show enters.


    Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing
    him and he her. She kneels,
 and makes show of protestation
    unto him. He takes her up, and declines his head upon her
    
neck. He lays him down upon a bank of flowers. She, seeing
    him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes i
n a fellow, takes off his
    crown, kisses it, pours poison in the sleeper's ears, and
    leaves
 him. The Queen returns, finds the King dead, and makes
    passionate action. The Poisoner with so
me three or four
Mutes,
    comes in again, seem to condole with her. The dead body is
    carrie
d away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with gifts; she
    seems harsh and unwilling awhile, but in t
he end accepts
    his love.
                                                         Exeunt.

 
 Oph. What means this, my lord?
  Ham. Marry, this is miching malhecho; it means mischief.
  Oph. 
Belike this show imports the argument of the play.

                      Enter Prologue.

  Ham
. We shall know by this fellow. The players cannot keep
counsel;
    they'll tell all.
  Oph. Wil
l he tell us what this show meant?
  Ham. Ay, or any show that you'll show him. Be not you asham'd

to
    show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means.
  Oph. You are naught, you are naught! I'
ll mark the play.

    Pro. For us, and for our tragedy,
      Here stooping to your clemency,
 
     We beg your hearing patiently.                     [Exit.]

  Ham. Is this a prologue, or the
 posy of a ring?
  Oph. 'Tis brief, my lord.
  Ham. As woman's love.

              Enter [two P
layers as] King and Queen.

    King. Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round
      Neptu
ne's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
      And thirty dozen moons with borrowed sheen
      Ab
out the world have times twelve thirties been,
      Since love our hearts, and Hymen did our hands
,
      Unite comutual in most sacred bands.
    Queen. So many journeys may the sun and moon
   
   Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
      But woe is me! you are so sick of late,
      
So far from cheer and from your former state.
      That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
 
     Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must;
      For women's fear and love holds quantity,
   
   In neither aught, or in extremity.
      Now what my love is, proof hath made you know;
      A
nd as my love is siz'd, my fear is so.
      Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
  
    Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.
    King. Faith, I must leave thee, love
, and shortly too;
      My operant powers their functions leave to do.
      And thou shalt live 
in this fair world behind,
      Honour'd, belov'd, and haply one as kind
      For husband shalt 
thou-
    Queen. O, confound the rest!
      Such love must needs be treason in my breast.
      
When second husband let me be accurst!
      None wed the second but who killed the first.

  Ham
. [aside] Wormwood, wormwood!

    Queen. The instances that second marriage move
      Are base 
respects of thrift, but none of love.
      A second time I kill my husband dead
      When second
 husband kisses me in bed.
    King. I do believe you think what now you speak;
      But what we 
do determine oft we break.
      Purpose is but the slave to memory,
      Of violent birth, but p
oor validity;
      Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree,
      But fall unshaken when
 they mellow be.
      Most necessary 'tis that we forget
      To pay ourselves what to ourselves
 is debt.
      What to ourselves in passion we propose,
      The passion ending, doth the purpos
e lose.
      The violence of either grief or joy
      Their own enactures with themselves destro
y.
      Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
      Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender 
accident.
      This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
      That even our loves should w
ith our fortunes change;
      For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
      Whether love lead f
ortune, or else fortune love.
      The great man down, you mark his favourite flies,
      The po
or advanc'd makes friends of enemies;
      And hitherto doth love on fortune tend,
      For who 
not needs shall never lack a friend,
      And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
      Directl
y seasons him his enemy.
      But, orderly to end where I begun,
      Our wills and fates do so 
contrary run
      That our devices still are overthrown;
      Our thoughts are ours, their ends 
none of our own.
      So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
      But die thy thoughts when t
hy first lord is dead.
    Queen. Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light,
      Sport and rep
ose lock from me day and night,
      To desperation turn my trust and hope,
      An anchor's che
er in prison be my scope,
      Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
      Meet what I would 
have well, and it destroy,
      Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
      If, once a wi
dow, ever I be wife!

  Ham. If she should break it now!

    King. 'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, le
ave me here awhile.
      My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile
      The tedious day wit
h sleep.
    Queen. Sleep rock thy brain,
                                                    [He]
 sleeps.
      And never come mischance between us twain!
Exit.

  Ham. Madam, how like you this
 play?
  Queen. The lady doth protest too much, methinks.
  Ham. O, but she'll keep her word.
  K
ing. Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in't?
  Ham. No, no! They do but jest, poison
 in jest; no offence i'
th'
    world.
  King. What do you call the play?
  Ham. 'The Mousetrap.
' Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the
    image of a murther done in Vienna. Gonzago is the du
ke's
name;
    his wife, Baptista. You shall see anon. 'Tis a knavish piece
of
    work; but wha
t o' that? Your Majesty, and we that have free
    souls, it touches us not. Let the gall'd jade wi
nch; our
withers
    are unwrung.

                         Enter Lucianus.

    This is one L
ucianus, nephew to the King.
  Oph. You are as good as a chorus, my lord.
  Ham. I could interpret
 between you and your love, if I could
see
    the puppets dallying.
  Oph. You are keen, my lord
, you are keen.
  Ham. It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
  Oph. Still better, and 
worse.
  Ham. So you must take your husbands.- Begin, murtherer. Pox,
leave
    thy damnable face
s, and begin! Come, the croaking raven doth
    bellow for revenge.

    Luc. Thoughts black, han
ds apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
      Confederate season, else no creature seeing;
      Tho
u mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,
      With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infecte
d,
      Thy natural magic and dire property
      On wholesome life usurp immediately.
         
                          Pours the poison in his ears.

  Ham. He poisons him i' th' garden for's
 estate. His name's
Gonzago.
    The story is extant, and written in very choice Italian. You
   
 shall see anon how the murtherer gets the love of Gonzago's
wife.
  Oph. The King rises.
  Ham. 
What, frighted with false fire?
  Queen. How fares my lord?
  Pol. Give o'er the play.
  King. Gi
ve me some light! Away!
  All. Lights, lights, lights!
                              Exeunt all bu
t Hamlet and Horatio.
  Ham.   Why, let the strucken deer go weep,
          The hart ungalled pla
y;
         For some must watch, while some must sleep:
          Thus runs the world away.
    W
ould not this, sir, and a forest of feathers- if the rest of
my
    fortunes turn Turk with me-wit
h two Provincial roses on my
raz'd
    shoes, get me a fellowship in a cry of players, sir?
  Hor
. Half a share.
  Ham.   A whole one I!
         For thou dost know, O Damon dear,
           Thi
s realm dismantled was
         Of Jove himself; and now reigns here
           A very, very- pajo
ck.
  Hor. You might have rhym'd.
  Ham. O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand

    pound! Didst perceive?
  Hor. Very well, my lord.
  Ham. Upon the talk of the poisoning?
  
Hor. I did very well note him.
  Ham.   Aha! Come, some music! Come, the recorders!
         For i
f the King like not the comedy,
         Why then, belike he likes it not, perdy.
    Come, some m
usic!

                Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Guil. Good my lord, vouchsafe me a
 word with you.
  Ham. Sir, a whole history.
  Guil. The King, sir-
  Ham. Ay, sir, what of him?

  Guil. Is in his retirement, marvellous distemper'd.
  Ham. With drink, sir?
  Guil. No, my lord
; rather with choler.
  Ham. Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this
to
    th
e doctor; for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps
    plunge him into far more choler.
  
Guil. Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame, and
start
    not so wildly from my affair
.
  Ham. I am tame, sir; pronounce.
  Guil. The Queen, your mother, in most great affliction of
s
pirit
    hath sent me to you.
  Ham. You are welcome.
  Guil. Nay, good my lord, this courtesy i
s not of the right
breed.
    If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, I will
do
  
  your mother's commandment; if not, your pardon and my return
    shall be the end of my business.

  Ham. Sir, I cannot.
  Guil. What, my lord?
  Ham. Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseas
'd. But, sir,
such
    answer as I can make, you shall command; or rather, as you
say,
    my mo
ther. Therefore no more, but to the matter! My mother,
you
    say-
  Ros. Then thus she says: yo
ur behaviour hath struck her into
    amazement and admiration.
  Ham. O wonderful son, that can s
o stonish a mother! But is
there no
    sequel at the heels of this mother's admiration? Impart.

  Ros. She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to
bed.
  Ham. We shall obey, were s
he ten times our mother. Have you any
    further trade with us?
  Ros. My lord, you once did love
 me.
  Ham. And do still, by these pickers and stealers!
  Ros. Good my lord, what is your cause o
f distemper? You do
surely
    bar the door upon your own liberty, if you deny your griefs
to
  
  your friend.
  Ham. Sir, I lack advancement.
  Ros. How can that be, when you have the voice of 
the King
himself
    for your succession in Denmark?
  Ham. Ay, sir, but 'while the grass grows'-
 the proverb is
something
    musty.

                     Enter the Players with recorders.


    O, the recorders! Let me see one. To withdraw with you- why
do
    you go about to recover the
 wind of me, as if you would drive
me
    into a toil?
  Guil. O my lord, if my duty be too bold,
 my love is too
unmannerly.
  Ham. I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this
pipe?

  Guil. My lord, I cannot.
  Ham. I pray you.
  Guil. Believe me, I cannot.
  Ham. I do beseech y
ou.
  Guil. I know, no touch of it, my lord.
  Ham. It is as easy as lying. Govern these ventages 
with your
    fingers and thumbs, give it breath with your mouth, and it
will
    discourse most 
eloquent music. Look you, these are the stops.
  Guil. But these cannot I command to any utt'rance 
of harmony. I
    have not the skill.
  Ham. Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of m
e!
You
    would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you
would
    pluck out the hear
t of my mystery; you would sound me from my
    lowest note to the top of my compass; and there is 
much
music,
    excellent voice, in this little organ, yet cannot you make it
    speak. 'Sblood,
 do you think I am easier to be play'd on than
a
    pipe? Call me what instrument you will, thoug
h you can fret
me,
    you cannot play upon me.

                        Enter Polonius.

    
God bless you, sir!
  Pol. My lord, the Queen would speak with you, and presently.
  Ham. Do you s
ee yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
  Pol. By th' mass, and 'tis like a camel indeed
.
  Ham. Methinks it is like a weasel.
  Pol. It is back'd like a weasel.
  Ham. Or like a whale.

  Pol. Very like a whale.
  Ham. Then will I come to my mother by-and-by.- They fool me to
the

    top of my bent.- I will come by-and-by.
  Pol. I will say so.                                  
    Exit.
  Ham. 'By-and-by' is easily said.- Leave me, friends.
                                 
       [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]

    'Tis now the very witching time of night,
    When churchyar
ds yawn, and hell itself breathes out
    Contagion to this world. Now could I drink hot blood
   
 And do such bitter business as the day
    Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother!
    O 
heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever
    The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom.
    Let me be
 cruel, not unnatural;
    I will speak daggers to her, but use none.
    My tongue and soul in th
is be hypocrites-
    How in my words somever she be shent,
    To give them seals never, my soul,
 consent!             Exit.




Scene III.
A room in the Castle.

Enter King, Rosencrantz, a
nd Guildenstern.

  King. I like him not, nor stands it safe with us
    To let his madness range
. Therefore prepare you;
    I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
    And he to England shal
l along with you.
    The terms of our estate may not endure
    Hazard so near us as doth hourly 
grow
    Out of his lunacies.
  Guil. We will ourselves provide.
    Most holy and religious fear
 it is
    To keep those many many bodies safe
    That live and feed upon your Majesty.
  Ros. T
he single and peculiar life is bound
    With all the strength and armour of the mind
    To keep 
itself from noyance; but much more
    That spirit upon whose weal depends and rests
    The lives
 of many. The cesse of majesty
    Dies not alone, but like a gulf doth draw
    What's near it wi
th it. It is a massy wheel,
    Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,
    To whose huge spokes
 ten thousand lesser things
    Are mortis'd and adjoin'd; which when it falls,
    Each small ann
exment, petty consequence,
    Attends the boist'rous ruin. Never alone
    Did the king sigh, but
 with a general groan.
  King. Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;
    For we will fetters
 put upon this fear,
    Which now goes too free-footed.
  Both. We will haste us.
              
                                 Exeunt Gentlemen.

                   Enter Polonius.

  Pol. M
y lord, he's going to his mother's closet.
    Behind the arras I'll convey myself
    To hear the
 process. I'll warrant she'll tax him home;
    And, as you said, and wisely was it said,
    'Tis
 meet that some more audience than a mother,
    Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear

    The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege.
    I'll call upon you ere you go to bed
    
And tell you what I know.
  King. Thanks, dear my lord.
                                          
      Exit [Polonius].
    O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven;
    It hath the primal elde
st curse upon't,
    A brother's murther! Pray can I not,
    Though inclination be as sharp as wi
ll.
    My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent,
    And, like a man to double business bound,

    I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
    And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
  
  Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,
    Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens

    To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
    But to confront the visage of offence?
   
 And what's in prayer but this twofold force,
    To be forestalled ere we come to fall,
    Or pa
rdon'd being down? Then I'll look up;
    My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer
    Can se
rve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murther'?
    That cannot be; since I am still possess'd
    Of t
hose effects for which I did the murther-
    My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.
    May o
ne be pardon'd and retain th' offence?
    In the corrupted currents of this world
    Offence's g
ilded hand may shove by justice,
    And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
    Buys out the la
w; but 'tis not so above.
    There is no shuffling; there the action lies
    In his true nature,
 and we ourselves compell'd,
    Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
    To give in evid
ence. What then? What rests?
    Try what repentance can. What can it not?
    Yet what can it whe
n one cannot repent?
    O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
    O limed soul, that, struggl
ing to be free,
    Art more engag'd! Help, angels! Make assay.
    Bow, stubborn knees; and heart
 with strings of steel,
    Be soft as sinews of the new-born babe!
    All may be well.          
                        He kneels.

                         Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Now might I d
o it pat, now he is praying;
    And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven,
    And so am I reve
ng'd. That would be scann'd.
    A villain kills my father; and for that,
    I, his sole son, do 
this same villain send
    To heaven.
    Why, this is hire and salary, not revenge!
    He took 
my father grossly, full of bread,
    With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
    And ho
w his audit stands, who knows save heaven?
    But in our circumstance and course of thought,
    
'Tis heavy with him; and am I then reveng'd,
    To take him in the purging of his soul,
    When 
he is fit and seasoned for his passage?
    No.
    Up, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent.

    When he is drunk asleep; or in his rage;
    Or in th' incestuous pleasure of his bed;
    At 
gaming, swearing, or about some act
    That has no relish of salvation in't-
    Then trip him, t
hat his heels may kick at heaven,
    And that his soul may be as damn'd and black
    As hell, wh
ereto it goes. My mother stays.
    This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.              Exit.
 
 King. [rises] My words fly up, my thoughts remain below.
    Words without thoughts never to heave
n go.             Exit.




Scene IV.
The Queen's closet.

Enter Queen and Polonius.

  Po
l. He will come straight. Look you lay home to him.
    Tell him his pranks have been too broad to 
bear with,
    And that your Grace hath screen'd and stood between
    Much heat and him. I'll sil
ence me even here.
    Pray you be round with him.
  Ham. (within) Mother, mother, mother!
  Quee
n. I'll warrant you; fear me not. Withdraw; I hear him
coming.
                              [Polo
nius hides behind the arras.]

                          Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Now, mother, what
's the matter?
  Queen. Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
  Ham. Mother, you have my fat
her much offended.
  Queen. Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
  Ham. Go, go, you questio
n with a wicked tongue.
  Queen. Why, how now, Hamlet?
  Ham. What's the matter now?
  Queen. Hav
e you forgot me?
  Ham. No, by the rood, not so!
    You are the Queen, your husband's brother's w
ife,
    And (would it were not so!) you are my mother.
  Queen. Nay, then I'll set those to you t
hat can speak.
  Ham. Come, come, and sit you down. You shall not budge;
    You go not till I set
 you up a glass
    Where you may see the inmost part of you.
  Queen. What wilt thou do? Thou wil
t not murther me?
    Help, help, ho!
  Pol. [behind] What, ho! help, help, help!
  Ham. [draws] 
How now? a rat? Dead for a ducat, dead!
            [Makes a pass through the arras and] kills Polo
nius.
  Pol. [behind] O, I am slain!
  Queen. O me, what hast thou done?
  Ham. Nay, I know not. 
Is it the King?
  Queen. O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
  Ham. A bloody deed- almost as b
ad, good mother,
    As kill a king, and marry with his brother.
  Queen. As kill a king?
  Ham. 
Ay, lady, it was my word.
                         [Lifts up the arras and sees Polonius.]
    Tho
u wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
    I took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune.
    
Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.
    Leave wringing of your hands. Peace! sit you down

    And let me wring your heart; for so I shall
    If it be made of penetrable stuff;
    If damn
ed custom have not braz'd it so
    That it is proof and bulwark against sense.
  Queen. What have
 I done that thou dar'st wag thy tongue
    In noise so rude against me?
  Ham. Such an act
    T
hat blurs the grace and blush of modesty;
    Calls virtue hypocrite; takes off the rose
    From 
the fair forehead of an innocent love,
    And sets a blister there; makes marriage vows
    As fa
lse as dicers' oaths. O, such a deed
    As from the body of contraction plucks
    The very soul,
 and sweet religion makes
    A rhapsody of words! Heaven's face doth glow;
    Yea, this solidity
 and compound mass,
    With tristful visage, as against the doom,
    Is thought-sick at the act.

  Queen. Ah me, what act,
    That roars so loud and thunders in the index?
  Ham. Look here upo
n th's picture, and on this,
    The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
    See what a grace
 was seated on this brow;
    Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
    An eye like Mars, t
o threaten and command;
    A station like the herald Mercury
    New lighted on a heaven-kissing 
hill:
    A combination and a form indeed
    Where every god did seem to set his seal
    To giv
e the world assurance of a man.
    This was your husband. Look you now what follows.
    Here is 
your husband, like a mildew'd ear
    Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
    Could you
 on this fair mountain leave to feed,
    And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes
    You canno
t call it love; for at your age
    The heyday in the blood is tame, it's humble,
    And waits up
on the judgment; and what judgment
    Would step from this to this? Sense sure you have,
    Else
 could you not have motion; but sure that sense
    Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,
    N
or sense to ecstacy was ne'er so thrall'd
    But it reserv'd some quantity of choice
    To serve
 in such a difference. What devil was't
    That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
    Eyes 
without feeling, feeling without sight,
    Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
    Or 
but a sickly part of one true sense
    Could not so mope.
    O shame! where is thy blush? Rebell
ious hell,
    If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
    To flaming youth let virtue be as wax

    And melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame
    When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,

    Since frost itself as actively doth burn,
    And reason panders will.
  Queen. O Hamlet, spe
ak no more!
    Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul,
    And there I see such black and grain
ed spots
    As will not leave their tinct.
  Ham. Nay, but to live
    In the rank sweat of an e
nseamed bed,
    Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love
    Over the nasty sty!
  Queen. 
O, speak to me no more!
    These words like daggers enter in mine ears.
    No more, sweet Hamlet
!
  Ham. A murtherer and a villain!
    A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
    Of your 
precedent lord; a vice of kings;
    A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
    That from a shelf 
the precious diadem stole
    And put it in his pocket!
  Queen. No more!

                Enter
 the Ghost in his nightgown.

  Ham. A king of shreds and patches!-
    Save me and hover o'er me
 with your wings,
    You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?
  Queen. Alas, he's ma
d!
  Ham. Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
    That, laps'd in time and passion, lets go b
y
    Th' important acting of your dread command?
    O, say!
  Ghost. Do not forget. This visita
tion
    Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
    But look, amazement on thy mother sits.
 
   O, step between her and her fighting soul
    Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works.
    Sp
eak to her, Hamlet.
  Ham. How is it with you, lady?
  Queen. Alas, how is't with you,
    That y
ou do bend your eye on vacancy,
    And with th' encorporal air do hold discourse?
    Forth at yo
ur eyes your spirits wildly peep;
    And, as the sleeping soldiers in th' alarm,
    Your bedded 
hairs, like life in excrements,
    Start up and stand an end. O gentle son,
    Upon the heat and
 flame of thy distemper
    Sprinkle cool patience! Whereon do you look?
  Ham. On him, on him! Lo
ok you how pale he glares!
    His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
    Would make t
hem capable.- Do not look upon me,
    Lest with this piteous action you convert
    My stern effe
cts. Then what I have to do
    Will want true colour- tears perchance for blood.
  Queen. To whom
 do you speak this?
  Ham. Do you see nothing there?
  Queen. Nothing at all; yet all that is I se
e.
  Ham. Nor did you nothing hear?
  Queen. No, nothing but ourselves.
  Ham. Why, look you ther
e! Look how it steals away!
    My father, in his habit as he liv'd!
    Look where he goes even n
ow out at the portal!
                                                     Exit Ghost.
  Queen. Th
is is the very coinage of your brain.
    This bodiless creation ecstasy
    Is very cunning in.

  Ham. Ecstasy?
    My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time
    And makes as healthful music.
 It is not madness
    That I have utt'red. Bring me to the test,
    And I the matter will reword
; which madness
    Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
    Lay not that flattering unct
ion to your soul
    That not your trespass but my madness speaks.
    It will but skin and film t
he ulcerous place,
    Whiles rank corruption, mining all within,
    Infects unseen. Confess your
self to heaven;
    Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
    And do not spread the compost o
n the weeds
    To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;
    For in the fatness of these pu
rsy times
    Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg-
    Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him goo
d.
  Queen. O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
  Ham. O, throw away the worser part of i
t,
    And live the purer with the other half,
    Good night- but go not to my uncle's bed.
    
Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
    That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat
    Of habit
s evil, is angel yet in this,
    That to the use of actions fair and good
    He likewise gives a
 frock or livery,
    That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,
    And that shall lend a kind of ea
siness
    To the next abstinence; the next more easy;
    For use almost can change the stamp of 
nature,
    And either [master] the devil, or throw him out
    With wondrous potency. Once more, 
good night;
    And when you are desirous to be blest,
    I'll blessing beg of you.- For this sam
e lord,
    I do repent; but heaven hath pleas'd it so,
    To punish me with this, and this with 
me,
    That I must be their scourge and minister.
    I will bestow him, and will answer well
  
  The death I gave him. So again, good night.
    I must be cruel, only to be kind;
    Thus bad b
egins, and worse remains behind.
    One word more, good lady.
  Queen. What shall I do?
  Ham. N
ot this, by no means, that I bid you do:
    Let the bloat King tempt you again to bed;
    Pinch 
wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
    And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
    Or pad
dling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,
    Make you to ravel all this matter out,
    That I 
essentially am not in madness,
    But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;
    For who tha
t's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
    Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib
    Such dear conc
ernings hide? Who would do so?
    No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
    Unpeg the basket on th
e house's top,
    Let the birds fly, and like the famous ape,
    To try conclusions, in the bask
et creep
    And break your own neck down.
  Queen. Be thou assur'd, if words be made of breath,

    And breath of life, I have no life to breathe
    What thou hast said to me.
  Ham. I must to 
England; you know that?
  Queen. Alack,
    I had forgot! 'Tis so concluded on.
  Ham. There's le
tters seal'd; and my two schoolfellows,
    Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,
    They be
ar the mandate; they must sweep my way
    And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
    For 'tis th
e sport to have the enginer
    Hoist with his own petar; and 't shall go hard
    But I will delv
e one yard below their mines
    And blow them at the moon. O, 'tis most sweet
    When in one lin
e two crafts directly meet.
    This man shall set me packing.
    I'll lug the guts into the neig
hbour room.-
    Mother, good night.- Indeed, this counsellor
    Is now most still, most secret, 
and most grave,
    Who was in life a foolish peating knave.
    Come, sir, to draw toward an end 
with you.
    Good night, mother.
                  [Exit the Queen. Then] Exit Hamlet, tugging in

                                                       Polonius.

ACT IV. Scen
e I.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King and Queen, with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.


  King. There's matter in these sighs. These profound heaves
    You must translate; 'tis fit we u
nderstand them.
    Where is your son?
  Queen. Bestow this place on us a little while.
         
                 [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
    Ah, mine own lord, what have I seen to-
night!
  King. What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
  Queen. Mad as the sea and wind when both contend

    Which is the mightier. In his lawless fit
    Behind the arras hearing something stir,
    W
hips out his rapier, cries 'A rat, a rat!'
    And in this brainish apprehension kills
    The uns
een good old man.
  King. O heavy deed!
    It had been so with us, had we been there.
    His li
berty is full of threats to all-
    To you yourself, to us, to every one.
    Alas, how shall thi
s bloody deed be answer'd?
    It will be laid to us, whose providence
    Should have kept short,
 restrain'd, and out of haunt
    This mad young man. But so much was our love
    We would not un
derstand what was most fit,
    But, like the owner of a foul disease,
    To keep it from divulgi
ng, let it feed
    Even on the pith of life. Where is he gone?
  Queen. To draw apart the body he
 hath kill'd;
    O'er whom his very madness, like some ore
    Among a mineral of metals base,
 
   Shows itself pure. He weeps for what is done.
  King. O Gertrude, come away!
    The sun no soo
ner shall the mountains touch
    But we will ship him hence; and this vile deed
    We must with 
all our majesty and skill
    Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!

             Enter 
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

    Friends both, go join you with some further aid.
    Hamlet in
 madness hath Polonius slain,
    And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him.
    Go seek hi
m out; speak fair, and bring the body
    Into the chapel. I pray you haste in this.
             
             Exeunt [Rosencrantz and Guildenstern].
    Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest fr
iends
    And let them know both what we mean to do
    And what's untimely done. [So haply slande
r-]
    Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter,
    As level as the cannon to his blank,
    Tra
nsports his poisoned shot- may miss our name
    And hit the woundless air.- O, come away!
    My 
soul is full of discord and dismay.
                                                         Exeunt
.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A passage in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Safely stow'd.

  Gentlemen. (within) Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!
  Ham. But soft! What noise? Who calls on Hamlet? O, her
e they
come.

               Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Ros. What have you done, my
 lord, with the dead body?
  Ham. Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
  Ros. Tell us where 
'tis, that we may take it thence
    And bear it to the chapel.
  Ham. Do not believe it.
  Ros. 
Believe what?
  Ham. That I can keep your counsel, and not mine own. Besides,
to be
    demanded 
of a sponge, what replication should be made by the
son
    of a king?
  Ros. Take you me for a s
ponge, my lord?
  Ham. Ay, sir; that soaks up the King's countenance, his
rewards,
    his author
ities. But such officers do the King best service
in
    the end. He keeps them, like an ape, in t
he corner of his
jaw;
    first mouth'd, to be last swallowed. When he needs what you
have
    g
lean'd, it is but squeezing you and, sponge, you shall be
dry
    again.
  Ros. I understand you 
not, my lord.
  Ham. I am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.
  Ros. My lord, yo
u must tell us where the body is and go with us
to
    the King.
  Ham. The body is with the King
, but the King is not with the
body.
    The King is a thing-
  Guil. A thing, my lord?
  Ham. O
f nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.
                                              
           Exeunt.




Scene III.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King.

  King. I 
have sent to seek him and to find the body.
    How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
    
Yet must not we put the strong law on him.
    He's lov'd of the distracted multitude,
    Who lik
e not in their judgment, but their eyes;
    And where 'tis so, th' offender's scourge is weigh'd,

    But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,
    This sudden sending him away must seem

    Deliberate pause. Diseases desperate grown
    By desperate appliance are reliev'd,
    Or n
ot at all.

                    Enter Rosencrantz.

    How now O What hath befall'n?
  Ros. Wh
ere the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
    We cannot get from him.
  King. But where is he?
  Ro
s. Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
  King. Bring him before us.
  Ros. Ho, Guild
enstern! Bring in my lord.

        Enter Hamlet and Guildenstern [with Attendants].

  King. No
w, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
  Ham. At supper.
  King. At supper? Where?
  Ham. Not where he eats
, but where he is eaten. A certain
    convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your worm is

your
    only emperor for diet. We fat all creatures else to fat us,
and
    we fat ourselves for
 maggots. Your fat king and your lean
beggar
    is but variable service- two dishes, but to one t
able. That's
the
    end.
  King. Alas, alas!
  Ham. A man may fish with the worm that hath eat 
of a king, and
eat
    of the fish that hath fed of that worm.
  King. What dost thou mean by thi
s?
  Ham. Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress
through
    the guts of a beggar.

  King. Where is Polonius?
  Ham. In heaven. Send thither to see. If your messenger find him
not

    there, seek him i' th' other place yourself. But indeed, if
you
    find him not within this 
month, you shall nose him as you go
up
    the stair, into the lobby.
  King. Go seek him there. 
[To Attendants.]
  Ham. He will stay till you come.
                                            [E
xeunt Attendants.]
  King. Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,-
    Which we do tender a
s we dearly grieve
    For that which thou hast done,- must send thee hence
    With fiery quickne
ss. Therefore prepare thyself.
    The bark is ready and the wind at help,
    Th' associates tend
, and everything is bent
    For England.
  Ham. For England?
  King. Ay, Hamlet.
  Ham. Good.

  King. So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
  Ham. I see a cherub that sees them. But come, for
 England!
    Farewell, dear mother.
  King. Thy loving father, Hamlet.
  Ham. My mother! Father 
and mother is man and wife; man and wife
is
    one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England!

Exit.
  King. Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard.
    Delay it not; I'll have him hen
ce to-night.
    Away! for everything is seal'd and done
    That else leans on th' affair. Pray y
ou make haste.
                            Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]
    And, England, 
if my love thou hold'st at aught,-
    As my great power thereof may give thee sense,
    Since ye
t thy cicatrice looks raw and red
    After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
    Pays homage to 
us,- thou mayst not coldly set
    Our sovereign process, which imports at full,
    By letters co
ngruing to that effect,
    The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;
    For like the hectic i
n my blood he rages,
    And thou must cure me. Till I know 'tis done,
    Howe'er my haps, my joy
s were ne'er begun.             Exit.

Scene IV.
Near Elsinore.

Enter Fortin
bras with his Army over the stage.

  For. Go, Captain, from me greet the Danish king.
    Tell h
im that by his license Fortinbras
    Craves the conveyance of a promis'd march
    Over his kingd
om. You know the rendezvous.
    If that his Majesty would aught with us,
    We shall express our
 duty in his eye;
    And let him know so.
  Capt. I will do't, my lord.
  For. Go softly on.
  
                                 Exeunt [all but the Captain].

       Enter Hamlet, Rosencrantz, 
[Guildenstern,] and others.

  Ham. Good sir, whose powers are these?
  Capt. They are of Norway,
 sir.
  Ham. How purpos'd, sir, I pray you?
  Capt. Against some part of Poland.
  Ham. Who comma
nds them, sir?
  Capt. The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.
  Ham. Goes it against the main of Po
land, sir,
    Or for some frontier?
  Capt. Truly to speak, and with no addition,
    We go to g
ain a little patch of ground
    That hath in it no profit but the name.
    To pay five ducats, f
ive, I would not farm it;
    Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
    A ranker rate, should it
 be sold in fee.
  Ham. Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
  Capt. Yes, it is already garr
ison'd.
  Ham. Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
    Will not debate the question of t
his straw.
    This is th' imposthume of much wealth and peace,
    That inward breaks, and shows 
no cause without
    Why the man dies.- I humbly thank you, sir.
  Capt. God b' wi' you, sir.     
                        [Exit.]
  Ros. Will't please you go, my lord?
  Ham. I'll be with you stra
ight. Go a little before.
                                        [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]
    How
 all occasions do inform against me
    And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
    If his chief 
good and market of his time
    Be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.
    Sure he that made 
us with such large discourse,
    Looking before and after, gave us not
    That capability and go
dlike reason
    To fust in us unus'd. Now, whether it be
    Bestial oblivion, or some craven scr
uple
    Of thinking too precisely on th' event,-
    A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one par
t wisdom
    And ever three parts coward,- I do not know
    Why yet I live to say 'This thing's t
o do,'
    Sith I have cause, and will, and strength, and means
    To do't. Examples gross as ear
th exhort me.
    Witness this army of such mass and charge,
    Led by a delicate and tender prin
ce,
    Whose spirit, with divine ambition puff'd,
    Makes mouths at the invisible event,
    E
xposing what is mortal and unsure
    To all that fortune, death, and danger dare,
    Even for an
 eggshell. Rightly to be great
    Is not to stir without great argument,
    But greatly to find 
quarrel in a straw
    When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,
    That have a father kill'd
, a mother stain'd,
    Excitements of my reason and my blood,
    And let all sleep, while to my 
shame I see
    The imminent death of twenty thousand men
    That for a fantasy and trick of fame

    Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot
    Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,

    Which is not tomb enough and continent
    To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,
    My
 thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!            Exit.

Scene V.
Elsinore. 
A room in the Castle.

Enter Horatio, Queen, and a Gentleman.

  Queen. I will not speak with he
r.
  Gent. She is importunate, indeed distract.
    Her mood will needs be pitied.
  Queen. What 
would she have?
  Gent. She speaks much of her father; says she hears
    There's tricks i' th' wo
rld, and hems, and beats her heart;
    Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,
    Th
at carry but half sense. Her speech is nothing,
    Yet the unshaped use of it doth move
    The h
earers to collection; they aim at it,
    And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;
    Wh
ich, as her winks and nods and gestures yield them,
    Indeed would make one think there might be 
thought,
    Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
  Hor. 'Twere good she were spoken with; for
 she may strew
    Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.
  Queen. Let her come in.
       
                                        [Exit Gentleman.]
    [Aside] To my sick soul (as sin's tru
e nature is)
    Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
    So full of artless jealousy is g
uilt
    It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.

                 Enter Ophelia distracted.


  Oph. Where is the beauteous Majesty of Denmark?
  Queen. How now, Ophelia?
  Oph. (sings)
     
    How should I your true-love know
           From another one?
         By his cockle bat and' 
staff
           And his sandal shoon.

  Queen. Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
  Oph
. Say you? Nay, pray You mark.

    (Sings) He is dead and gone, lady,
              He is dead a
nd gone;
            At his head a grass-green turf,
              At his heels a stone.

    O,
 ho!
  Queen. Nay, but Ophelia-
  Oph. Pray you mark.

    (Sings) White his shroud as the mount
ain snow-

                    Enter King.

  Queen. Alas, look here, my lord!
  Oph. (Sings)

           Larded all with sweet flowers;
         Which bewept to the grave did not go
          
 With true-love showers.

  King. How do you, pretty lady?
  Oph. Well, God dild you! They say th
e owl was a baker's
daughter.
    Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be. God
be 
at
    your table!
  King. Conceit upon her father.
  Oph. Pray let's have no words of this; but 
when they ask, you
what
    it means, say you this:

    (Sings) To-morrow is Saint Valentine's 
day,
              All in the morning bedtime,
            And I a maid at your window,
         
     To be your Valentine.

            Then up he rose and donn'd his clo'es
              And d
upp'd the chamber door,
            Let in the maid, that out a maid
              Never departed 
more.

  King. Pretty Ophelia!
  Oph. Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't!

    
[Sings] By Gis and by Saint Charity,
              Alack, and fie for shame!
            Young men
 will do't if they come to't
              By Cock, they are to blame.

            Quoth she, 'B
efore you tumbled me,
              You promis'd me to wed.'

    He answers:

            'So 
would I 'a' done, by yonder sun,
              An thou hadst not come to my bed.'

  King. How lo
ng hath she been thus?
  Oph. I hope all will be well. We must be patient; but I cannot
    choose
 but weep to think they would lay him i' th' cold
ground.
    My brother shall know of it; and so 
I thank you for your good
    counsel. Come, my coach! Good night, ladies. Good night,
sweet
    
ladies. Good night, good night.                         Exit
  King. Follow her close; give her goo
d watch, I pray you.
                                                 [Exit Horatio.]

    O, thi
s is the poison of deep grief; it springs
    All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
 
   When sorrows come, they come not single spies.
    But in battalions! First, her father slain;

    Next, your son gone, and he most violent author
    Of his own just remove; the people muddied,

    Thick and and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers
    For good Polonius' death, and we
 have done but greenly
    In hugger-mugger to inter him; poor Ophelia
    Divided from herself an
d her fair judgment,
    Without the which we are pictures or mere beasts;
    Last, and as much c
ontaining as all these,
    Her brother is in secret come from France;
    And wants not buzzers t
o infect his ear
    Feeds on his wonder, keep, himself in clouds,
    With pestilent speeches of 
his father's death,
    Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
    Will nothing stick our person t
o arraign
    In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
    Like to a murd'ring piece, in many pla
ces
    Give me superfluous death.                  A noise within.
  Queen. Alack, what noise is 
this?
  King. Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.

                     Enter a Messe
nger.

    What is the matter?
  Mess. Save Yourself, my lord:
    The ocean, overpeering of his
 list,
    Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
    Than Young Laertes, in a riotous head,

    O'erbears Your offices. The rabble call him lord;
    And, as the world were now but to begin
,
    Antiquity forgot, custom not known,
    The ratifiers and props of every word,
    They cry
 'Choose we! Laertes shall be king!'
    Caps, hands, and tongues applaud it to the clouds,
    'L
aertes shall be king! Laertes king!'
                                                 A noise withi
n.
  Queen. How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!
    O, this is counter, you false Danish d
ogs!
  King. The doors are broke.

                    Enter Laertes with others.

  Laer. Wher
e is this king?- Sirs, staid you all without.
  All. No, let's come in!
  Laer. I pray you give me
 leave.
  All. We will, we will!
  Laer. I thank you. Keep the door.      [Exeunt his Followers.]

    O thou vile king,
    Give me my father!
  Queen. Calmly, good Laertes.
  Laer. That drop of
 blood that's calm proclaims me bastard;
    Cries cuckold to my father; brands the harlot
    Eve
n here between the chaste unsmirched brows
    Of my true mother.
  King. What is the cause, Laert
es,
    That thy rebellion looks so giantlike?
    Let him go, Gertrude. Do not fear our person.

    There's such divinity doth hedge a king
    That treason can but peep to what it would,
    Ac
ts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,
    Why thou art thus incens'd. Let him go, Gertrude.
   
 Speak, man.
  Laer. Where is my father?
  King. Dead.
  Queen. But not by him!
  King. Let him 
demand his fill.
  Laer. How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
    To hell, allegiance! vows
, to the blackest devil
    Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
    I dare damnation. To
 this point I stand,
    That both the world, I give to negligence,
    Let come what comes; only 
I'll be reveng'd
    Most throughly for my father.
  King. Who shall stay you?
  Laer. My will, n
ot all the world!
    And for my means, I'll husband them so well
    They shall go far with littl
e.
  King. Good Laertes,
    If you desire to know the certainty
    Of your dear father's death,
 is't writ in your revenge
    That sweepstake you will draw both friend and foe,
    Winner and l
oser?
  Laer. None but his enemies.
  King. Will you know them then?
  Laer. To his good friends 
thus wide I'll ope my arms
    And, like the kind life-rend'ring pelican,
    Repast them with my 
blood.
  King. Why, now You speak
    Like a good child and a true gentleman.
    That I am guilt
less of your father's death,
    And am most sensibly in grief for it,
    It shall as level to yo
ur judgment pierce
    As day does to your eye.
                              A noise within: 'Let
 her come in.'
  Laer. How now? What noise is that?

                      Enter Ophelia.

    
O heat, dry up my brains! Tears seven times salt
    Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!
  
  By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight
    Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!

    Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
    O heavens! is't possible a young maid's wits
    Sh
ould be as mortal as an old man's life?
    Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,
    It se
nds some precious instance of itself
    After the thing it loves.

  Oph. (sings)
         They
 bore him barefac'd on the bier
           (Hey non nony, nony, hey nony)
         And in his grav
e rain'd many a tear.

    Fare you well, my dove!
  Laer. Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuad
e revenge,
    It could not move thus.
  Oph. You must sing 'A-down a-down, and you call him a-dow
n-a.'
O,
    how the wheel becomes it! It is the false steward, that stole
his
    master's daug
hter.
  Laer. This nothing's more than matter.
  Oph. There's rosemary, that's for remembrance. Pr
ay you, love,
    remember. And there is pansies, that's for thoughts.
  Laer. A document in madne
ss! Thoughts and remembrance fitted.
  Oph. There's fennel for you, and columbines. There's rue for

you,
    and here's some for me. We may call it herb of grace o'
Sundays.
    O, you must wear 
your rue with a difference! There's a daisy.
I
    would give you some violets, but they wither'd 
all when my
father
    died. They say he made a good end.

    [Sings] For bonny sweet Robin is 
all my joy.

  Laer. Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,
    She turns to favour and to
 prettiness.
  Oph. (sings)
         And will he not come again?
         And will he not come ag
ain?
           No, no, he is dead;
           Go to thy deathbed;
         He never will come ag
ain.

         His beard was as white as snow,
         All flaxen was his poll.
           He i
s gone, he is gone,
           And we cast away moan.
         God 'a'mercy on his soul!

    An
d of all Christian souls, I pray God. God b' wi' you.
Exit.
  Laer. Do you see this, O God?
  Kin
g. Laertes, I must commune with your grief,
    Or you deny me right. Go but apart,
    Make choic
e of whom your wisest friends you will,
    And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me.
    I
f by direct or by collateral hand
    They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,
    Our crow
n, our life, and all that we call ours,
    To you in satisfaction; but if not,
    Be you content
 to lend your patience to us,
    And we shall jointly labour with your soul
    To give it due co
ntent.
  Laer. Let this be so.
    His means of death, his obscure funeral-
    No trophy, sword,
 nor hatchment o'er his bones,
    No noble rite nor formal ostentation,-
    Cry to be heard, as 
'twere from heaven to earth,
    That I must call't in question.
  King. So you shall;
    And wh
ere th' offence is let the great axe fall.
    I pray you go with me.
                            
                              Exeunt

 Sailor. God bless you, sir.

England- 
if
    your name be Horatio, as I am let to know it is.
  Hor. (reads the letter) 'Horatio, when t

    lett
ers for him. Ere we were two days old at sea, a pirate of

ase. Finding ourselves too
    slow of sail, we put on a compelled valour, and in the
grapple I
 
   boarded them. On the instant they got clear of our ship; so I
    alone became their prisoner. T
hey have dealt with me like
thieves
    of mercy; but they knew what they did: I am to do a good t
urn
for
    them. Let the King have the letters I have sent, and repair
thou
    to me with as m
uch speed as thou wouldst fly death. I have
words
    to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb; y

to tell thee. Farewell.

Scene VII.
Els
inore. Another room in the Castle.

Enter King and Laertes.

  King. Now must your conscience my
 acquittance seal,
    And You must put me in your heart for friend,
    Sith you have heard, and 
with a knowing ear,
    That he which hath your noble father slain
    Pursued my life.
  Laer. I
t well appears. But tell me
    Why you proceeded not against these feats
    So crimeful and so c
apital in nature,
    As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
    You mainly were stirr'd up.

  King. O, for two special reasons,
    Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,
    But y
et to me they are strong. The Queen his mother
    Lives almost by his looks; and for myself,-
   
 My virtue or my plague, be it either which,-
    She's so conjunctive to my life and soul
    Tha
t, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
    I could not but by her. The other motive
    Why t
o a public count I might not go
    Is the great love the general gender bear him,
    Who, dippin
g all his faults in their affection,
    Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
    Co
nvert his gives to graces; so that my arrows,
    Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,
    Wo
uld have reverted to my bow again,
    And not where I had aim'd them.
  Laer. And so have I a nob
le father lost;
    A sister driven into desp'rate terms,
    Whose worth, if praises may go back 
again,
    Stood challenger on mount of all the age
    For her perfections. But my revenge will c
ome.
  King. Break not your sleeps for that. You must not think
    That we are made of stuff so f
lat and dull
    That we can let our beard be shook with danger,
    And think it pastime. You sho
rtly shall hear more.
    I lov'd your father, and we love ourself,
    And that, I hope, will tea
ch you to imagine-

                 Enter a Messenger with letters.

    How now? What news?
 
 Mess. Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:
    This to your Majesty; this to the Queen.
  King. From Ha
mlet? Who brought them?
  Mess. Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not.
    They were given me
 by Claudio; he receiv'd them
    Of him that brought them.
  King. Laertes, you shall hear them.

    Leave us.
                                                 Exit Messenger.
    [Reads]'High a
nd Mighty,-You shall know I am set naked on
your
    kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see y
our kingly eyes;
    when I shall (first asking your pardon thereunto) recount the
    occasion of
 my sudden and more strange return.
                                                     'HAMLET.'

    What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?
    Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?

  Laer. Know you the hand?
  King. 'Tis Hamlet's character. 'Naked!'
    And in a postscript her
e, he says 'alone.'
    Can you advise me?
  Laer. I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come!
  
  It warms the very sickness in my heart
    That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,
    'Thu
s didest thou.'
  King. If it be so, Laertes
    (As how should it be so? how otherwise?),
    Wi
ll you be rul'd by me?
  Laer. Ay my lord,
    So you will not o'errule me to a peace.
  King. To
 thine own peace. If he be now return'd
    As checking at his voyage, and that he means
    No mo
re to undertake it, I will work him
    To exploit now ripe in my device,
    Under the which he s
hall not choose but fall;
    And for his death no wind shall breathe
    But even his mother shal
l uncharge the practice
    And call it accident.
  Laer. My lord, I will be rul'd;
    The rathe
r, if you could devise it so
    That I might be the organ.
  King. It falls right.
    You have 
been talk'd of since your travel much,
    And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality
    Wherein
 they say you shine, Your sum of parts
    Did not together pluck such envy from him
    As did th
at one; and that, in my regard,
    Of the unworthiest siege.
  Laer. What part is that, my lord?

  King. A very riband in the cap of youth-
    Yet needfull too; for youth no less becomes
    Th
e light and careless livery that it wears
    Than settled age his sables and his weeds,
    Impor
ting health and graveness. Two months since
    Here was a gentleman of Normandy.
    I have seen 
myself, and serv'd against, the French,
    And they can well on horseback; but this gallant
    H
ad witchcraft in't. He grew unto his seat,
    And to such wondrous doing brought his horse
    As
 had he been incorps'd and demi-natur'd
    With the brave beast. So far he topp'd my thought
    
That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
    Come short of what he did.
  Laer. A Norman was't?
 
 King. A Norman.
  Laer. Upon my life, Lamound.
  King. The very same.
  Laer. I know him well. H
e is the broach indeed
    And gem of all the nation.
  King. He made confession of you;
    And 
gave you such a masterly report
    For art and exercise in your defence,
    And for your rapier 
most especially,
    That he cried out 'twould be a sight indeed
    If one could match you. The s
crimers of their nation
    He swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
    If you oppos'd them. 
Sir, this report of his
    Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
    That he could nothing do but w
ish and beg
    Your sudden coming o'er to play with you.
    Now, out of this-
  Laer. What out 
of this, my lord?
  King. Laertes, was your father dear to you?
    Or are you like the painting o
f a sorrow,
    A face without a heart,'
  Laer. Why ask you this?
  King. Not that I think you d
id not love your father;
    But that I know love is begun by time,
    And that I see, in passage
s of proof,
    Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
    There lives within the very flame of 
love
    A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
    And nothing is at a like goodness still;

    For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
    Dies in his own too-much. That we would do,
    We sh
ould do when we would; for this 'would' changes,
    And hath abatements and delays as many
    As
 there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
    And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh
,
    That hurts by easing. But to the quick o' th' ulcer!
    Hamlet comes back. What would you u
ndertake
    To show yourself your father's son in deed
    More than in words?
  Laer. To cut hi
s throat i' th' church!
  King. No place indeed should murther sanctuarize;
    Revenge should hav
e no bounds. But, good Laertes,
    Will you do this? Keep close within your chamber.
    Hamlet r
eturn'd shall know you are come home.
    We'll put on those shall praise your excellence
    And 
set a double varnish on the fame
    The Frenchman gave you; bring you in fine together
    And wa
ger on your heads. He, being remiss,
    Most generous, and free from all contriving,
    Will not
 peruse the foils; so that with ease,
    Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
    A sword u
nbated, and, in a pass of practice,
    Requite him for your father.
  Laer. I will do't!
    And
 for that purpose I'll anoint my sword.
    I bought an unction of a mountebank,
    So mortal tha
t, but dip a knife in it,
    Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
    Collected from all si
mples that have virtue
    Under the moon, can save the thing from death
    This is but scratch'd
 withal. I'll touch my point
    With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
    It may be 
death.
  King. Let's further think of this,
    Weigh what convenience both of time and means
   
 May fit us to our shape. If this should fall,
    And that our drift look through our bad performa
nce.
    'Twere better not assay'd. Therefore this project
    Should have a back or second, that 
might hold
    If this did blast in proof. Soft! let me see.
    We'll make a solemn wager on your
 cunnings-
    I ha't!
    When in your motion you are hot and dry-
    As make your bouts more v
iolent to that end-
    And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepar'd him
    A chalice for the 
nonce; whereon but sipping,
    If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
    Our purpose may hol
d there.- But stay, what noise,

                           Enter Queen.

    How now, sweet que
en?
  Queen. One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
    So fast they follow. Your sister's drown'
d, Laertes.
  Laer. Drown'd! O, where?
  Queen. There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
    That 
shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream.
    There with fantastic garlands did she come
    Of 
crowflowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,
    That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
 
   But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them.
    There on the pendant boughs her coronet 
weeds
    Clamb'ring to hang, an envious sliver broke,
    When down her weedy trophies and hersel
f
    Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide
    And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore h
er up;
    Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes,
    As one incapable of her own distress
,
    Or like a creature native and indued
    Unto that element; but long it could not be
    Ti
ll that her garments, heavy with their drink,
    Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay
  
  To muddy death.
  Laer. Alas, then she is drown'd?
  Queen. Drown'd, drown'd.
  Laer. Too much 
of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
    And therefore I forbid my tears; but yet
    It is our trick
; nature her custom holds,
    Let shame say what it will. When these are gone,
    The woman will
 be out. Adieu, my lord.
    I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze
    But that this foll
y douts it.                          Exit.
  King. Let's follow, Gertrude.
    How much I had to d
o to calm his rage I
    Now fear I this will give it start again;
    Therefore let's follow.
  
                                                       Exeunt.

ACT V. Scene I.

Elsinore. A churchyard.

Enter two Clowns, [with spades and pickaxes].

  Clown. Is she to be b
uried in Christian burial when she
wilfully
    seeks her own salvation?
  Other. I tell thee she
 is; therefore make her grave straight.
    The crowner hath sate on her, and finds it Christian bu
rial.
  Clown. How can that be, unless she drown'd herself in her own
    defence?
  Other. Why, 
'tis found so.
  Clown. It must be se offendendo; it cannot be else. For here
lies
    the point:
 if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act; and
an
    act hath three branches-it is to act, t
o do, and to perform;
    argal, she drown'd herself wittingly.
  Other. Nay, but hear you, Goodma
n Delver!
  Clown. Give me leave. Here lies the water; good. Here stands
the
    man; good. If th
e man go to this water and drown himself, it
is,
    will he nill he, he goes- mark you that. But 
if the water
come to
    him and drown him, he drowns not himself. Argal, he that is
not
    gui
lty of his own death shortens not his own life.
  Other. But is this law?
  Clown. Ay, marry, is't
- crowner's quest law.
  Other. Will you ha' the truth an't? If this had not been a
    gentlewoma
n, she should have been buried out o' Christian
burial.
  Clown. Why, there thou say'st! And the m
ore pity that great
folk
    should have count'nance in this world to drown or hang
themselves
 
   more than their even-Christian. Come, my spade! There is no
    ancient gentlemen but gard'ners,
 ditchers, and grave-makers.
They
    hold up Adam's profession.
  Other. Was he a gentleman?
  
Clown. 'A was the first that ever bore arms.
  Other. Why, he had none.
  Clown. What, art a heath
en? How dost thou understand the
Scripture?
    The Scripture says Adam digg'd. Could he dig witho
ut arms?
I'll
    put another question to thee. If thou answerest me not to the
    purpose, conf
ess thyself-
  Other. Go to!
  Clown. What is he that builds stronger than either the mason,
the

    shipwright, or the carpenter?
  Other. The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand

    tenants.
  Clown. I like thy wit well, in good faith. The gallows does
well.
    But how does
 it well? It does well to those that do ill. Now,
    thou dost ill to say the gallows is built str
onger than the
    church. Argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To't again,
come!
  Other. Who
 builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a
    carpenter?
  Clown. Ay, tell me that, and un
yoke.
  Other. Marry, now I can tell!
  Clown. To't.
  Other. Mass, I cannot tell.

           
      Enter Hamlet and Horatio afar off.

  Clown. Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your du
ll ass
will
    not mend his pace with beating; and when you are ask'd this
    question next, sa
y 'a grave-maker.' The houses he makes lasts
    till doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan; fetch me a
 stoup of
    liquor.

                 [Clown digs and] sings.

       In youth when I did love, did love,
         Met
hought it was very sweet;
       To contract- O- the time for- a- my behove,
         O, methought
 there- a- was nothing- a- meet.

  Ham. Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings

at
    grave-making?
  Hor. Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.
  Ham. 'Tis e'en
 so. The hand of little employment hath the
daintier
    sense.
  Clown. (sings)
         But ag
e with his stealing steps
           Hath clawed me in his clutch,
         And hath shipped me in
til the land,
           As if I had never been such.
                                            
[Throws up a skull.]

  Ham. That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once. How
the
    kna
ve jowls it to the ground,as if 'twere Cain's jawbone,
that
    did the first murther! This might 
be the pate of a
Politician,
    which this ass now o'erreaches; one that would circumvent
God,

    might it not?
  Hor. It might, my lord.
  Ham. Or of a courtier, which could say 'Good morrow,
 sweet
lord!
    How dost thou, good lord?' This might be my Lord Such-a-one,
that
    prais'd m
y Lord Such-a-one's horse when he meant to beg it-
might
    it not?
  Hor. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. 
Why, e'en so! and now my Lady Worm's, chapless, and
knock'd
    about the mazzard with a sexton's 
spade. Here's fine
revolution,
    and we had the trick to see't. Did these bones cost no more
th
e
    breeding but to play at loggets with 'em? Mine ache to think
    on't.
  Clown. (Sings)
  
       A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,
           For and a shrouding sheet;
         O, a Pit of 
clay for to be made
           For such a guest is meet.
                                      Thr
ows up [another skull].

  Ham. There's another. Why may not that be the skull of a
lawyer?
    
Where be his quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, his
tenures,
    and his tricks? Why does he s
uffer this rude knave now to
knock
    him about the sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell

him
    of his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be in's time
a
    great buyer of land
, with his statutes, his recognizances,
his
    fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries. Is thi
s the fine
of
    his fines, and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his
fine
    pate full 
of fine dirt? Will his vouchers vouch him no more
of
    his purchases, and double ones too, than 
the length and
breadth
    of a pair of indentures? The very conveyances of his lands
will
    s
carcely lie in this box; and must th' inheritor himself have
no
    more, ha?
  Hor. Not a jot mo
re, my lord.
  Ham. Is not parchment made of sheepskins?
  Hor. Ay, my lord, And of calveskins too
.
  Ham. They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in
that. I
    will speak to this fel
low. Whose grave's this, sirrah?
  Clown. Mine, sir.

    [Sings] O, a pit of clay for to be made

              For such a guest is meet.

  Ham. I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in't.

  Clown. You lie out on't, sir, and therefore 'tis not yours.
    For my part, I do not lie in't,
 yet it is mine.
  Ham. Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine. 'Tis
for
    the dead
, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.
  Clown. 'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away again from m
e to you.
  Ham. What man dost thou dig it for?
  Clown. For no man, sir.
  Ham. What woman then?

  Clown. For none neither.
  Ham. Who is to be buried in't?
  Clown. One that was a woman, sir; 
but, rest her soul, she's
dead.
  Ham. How absolute the knave is! We must speak by the card, or
 
   equivocation will undo us. By the Lord, Horatio, this three
years
    I have taken note of it, 
the age is grown so picked that the
toe
    of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier 
he
galls
    his kibe.- How long hast thou been a grave-maker?
  Clown. Of all the days i' th' ye
ar, I came to't that day that
our
    last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.
  Ham. How long is th
at since?
  Clown. Cannot you tell that? Every fool can tell that. It was
the
    very day that y
oung Hamlet was born- he that is mad, and sent
    into England.
  Ham. Ay, marry, why was be sent
 into England?
  Clown. Why, because 'a was mad. 'A shall recover his wits
there;
    or, if 'a d
o not, 'tis no great matter there.
  Ham. Why?
  Clown. 'Twill not he seen in him there. There the
 men are as
mad as
    he.
  Ham. How came he mad?
  Clown. Very strangely, they say.
  Ham. Ho
w strangely?
  Clown. Faith, e'en with losing his wits.
  Ham. Upon what ground?
  Clown. Why, he
re in Denmark. I have been sexton here, man and
boy
    thirty years.
  Ham. How long will a man 
lie i' th' earth ere he rot?
  Clown. Faith, if 'a be not rotten before 'a die (as we have
many
 
   pocky corses now-a-days that will scarce hold the laying in,
I
    will last you some eight yea
r or nine year. A tanner will
last
    you nine year.
  Ham. Why he more than another?
  Clown. 
Why, sir, his hide is so tann'd with his trade that 'a
will
    keep out water a great while; and 
your water is a sore
decayer of
    your whoreson dead body. Here's a skull now. This skull hath

lien
    you i' th' earth three-and-twenty years.
  Ham. Whose was it?
  Clown. A whoreson, mad f
ellow's it was. Whose do you think it
was?
  Ham. Nay, I know not.
  Clown. A pestilence on him f
or a mad rogue! 'A pour'd a flagon
of
    Rhenish on my head once. This same skull, sir, was Yoric
k's
    skull, the King's jester.
  Ham. This?
  Clown. E'en that.
  Ham. Let me see. [Takes the
 skull.] Alas, poor Yorick! I knew
him,
    Horatio. A fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent 
fancy.
He
    hath borne me on his back a thousand times. And now how
abhorred
    in my imagina
tion it is! My gorge rises at it. Here hung
those
    lips that I have kiss'd I know not how oft. 
Where be your
gibes
    now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment that
    were wo
nt to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock
your
    own grinning? Quite chap- fall'n? Now
 get you to my lady's
    chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this
    favour s
he must come. Make her laugh at that. Prithee,
Horatio,
    tell me one thing.
  Hor. What's that
, my lord?
  Ham. Dost thou think Alexander look'd o' this fashion i' th'
earth?
  Hor. E'en so.

  Ham. And smelt so? Pah!
                                          [Puts down the skull.]
  Hor.
 E'en so, my lord.
  Ham. To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not
    imagination tr
ace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it
    stopping a bunghole?
  Hor. 'Twere to consider
 too curiously, to consider so.
  Ham. No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with
modest
y
    enough, and likelihood to lead it; as thus: Alexander died,
    Alexander was buried, Alexan
der returneth into dust; the dust
is
    earth; of earth we make loam; and why of that loam (where
to
he
    was converted) might they not stop a beer barrel?
    Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd
 to clay,
    Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.
    O, that that earth which kept the world
 in awe
    Should patch a wall t' expel the winter's flaw!
    But soft! but soft! aside! Here co
mes the King-

    Enter [priests with] a coffin [in funeral procession], King,
             Quee
n, Laertes, with Lords attendant.]

    The Queen, the courtiers. Who is this they follow?
    An
d with such maimed rites? This doth betoken
    The corse they follow did with desp'rate hand
    
Fordo it own life. 'Twas of some estate.
    Couch we awhile, and mark.
                          
               [Retires with Horatio.]

  Laer. What ceremony else?
  Ham. That is Laertes,
    
A very noble youth. Mark.
  Laer. What ceremony else?
  Priest. Her obsequies have been as far enl
arg'd
    As we have warranty. Her death was doubtful;
    And, but that great command o'ersways t
he order,
    She should in ground unsanctified have lodg'd
    Till the last trumpet. For charita
ble prayers,
    Shards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on her.
    Yet here she is allow'd 
her virgin rites,
    Her maiden strewments, and the bringing home
    Of bell and burial.
  Laer
. Must there no more be done?
  Priest. No more be done.
    We should profane the service of the 
dead
    To sing a requiem and such rest to her
    As to peace-parted souls.
  Laer. Lay her i' 
th' earth;
    And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
    May violets spring! I tell thee, churlis
h priest,
    A minist'ring angel shall my sister be
    When thou liest howling.
  Ham. What, th
e fair Ophelia?
  Queen. Sweets to the sweet! Farewell.
                                          
   [Scatters flowers.]
    I hop'd thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
    I thought thy bri
de-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
    And not have strew'd thy grave.
  Laer. O, treble woe
    
Fall ten times treble on that cursed head
    Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
    Depri
v'd thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,
    Till I have caught her once more in mine arms.
       
                                      Leaps in the grave.
    Now pile your dust upon the quick and
 dead
    Till of this flat a mountain you have made
    T' o'ertop old Pelion or the skyish head

    Of blue Olympus.
  Ham. [comes forward] What is he whose grief
    Bears such an emphasis? wh
ose phrase of sorrow
    Conjures the wand'ring stars, and makes them stand
    Like wonder-wounde
d hearers? This is I,

 devil take thy soul!

  Ham. Thou
 pray'st not well.

    For, though I am not splenit
ive and rash,
    Yet have I in me something dangerous,
    Which let thy wisdom fear. Hold off th

rd, be quiet.

  Ham. Why, I will fight with him upon this theme
  
  Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
  Queen. O my son, what theme?
  Ham. I lov'd Ophelia. Fort
y thousand brothers
    Could not (with all their quantity of love)
    Make up my sum. What wilt 
thou do for her?
  King. O, he is mad, Laertes.
  Queen. For love of God, forbear him!
  Ham. 'Sw
ounds, show me what thou't do.
    Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?
    Wo
o't drink up esill? eat a crocodile?
    I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?
    To outface m
e with leaping in her grave?
    Be buried quick with her, and so will I.
    And if thou prate of
 mountains, let them throw
    Millions of acres on us, till our ground,
    Singeing his pate aga
inst the burning zone,
    Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
    I'll rant as well as 
thou.
  Queen. This is mere madness;
    And thus a while the fit will work on him.
    Anon, as 
patient as the female dove
    When that her golden couplets are disclos'd,
    His silence will s
it drooping.
  Ham. Hear you, sir!
    What is the reason that you use me thus?
    I lov'd you e
ver. But it is no matter.
    Let Hercules himself do what he may,
    The cat will mew, and dog w
ill have his day.
Exit.
  King. I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.

speech.

Scene II.
Elsinore. A hall in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet and Horatio.

 
 Ham. So much for this, sir; now shall you see the other.
    You do remember all the circumstance?

  Hor. Remember it, my lord!
  Ham. Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting
    That would
 not let me sleep. Methought I lay
    Worse than the mutinies in the bilboes. Rashly-
    And pra
is'd be rashness for it; let us know,
    Our indiscretion sometime serves us well
    When our de
ep plots do pall; and that should learn us
    There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
    Rough-
hew them how we will-
  Hor. That is most certain.
  Ham. Up from my cabin,
    My sea-gown scarf
'd about me, in the dark
    Grop'd I to find out them; had my desire,
    Finger'd their packet, 
and in fine withdrew
    To mine own room again; making so bold
    (My fears forgetting manners) 
to unseal
    Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio
    (O royal knavery!), an exact comm
and,
    Larded with many several sorts of reasons,
    Importing Denmark's health, and England's 
too,
    With, hoo! such bugs and goblins in my life-
    That, on the supervise, no leisure bated
,
    No, not to stay the finding of the axe,
    My head should be struck off.
  Hor. Is't possi
ble?
  Ham. Here's the commission; read it at more leisure.
    But wilt thou bear me how I did pr
oceed?
  Hor. I beseech you.
  Ham. Being thus benetted round with villanies,
    Or I could make
 a prologue to my brains,
    They had begun the play. I sat me down;
    Devis'd a new commission
; wrote it fair.
    I once did hold it, as our statists do,
    A baseness to write fair, and lab
our'd much
    How to forget that learning; but, sir, now
    It did me yeoman's service. Wilt tho
u know
    Th' effect of what I wrote?
  Hor. Ay, good my lord.
  Ham. An earnest conjuration fro
m the King,
    As England was his faithful tributary,
    As love between them like the palm migh
t flourish,
    As peace should still her wheaten garland wear
    And stand a comma 'tween their 
amities,
    And many such-like as's of great charge,
    That, on the view and knowing of these c
ontents,
    Without debatement further, more or less,
    He should the bearers put to sudden dea
th,
    Not shriving time allow'd.
  Hor. How was this seal'd?
  Ham. Why, even in that was heave
n ordinant.
    I had my father's signet in my purse,
    Which was the model of that Danish seal;

    Folded the writ up in the form of th' other,
    Subscrib'd it, gave't th' impression, plac'd
 it safely,
    The changeling never known. Now, the next day
    Was our sea-fight; and what to t
his was sequent
    Thou know'st already.
  Hor. So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.
  Ham. 
Why, man, they did make love to this employment!
    They are not near my conscience; their defeat

    Does by their own insinuation grow.
    'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
    Betwee
n the pass and fell incensed points
    Of mighty opposites.
  Hor. Why, what a king is this!
  H
am. Does it not, thinks't thee, stand me now upon-
    He that hath kill'd my king, and whor'd my m
other;
    Popp'd in between th' election and my hopes;
    Thrown out his angle for my proper lif
e,
    And with such coz'nage- is't not perfect conscience
    To quit him with this arm? And is't
 not to be damn'd
    To let this canker of our nature come
    In further evil?
  Hor. It must b
e shortly known to him from England
    What is the issue of the business there.
  Ham. It will be
 short; the interim is mine,
    And a man's life is no more than to say 'one.'
    But I am very 
sorry, good Horatio,
    That to Laertes I forgot myself,
    For by the image of my cause I see

    The portraiture of his. I'll court his favours.
    But sure the bravery of his grief did put m
e
    Into a tow'ring passion.
  Hor. Peace! Who comes here?

                 Enter young Osric
, a courtier.

  Osr. Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
  Ham. I humbly thank you, 
sir. [Aside to Horatio] Dost know this
    waterfly?
  Hor. [aside to Hamlet] No, my good lord.
 
 Ham. [aside to Horatio] Thy state is the more gracious; for
'tis a
    vice to know him. He hath 
much land, and fertile. Let a beast
be
    lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at the king's 
mess.
'Tis
    a chough; but, as I say, spacious in the possession of dirt.

  Osr. Sweet lord, 
if your lordship were at leisure, I should
impart
    a thing to you from his Majesty.
  Ham. I w
ill receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit. Put
your
    bonnet to his right use. 'Tis for 
the head.
  Osr. I thank your lordship, it is very hot.
  Ham. No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the
 wind is northerly.
  Osr. It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
  Ham. But yet methinks it is 
very sultry and hot for my
complexion.
  Osr. Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry, as 'twere- 
I
cannot
    tell how. But, my lord, his Majesty bade me signify to you
that
    he has laid a g
reat wager on your head. Sir, this is the
matter-
  Ham. I beseech you remember.
                
           [Hamlet moves him to put on his hat.]
  Osr. Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good f
aith. Sir, here
is
    newly come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute
gentleman,
    full 
of most excellent differences, of very soft society and
    great showing. Indeed, to speak feeling
ly of him, he is the
card
    or calendar of gentry; for you shall find in him the
continent of

    what part a gentleman would see.
  Ham. Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you; though
, I

    know, to divide him inventorially would dozy th' arithmetic
of
    memory, and yet but 
yaw neither in respect of his quick sail.
    But, in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a s
oul of
great
    article, and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as, to
make
    true dict
ion of him, his semblable is his mirror, and who
else
    would trace him, his umbrage, nothing mo
re.
  Osr. Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
  Ham. The concernancy, sir? Why do we wra
p the gentleman in our
more
    rawer breath?
  Osr. Sir?
  Hor [aside to Hamlet] Is't not possi
ble to understand in
another
    tongue? You will do't, sir, really.
  Ham. What imports the nomi
nation of this gentleman?
  Osr. Of Laertes?
  Hor. [aside] His purse is empty already. All's gold
en words are
    spent.
  Ham. Of him, sir.
  Osr. I know you are not ignorant-
  Ham. I would y
ou did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would
not
    much approve me. Well, sir?
  Osr. You a
re not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is-
  Ham. I dare not confess that, lest I should compar
e with him in
    excellence; but to know a man well were to know himself.
  Osr. I mean, sir, for
 his weapon; but in the imputation laid on
him
    by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.
  Ham. W
hat's his weapon?
  Osr. Rapier and dagger.
  Ham. That's two of his weapons- but well.
  Osr. Th
e King, sir, hath wager'd with him six Barbary horses;
    against the which he has impon'd, as I t
ake it, six French
    rapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers,
and
    so. 
Three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy,
    very responsive to the hilts, most de
licate carriages, and of
    very liberal conceit.
  Ham. What call you the carriages?
  Hor. [as
ide to Hamlet] I knew you must be edified by the
margent
    ere you had done.
  Osr. The carriag
es, sir, are the hangers.
  Ham. The phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could
    ca
rry cannon by our sides. I would it might be hangers till
then.
    But on! Six Barbary horses aga
inst six French swords, their
    assigns, and three liberal-conceited carriages: that's the
Frenc
h
    bet against the Danish. Why is this all impon'd, as you call
it?
  Osr. The King, sir, hath
 laid that, in a dozen passes between
    yourself and him, he shall not exceed you three hits; he 
hath
    laid on twelve for nine, and it would come to immediate trial
    if your lordship would 
vouchsafe the answer.
  Ham. How if I answer no?
  Osr. I mean, my lord, the opposition of your pe
rson in trial.
  Ham. Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please his
Majesty,
    it is the 
breathing time of day with me. Let the foils be
    brought, the gentleman willing, and the King ho
ld his
purpose,
    I will win for him if I can; if not, I will gain nothing but
my
    shame an
d the odd hits.
  Osr. Shall I redeliver you e'en so?
  Ham. To this effect, sir, after what flour
ish your nature will.
  Osr. I commend my duty to your lordship.
  Ham. Yours, yours. [Exit Osric.
] He does well to commend it
    himself; there are no tongues else for's turn.
  Hor. This lapwin
g runs away with the shell on his head.
  Ham. He did comply with his dug before he suck'd it. Thus
 has
he,
    and many more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age
dotes
    on, only got th
e tune of the time and outward habit of
encounter-
    a kind of yesty collection, which carries t
hem through and
    through the most fann'd and winnowed opinions; and do but
blow
    them to th
eir trial-the bubbles are out,

                            Enter a Lord.

  Lord. My lord, his 
Majesty commended him to you by young Osric,
who
    brings back to him, that you attend him in th
e hall. He sends
to
    know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you
will
    ta
ke longer time.
  Ham. I am constant to my purposes; they follow the King's
pleasure.
    If his 
fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or whensoever,
provided
    I be so able as now.
  Lord. The K
ing and Queen and all are coming down.
  Ham. In happy time.
  Lord. The Queen desires you to use 
some gentle entertainment to
    Laertes before you fall to play.
  Ham. She well instructs me.
 
                                                   [Exit Lord.]
  Hor. You will lose this wager, my
 lord.
  Ham. I do not think so. Since he went into France I have been
in
    continual practice.
 I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst
not
    think how ill all's here about my heart. But it
 is no matter.
  Hor. Nay, good my lord -
  Ham. It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gaing
iving as
    would perhaps trouble a woman.
  Hor. If your mind dislike anything, obey it. I will 
forestall
their
    repair hither and say you are not fit.
  Ham. Not a whit, we defy augury; the
re's a special providence
in
    the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not to come; if it
be

    not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will
come:
    the readiness is all. Si
nce no man knows aught of what he
leaves,
    what is't to leave betimes? Let be.

    Enter Kin
g, Queen, Laertes, Osric, and Lords, with other
              Attendants with foils and gauntlets.

               A table and flagons of wine on it.

  King. Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand
 from me.
                    [The King puts Laertes' hand into Hamlet's.]
  Ham. Give me your par
don, sir. I have done you wrong;
    But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.
    This presence knows
,
    And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd
    With sore distraction. What I have done

    That might your nature, honour, and exception
    Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.

    Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet.
    If Hamlet from himself be taken away,
    An
d when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
    Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
    Who
 does it, then? His madness. If't be so,
    Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
    His mad
ness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
    Sir, in this audience,
    Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd evi
l
    Free me so far in your most generous thoughts
    That I have shot my arrow o'er the house

    And hurt my brother.
  Laer. I am satisfied in nature,
    Whose motive in this case should st
ir me most
    To my revenge. But in my terms of honour
    I stand aloof, and will no reconcileme
nt
    Till by some elder masters of known honour
    I have a voice and precedent of peace
    T
o keep my name ungor'd. But till that time
    I do receive your offer'd love like love,
    And w
ill not wrong it.
  Ham. I embrace it freely,
    And will this brother's wager frankly play.
   
 Give us the foils. Come on.
  Laer. Come, one for me.
  Ham. I'll be your foil, Laertes. In mine 
ignorance
    Your skill shall, like a star i' th' darkest night,
    Stick fiery off indeed.
  L
aer. You mock me, sir.
  Ham. No, by this hand.
  King. Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin H
amlet,
    You know the wager?
  Ham. Very well, my lord.
    Your Grace has laid the odds o' th'
 weaker side.
  King. I do not fear it, I have seen you both;
    But since he is better'd, we hav
e therefore odds.
  Laer. This is too heavy; let me see another.
  Ham. This likes me well. These 
foils have all a length?
                                                Prepare to play.
  Osr. A
y, my good lord.
  King. Set me the stoups of wine upon that table.
    If Hamlet give the first o
r second hit,
    Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
    Let all the battlements their ordna
nce fire;
    The King shall drink to Hamlet's better breath,
    And in the cup an union shall he
 throw
    Richer than that which four successive kings
    In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me 
the cups;
    And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
    The trumpet to the cannoneer without,

    The cannons to the heavens, the heaven to earth,
    'Now the King drinks to Hamlet.' Come, beg
in.
    And you the judges, bear a wary eye.
  Ham. Come on, sir.
  Laer. Come, my lord.         
                       They play.
  Ham. One.
  Laer. No.
  Ham. Judgment!
  Osr. A hit, a very 
palpable hit.
  Laer. Well, again!
  King. Stay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
    
Here's to thy health.
               [Drum; trumpets sound; a piece goes off [within].
    Give hi
m the cup.
  Ham. I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile.
    Come. (They play.) Another hit.
 What say you?
  Laer. A touch, a touch; I do confess't.
  King. Our son shall win.
  Queen. He's
 fat, and scant of breath.
    Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows.
    The Queen carouses
 to thy fortune, Hamlet.
  Ham. Good madam!
  King. Gertrude, do not drink.
  Queen. I will, my l
ord; I pray you pardon me.          Drinks.
  King. [aside] It is the poison'd cup; it is too late.

  Ham. I dare not drink yet, madam; by-and-by.
  Queen. Come, let me wipe thy face.
  Laer. My l
ord, I'll hit him now.
  King. I do not think't.
  Laer. [aside] And yet it is almost against my c
onscience.
  Ham. Come for the third, Laertes! You but dally.
    Pray you pass with your best vio
lence;
    I am afeard you make a wanton of me.
  Laer. Say you so? Come on.                      
         Play.
  Osr. Nothing neither way.
  Laer. Have at you now!
                [Laertes woun
ds Hamlet; then] in scuffling, they
                    change rapiers, [and Hamlet wounds Laertes]
.
  King. Part them! They are incens'd.
  Ham. Nay come! again!                         The Queen 
falls.

  Osr. Look to the Queen there, ho!
  Hor. They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?

  Osr. How is't, Laertes?
  Laer. Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric.
    I am justly 
kill'd with mine own treachery.
  Ham. How does the Queen?
  King. She sounds to see them bleed.

  Queen. No, no! the drink, the drink! O my dear Hamlet!
    The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.  
               [Dies.]
  Ham. O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd.
    Treachery! Seek it out.

                                                [Laertes falls.]
  Laer. It is here, Hamlet. Hamlet
, thou art slain;
    No medicine in the world can do thee good.
    In thee there is not half an 
hour of life.
    The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
    Unbated and envenom'd. The foul p
ractice
    Hath turn'd itself on me. Lo, here I lie,
    Never to rise again. Thy mother's poison
'd.
    I can no more. The King, the King's to blame.
  Ham. The point envenom'd too?
    Then, v
enom, to thy work.                    Hurts the King.
  All. Treason! treason!
  King. O, yet defe
nd me, friends! I am but hurt.
  Ham. Here, thou incestuous, murd'rous, damned Dane,
    Drink off
 this potion! Is thy union here?
    Follow my mother.                                 King dies.

  Laer. He is justly serv'd.
    It is a poison temper'd by himself.
    Exchange forgiveness with
 me, noble Hamlet.
    Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
    Nor thine on me!        
                               Dies.
  Ham. Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.
    I am d
ead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!
    You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
    That a
re but mutes or audience to this act,
    Had I but time (as this fell sergeant, Death,
    Is str
ict in his arrest) O, I could tell you-
    But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;
    Thou liv'st; re
port me and my cause aright
    To the unsatisfied.
  Hor. Never believe it.
    I am more an ant
ique Roman than a Dane.
    Here's yet some liquor left.
  Ham. As th'art a man,
    Give me the 
cup. Let go! By heaven, I'll ha't.
    O good Horatio, what a wounded name
    (Things standing th
us unknown) shall live behind me!
    If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,
    Absent thee fro
m felicity awhile,
    And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
    To tell my story.     
    [March afar off, and shot within.]
    What warlike noise is this?
  Osr. Young Fortinbras, wi
th conquest come from Poland,
    To the ambassadors of England gives
    This warlike volley.
  
Ham. O, I die, Horatio!
    The potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit.
    I cannot live to hear
 the news from England,
    But I do prophesy th' election lights
    On Fortinbras. He has my dyi
ng voice.
    So tell him, with th' occurrents, more and less,
    Which have solicited- the rest 
is silence.             Dies.
  Hor. Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince,
    And f
lights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
                                                 [March wit
hin.]
    Why does the drum come hither?

    Enter Fortinbras and English Ambassadors, with Drum
,
                  Colours, and Attendants.

  Fort. Where is this sight?
  Hor. What is it you
 will see?
    If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
  Fort. This quarry cries on havoc. O
 proud Death,
    What feast is toward in thine eternal cell
    That thou so many princes at a sh
ot
    So bloodily hast struck.
  Ambassador. The sight is dismal;
    And our affairs from Engla
nd come too late.
    The ears are senseless that should give us hearing
    To tell him his comma
ndment is fulfill'd
    That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.
    Where should we have our t
hanks?
  Hor. Not from his mouth,
    Had it th' ability of life to thank you.
    He never gave 
commandment for their death.
    But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
    You from the Po
lack wars, and you from England,
    Are here arriv'd, give order that these bodies
    High on a 
stage be placed to the view;
    And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
    How these things 
came about. So shall you hear
    Of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts;
    Of accidental judgment
s, casual slaughters;
    Of deaths put on by cunning and forc'd cause;
    And, in this upshot, p
urposes mistook
    Fall'n on th' inventors' heads. All this can I
    Truly deliver.
  Fort. Let
 us haste to hear it,
    And call the noblest to the audience.
    For me, with sorrow I embrace 
my fortune.
    I have some rights of memory in this kingdom
    Which now, to claim my vantage do
th invite me.
  Hor. Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
    And from his mouth whose voice 
will draw on more.
    But let this same be presently perform'd,
    Even while men's minds are wi
ld, lest more mischance
    On plots and errors happen.
  Fort. Let four captains
    Bear Hamlet
 like a soldier to the stage;
    For he was likely, had he been put on,
    To have prov'd most r
oyally; and for his passage
    The soldiers' music and the rites of war
    Speak loudly for him.

    Take up the bodies. Such a sight as this
    Becomes the field but here shows much amiss.
  
  Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
            Exeunt marching; after the which a peal of ordnance
    
                                               are shot off.

ACT I. Scene I.
Elsinore. A platform before the Castle.

Enter two Sentinels-[f
irst,] Francisco, [who paces up and down
at his post; then] Bernardo, [who approaches him].

  Be
r. Who's there?
  Fran. Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.
  Ber. Long live the King!
  F
ran. Bernardo?
  Ber. He.
  Fran. You come most carefully upon your hour.
  Ber. 'Tis now struck 
twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.
  Fran. For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold,
    And
 I am sick at heart.
  Ber. Have you had quiet guard?
  Fran. Not a mouse stirring.
  Ber. Well, 
good night.
    If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
    The rivals of my watch, bid them make ha
ste.

                    Enter Horatio and Marcellus.

  Fran. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! 
Who is there?
  Hor. Friends to this ground.
  Mar. And liegemen to the Dane.
  Fran. Give you go
od night.
  Mar. O, farewell, honest soldier.
    Who hath reliev'd you?
  Fran. Bernardo hath my
 place.
    Give you good night.                                   Exit.
  Mar. Holla, Bernardo!

  Ber. Say-
    What, is Horatio there ?
  Hor. A piece of him.
  Ber. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome,
 good Marcellus.
  Mar. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
  Ber. I have seen nothing.

  Mar. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
    And will not let belief take hold of him
    Touchi
ng this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.
    Therefore I have entreated him along,
    With us to 
watch the minutes of this night,
    That, if again this apparition come,
    He may approve our e
yes and speak to it.
  Hor. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
  Ber. Sit down awhile,
    And let us
 once again assail your ears,
    That are so fortified against our story,
    What we two nights 
have seen.
  Hor. Well, sit we down,
    And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
  Ber. Last nigh
t of all,
    When yond same star that's westward from the pole
    Had made his course t' illume 
that part of heaven
    Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
    The bell then beating one-


                        Enter Ghost.

  Mar. Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!

  Ber. In the same figure, like the King that's dead.
  Mar. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horat
io.
  Ber. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.
  Hor. Most like. It harrows me with fear
 and wonder.
  Ber. It would be spoke to.
  Mar. Question it, Horatio.
  Hor. What art thou that 
usurp'st this time of night
    Together with that fair and warlike form
    In which the majesty 
of buried Denmark
    Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!
  Mar. It is offended.

  Ber. See, it stalks away!
  Hor. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!
                      
                               Exit Ghost.
  Mar. 'Tis gone and will not answer.
  Ber. How now, H
oratio? You tremble and look pale.
    Is not this something more than fantasy?
    What think you
 on't?
  Hor. Before my God, I might not this believe
    Without the sensible and true avouch
  
  Of mine own eyes.
  Mar. Is it not like the King?
  Hor. As thou art to thyself.
    Such was t
he very armour he had on
    When he th' ambitious Norway combated.
    So frown'd he once when, i
n an angry parle,
    He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
    'Tis strange.
  Mar. Thus twic
e before, and jump at this dead hour,
    With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
  Hor. In 
what particular thought to work I know not;
    But, in the gross and scope of my opinion,
    Thi
s bodes some strange eruption to our state.
  Mar. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows,

    Why this same strict and most observant watch
    So nightly toils the subject of the land,
  
  And why such daily cast of brazen cannon
    And foreign mart for implements of war;
    Why suc
h impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
    Does not divide the Sunday from the week.
    What m
ight be toward, that this sweaty haste
    Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day?
    Wh
o is't that can inform me?
  Hor. That can I.
    At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
 
   Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
    Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
    The
reto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
    Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet
    
(For so this side of our known world esteem'd him)
    Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd c
ompact,
    Well ratified by law and heraldry,
    Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands

    Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror;
    Against the which a moiety competent
    Was
 gaged by our king; which had return'd
    To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
    Had he been vanqu
isher, as, by the same cov'nant
    And carriage of the article design'd,
    His fell to Hamlet. 
Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
    Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
    Hath in the skirts of Norwa
y, here and there,
    Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
    For food and diet, to some ente
rprise
    That hath a stomach in't; which is no other,
    As it doth well appear unto our state,

    But to recover of us, by strong hand
    And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
    So
 by his father lost; and this, I take it,
    Is the main motive of our preparations,
    The sour
ce of this our watch, and the chief head
    Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
  Ber. I t
hink it be no other but e'en so.
    Well may it sort that this portentous figure
    Comes armed 
through our watch, so like the King
    That was and is the question of these wars.
  Hor. A mote 
it is to trouble the mind's eye.
    In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
    A little ere th
e mightiest Julius fell,
    The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead
    Did squeak and 
gibber in the Roman streets;
    As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood,
    Disasters in
 the sun; and the moist star
    Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
    Was sick almost 
to doomsday with eclipse.
    And even the like precurse of fierce events,
    As harbingers prece
ding still the fates
    And prologue to the omen coming on,
    Have heaven and earth together de
monstrated
    Unto our climature and countrymen.

                      Enter Ghost again.

  
  But soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again!
    I'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion
!
                                               Spreads his arms.
    If thou hast any sound, or 
use of voice,
    Speak to me.
    If there be any good thing to be done,
    That may to thee do
 ease, and, race to me,
    Speak to me.
    If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
    Which h
appily foreknowing may avoid,
    O, speak!
    Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
    Extorte
d treasure in the womb of earth
    (For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death),
        
                                         The cock crows.
    Speak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it
, Marcellus!
  Mar. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
  Hor. Do, if it will not stand.
  Ber
. 'Tis here!
  Hor. 'Tis here!
  Mar. 'Tis gone!
                                                
     Exit Ghost.
    We do it wrong, being so majestical,
    To offer it the show of violence;
 
   For it is as the air, invulnerable,
    And our vain blows malicious mockery.
  Ber. It was abo
ut to speak, when the cock crew.
  Hor. And then it started, like a guilty thing
    Upon a fearfu
l summons. I have heard
    The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
    Doth with his lofty and
 shrill-sounding throat
    Awake the god of day; and at his warning,
    Whether in sea or fire, 
in earth or air,
    Th' extravagant and erring spirit hies
    To his confine; and of the truth h
erein
    This present object made probation.
  Mar. It faded on the crowing of the cock.
    Som
e say that ever, 'gainst that season comes
    Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
    The 
bird of dawning singeth all night long;
    And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,
    Th
e nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,
    No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,

    So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
  Hor. So have I heard and do in part believe it.
  
  But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
    Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.
   
 Break we our watch up; and by my advice
    Let us impart what we have seen to-night
    Unto you
ng Hamlet; for, upon my life,
    This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
    Do you consent w
e shall acquaint him with it,
    As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
    Let's do't, I pra
y; and I this morning know
    Where we shall find him most conveniently.           Exeunt.





Scene II.
Elsinore. A room of state in the Castle.

Flourish. [Enter Claudius, King of Denmark,
 Gertrude the Queen,
Hamlet,
Polonius, Laertes and his sister Ophelia, [Voltemand, Cornelius,]
Lo
rds Attendant.

  King. Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
    The memory be green, an
d that it us befitted
    To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom
    To be contracted 
in one brow of woe,
    Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
    That we with wisest sorr
ow think on him
    Together with remembrance of ourselves.
    Therefore our sometime sister, now
 our queen,
    Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,
    Have we, as 'twere with a defeat
ed joy,
    With an auspicious, and a dropping eye,
    With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in m
arriage,
    In equal scale weighing delight and dole,
    Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'
d
    Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
    With this affair along. For all, our thanks.

    Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
    Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
    
Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
    Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
    Co
lleagued with this dream of his advantage,
    He hath not fail'd to pester us with message
    Im
porting the surrender of those lands
    Lost by his father, with all bands of law,
    To our mos
t valiant brother. So much for him.
    Now for ourself and for this time of meeting.
    Thus muc
h the business is: we have here writ
    To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,
    Who, impotent a
nd bedrid, scarcely hears
    Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress
    His further gait herei
n, in that the levies,
    The lists, and full proportions are all made
    Out of his subject; an
d we here dispatch
    You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,
    For bearers of this greeting t
o old Norway,
    Giving to you no further personal power
    To business with the King, more than
 the scope
    Of these dilated articles allow.            [Gives a paper.]
    Farewell, and let 
your haste commend your duty.
  Cor., Volt. In that, and all things, will we show our duty.
  King
. We doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell.
                                 Exeunt Voltemand and Cor
nelius.
    And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
    You told us of some suit. What is't, L
aertes?
    You cannot speak of reason to the Dane
    And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg,
 Laertes,
    That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
    The head is not more native to the h
eart,
    The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
    Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father
.
    What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
  Laer. My dread lord,
    Your leave and favour to return
 to France;
    From whence though willingly I came to Denmark
    To show my duty in your coronat
ion,
    Yet now I must confess, that duty done,
    My thoughts and wishes bend again toward Fran
ce
    And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
  King. Have you your father's leave? What 
says Polonius?
  Pol. He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
    By laboursome petition, an
d at last
    Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent.
    I do beseech you give him leave to go.

  King. Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,
    And thy best graces spend it at thy will!

    But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son-
  Ham. [aside] A little more than kin, and less than kin
d!
  King. How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
  Ham. Not so, my lord. I am too much i' t
h' sun.
  Queen. Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
    And let thine eye look like a frien
d on Denmark.
    Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
    Seek for thy noble father in the dust.

    Thou know'st 'tis common. All that lives must die,
    Passing through nature to eternity.
  
Ham. Ay, madam, it is common.
  Queen. If it be,
    Why seems it so particular with thee?
  Ham.
 Seems, madam, Nay, it is. I know not 'seems.'
    'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
    
Nor customary suits of solemn black,
    Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,
    No, nor the f
ruitful river in the eye,
    Nor the dejected havior of the visage,
    Together with all forms, 
moods, shapes of grief,
    'That can denote me truly. These indeed seem,
    For they are actions
 that a man might play;
    But I have that within which passeth show-
    These but the trappings
 and the suits of woe.
  King. 'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
    To give thes
e mourning duties to your father;
    But you must know, your father lost a father;
    That fathe
r lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
    In filial obligation for some term
    To do obsequio
us sorrow. But to persever
    In obstinate condolement is a course
    Of impious stubbornness. '
Tis unmanly grief;
    It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
    A heart unfortified, a mind i
mpatient,
    An understanding simple and unschool'd;
    For what we know must be, and is as comm
on
    As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
    Why should we in our peevish opposition
    Tak
e it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
    A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
    T
o reason most absurd, whose common theme
    Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
    Fr
om the first corse till he that died to-day,
    'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth
   
 This unprevailing woe, and think of us
    As of a father; for let the world take note
    You ar
e the most immediate to our throne,
    And with no less nobility of love
    Than that which dear
est father bears his son
    Do I impart toward you. For your intent
    In going back to school i
n Wittenberg,
    It is most retrograde to our desire;
    And we beseech you, bend you to remain

    Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
    Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
  Q
ueen. Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.
    I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wittenbe
rg.
  Ham. I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
  King. Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.
 
   Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come.
    This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet
    Sits s
miling to my heart; in grace whereof,
    No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day
    But the 
great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
    And the King's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,
    
Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.
                                Flourish. Exeunt all but Ham
let.
  Ham. O that this too too solid flesh would melt,
    Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!

    Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
    His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
    Ho
w weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
    Seem to me all the uses of this world!
    Fie on't! ah
, fie! 'Tis an unweeded garden
    That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
    Possess
 it merely. That it should come to this!
    But two months dead! Nay, not so much, not two.
    S
o excellent a king, that was to this
    Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
    That he m
ight not beteem the winds of heaven
    Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
    Must I r
emember? Why, she would hang on him
    As if increase of appetite had grown
    By what it fed on
; and yet, within a month-
    Let me not think on't! Frailty, thy name is woman!-
    A little mo
nth, or ere those shoes were old
    With which she followed my poor father's body
    Like Niobe,
 all tears- why she, even she
    (O God! a beast that wants discourse of reason
    Would have mo
urn'd longer) married with my uncle;
    My father's brother, but no more like my father
    Than 
I to Hercules. Within a month,
    Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
    Had left the flu
shing in her galled eyes,
    She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
    With such dexterity t
o incestuous sheets!
    It is not, nor it cannot come to good.
    But break my heart, for I must
 hold my tongue!

          Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo.

  Hor. Hail to your lordshi
p!
  Ham. I am glad to see you well.
    Horatio!- or I do forget myself.
  Hor. The same, my lor
d, and your poor servant ever.
  Ham. Sir, my good friend- I'll change that name with you.
    And
 what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?
    Marcellus?
  Mar. My good lord!
  Ham. I am very gla
d to see you.- [To Bernardo] Good even, sir.-

    But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?

  Hor. A truant disposition, good my lord.
  Ham. I would not hear your enemy say so,
    Nor shal
l you do my ear that violence
    To make it truster of your own report
    Against yourself. I kn
ow you are no truant.
    But what is your affair in Elsinore?
    We'll teach you to drink deep e
re you depart.
  Hor. My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
  Ham. I prithee do not mock m
e, fellow student.
    I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
  Hor. Indeed, my lord, it follo
wed hard upon.
  Ham. Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats
    Did coldly furnish fort
h the marriage tables.
    Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
    Or ever I had seen that da
y, Horatio!
    My father- methinks I see my father.
  Hor. O, where, my lord?
  Ham. In my mind'
s eye, Horatio.
  Hor. I saw him once. He was a goodly king.
  Ham. He was a man, take him for all
 in all.
    I shall not look upon his like again.
  Hor. My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.

  Ham. Saw? who?
  Hor. My lord, the King your father.
  Ham. The King my father?
  Hor. Season 
your admiration for a while
    With an attent ear, till I may deliver
    Upon the witness of the
se gentlemen,
    This marvel to you.
  Ham. For God's love let me hear!
  Hor. Two nights togeth
er had these gentlemen
    (Marcellus and Bernardo) on their watch
    In the dead vast and middle
 of the night
    Been thus encount'red. A figure like your father,
    Armed at point exactly, ca
p-a-pe,
    Appears before them and with solemn march
    Goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he
 walk'd
    By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
    Within his truncheon's length; whilst 
they distill'd
    Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
    Stand dumb and speak not to him. This
 to me
    In dreadful secrecy impart they did,
    And I with them the third night kept the watch
;
    Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
    Form of the thing, each word made true and g
ood,
    The apparition comes. I knew your father.
    These hands are not more like.
  Ham. But 
where was this?
  Mar. My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
  Ham. Did you not speak to it
?
  Hor. My lord, I did;
    But answer made it none. Yet once methought
    It lifted up it head
 and did address
    Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
    But even then the morning cock 
crew loud,
    And at the sound it shrunk in haste away
    And vanish'd from our sight.
  Ham. '
Tis very strange.
  Hor. As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
    And we did think it writ d
own in our duty
    To let you know of it.
  Ham. Indeed, indeed, sirs. But this troubles me.
   
 Hold you the watch to-night?
  Both [Mar. and Ber.] We do, my lord.
  Ham. Arm'd, say you?
  Bot
h. Arm'd, my lord.
  Ham. From top to toe?
  Both. My lord, from head to foot.
  Ham. Then saw yo
u not his face?
  Hor. O, yes, my lord! He wore his beaver up.
  Ham. What, look'd he frowningly.

  Hor. A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
  Ham. Pale or red?
  Hor. Nay, very pale.
  
Ham. And fix'd his eyes upon you?
  Hor. Most constantly.
  Ham. I would I had been there.
  Hor.
 It would have much amaz'd you.
  Ham. Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
  Hor. While one with
 moderate haste might tell a hundred.
  Both. Longer, longer.
  Hor. Not when I saw't.
  Ham. His
 beard was grizzled- no?
  Hor. It was, as I have seen it in his life,
    A sable silver'd.
  Ha
m. I will watch to-night.
    Perchance 'twill walk again.
  Hor. I warr'nt it will.
  Ham. If it
 assume my noble father's person,
    I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
    And bid
 me hold my peace. I pray you all,
    If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
    Let it be te
nable in your silence still;
    And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
    Give it an understand
ing but no tongue.
    I will requite your loves. So, fare you well.
    Upon the platform, 'twixt
 eleven and twelve,
    I'll visit you.
  All. Our duty to your honour.
  Ham. Your loves, as min
e to you. Farewell.
                                        Exeunt [all but Hamlet].
    My father
's spirit- in arms? All is not well.
    I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come!
    Ti
ll then sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,
    Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's
 eyes.
Exit.




Scene III.
Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius.

Enter Laertes and O
phelia.

  Laer. My necessaries are embark'd. Farewell.
    And, sister, as the winds give benefi
t
    And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
    But let me hear from you.
  Oph. Do you doubt th
at?
  Laer. For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,
    Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood;

    A violet in the youth of primy nature,
    Forward, not permanent- sweet, not lasting;
    T
he perfume and suppliance of a minute;
    No more.
  Oph. No more but so?
  Laer. Think it no mo
re.
    For nature crescent does not grow alone
    In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,

    The inward service of the mind and soul
    Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
    A
nd now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
    The virtue of his will; but you must fear,
    His gre
atness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
    For he himself is subject to his birth.
    He may no
t, as unvalued persons do,
    Carve for himself, for on his choice depends
    The safety and hea
lth of this whole state,
    And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd
    Unto the voice and
 yielding of that body
    Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
    It fits your 
wisdom so far to believe it
    As he in his particular act and place
    May give his saying deed
; which is no further
    Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
    Then weigh what loss you
r honour may sustain
    If with too credent ear you list his songs,
    Or lose your heart, or yo
ur chaste treasure open
    To his unmast'red importunity.
    Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear 
sister,
    And keep you in the rear of your affection,
    Out of the shot and danger of desire.

    The chariest maid is prodigal enough
    If she unmask her beauty to the moon.
    Virtue its
elf scopes not calumnious strokes.
    The canker galls the infants of the spring
    Too oft befo
re their buttons be disclos'd,
    And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
    Contagious blastmen
ts are most imminent.
    Be wary then; best safety lies in fear.
    Youth to itself rebels, thou
gh none else near.
  Oph. I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep
    As watchman to my heart.
 But, good my brother,
    Do not as some ungracious pastors do,
    Show me the steep and thorny 
way to heaven,
    Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
    Himself the primrose path of 
dalliance treads
    And recks not his own rede.
  Laer. O, fear me not!

                      
 Enter Polonius.

    I stay too long. But here my father comes.
    A double blessing is a doubl
e grace;
    Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
  Pol. Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for sh
ame!
    The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
    And you are stay'd for. There- my blessin
g with thee!
    And these few precepts in thy memory
    Look thou character. Give thy thoughts n
o tongue,
    Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.
    Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar
:
    Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
    Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops
 of steel;
    But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
    Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comr
ade. Beware
    Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,
    Bear't that th' opposed may beware of 
thee.
    Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice;
    Take each man's censure, but reserve th
y judgment.
    Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
    But not express'd in fancy; rich, not g
audy;
    For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
    And they in France of the best rank and stati
on
    Are most select and generous, chief in that.
    Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
    F
or loan oft loses both itself and friend,
    And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
    This 
above all- to thine own self be true,
    And it must follow, as the night the day,
    Thou canst
 not then be false to any man.
    Farewell. My blessing season this in thee!
  Laer. Most humbly 
do I take my leave, my lord.
  Pol. The time invites you. Go, your servants tend.
  Laer. Farewell
, Ophelia, and remember well
    What I have said to you.
  Oph. 'Tis in my memory lock'd,
    An
d you yourself shall keep the key of it.
  Laer. Farewell.                                         
 Exit.
  Pol. What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?
  Oph. So please you, something touching th
e Lord Hamlet.
  Pol. Marry, well bethought!
    'Tis told me he hath very oft of late
    Given 
private time to you, and you yourself
    Have of your audience been most free and bounteous.
    
If it be so- as so 'tis put on me,
    And that in way of caution- I must tell you
    You do not 
understand yourself so clearly
    As it behooves my daughter and your honour.
    What is between
 you? Give me up the truth.
  Oph. He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
    Of his affectio
n to me.
  Pol. Affection? Pooh! You speak like a green girl,
    Unsifted in such perilous circum
stance.
    Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
  Oph. I do not know, my lord, what I sh
ould think,
  Pol. Marry, I will teach you! Think yourself a baby
    That you have ta'en these te
nders for true pay,
    Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,
    Or (not to crack 
the wind of the poor phrase,
    Running it thus) you'll tender me a fool.
  Oph. My lord, he hath
 importun'd me with love
    In honourable fashion.
  Pol. Ay, fashion you may call it. Go to, go 
to!
  Oph. And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
    With almost all the holy vows of
 heaven.
  Pol. Ay, springes to catch woodcocks! I do know,
    When the blood burns, how prodigal
 the soul
    Lends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter,
    Giving more light than heat, exti
nct in both
    Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
    You must not take for fire. From thi
s time
    Be something scanter of your maiden presence.
    Set your entreatments at a higher rat
e
    Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
    Believe so much in him, that he is young,
  
  And with a larger tether may he walk
    Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia,
    Do not beli
eve his vows; for they are brokers,
    Not of that dye which their investments show,
    But mere
 implorators of unholy suits,
    Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
    The better to beg
uile. This is for all:
    I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth
    Have you so sland
er any moment leisure
    As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
    Look to't, I charge y
ou. Come your ways.
  Oph. I shall obey, my lord.
                                                
         Exeunt.




Scene IV.
Elsinore. The platform before the Castle.

Enter Hamlet, Hora
tio, and Marcellus.

  Ham. The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
  Hor. It is a nipping and a
n eager air.
  Ham. What hour now?
  Hor. I think it lacks of twelve.
  Mar. No, it is struck.
 
 Hor. Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws near the season
    Wherein the spirit held his wont to
 walk.
                   A flourish of trumpets, and two pieces go off.
    What does this mean, 
my lord?
  Ham. The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
    Keeps wassail, and the swagg'
ring upspring reels,
    And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
    The kettledrum and tr
umpet thus bray out
    The triumph of his pledge.
  Hor. Is it a custom?
  Ham. Ay, marry, is't;

    But to my mind, though I am native here
    And to the manner born, it is a custom
    More 
honour'd in the breach than the observance.
    This heavy-headed revel east and west
    Makes us
 traduc'd and tax'd of other nations;
    They clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase
    Soil 
our addition; and indeed it takes
    From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
    The p
ith and marrow of our attribute.
    So oft it chances in particular men
    That, for some viciou
s mole of nature in them,
    As in their birth,- wherein they are not guilty,
    Since nature ca
nnot choose his origin,-
    By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
    Oft breaking down the pales
 and forts of reason,
    Or by some habit that too much o'erleavens
    The form of plausive mann
ers, that these men
    Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
    Being nature's livery, or fo
rtune's star,
    Their virtues else- be they as pure as grace,
    As infinite as man may undergo
-
    Shall in the general censure take corruption
    From that particular fault. The dram of e'i
l
    Doth all the noble substance often dout To his own scandal.

                         Enter
 Ghost.

  Hor. Look, my lord, it comes!
  Ham. Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
    Be 
thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
    Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,

    Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
    Thou com'st in such a questionable shape
    That I
 will speak to thee. I'll call thee Hamlet,
    King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me?
    Let me
 not burst in ignorance, but tell
    Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,
    Have burst th
eir cerements; why the sepulchre
    Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
    Hath op'd his ponder
ous and marble jaws
    To cast thee up again. What may this mean
    That thou, dead corse, again
 in complete steel,
    Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
    Making night hideous, and we f
ools of nature
    So horridly to shake our disposition
    With thoughts beyond the reaches of ou
r souls?
    Say, why is this? wherefore? What should we do?
                                     
      Ghost beckons Hamlet.
  Hor. It beckons you to go away with it,
    As if it some impartment
 did desire
    To you alone.
  Mar. Look with what courteous action
    It waves you to a more r
emoved ground.
    But do not go with it!
  Hor. No, by no means!
  Ham. It will not speak. Then 
will I follow it.
  Hor. Do not, my lord!
  Ham. Why, what should be the fear?
    I do not set m
y life at a pin's fee;
    And for my soul, what can it do to that,
    Being a thing immortal as 
itself?
    It waves me forth again. I'll follow it.
  Hor. What if it tempt you toward the flood,
 my lord,
    Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
    That beetles o'er his base into the sea,

    And there assume some other, horrible form
    Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason

    And draw you into madness? Think of it.
    The very place puts toys of desperation,
    With
out more motive, into every brain
    That looks so many fadoms to the sea
    And hears it roar b
eneath.
  Ham. It waves me still.
    Go on. I'll follow thee.
  Mar. You shall not go, my lord.

  Ham. Hold off your hands!
  Hor. Be rul'd. You shall not go.
  Ham. My fate cries out
    And 
makes each petty artire in this body
    As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
                    
                            [Ghost beckons.]

    Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
    By
 heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!-
    I say, away!- Go on. I'll follow thee.
      
                                  Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet.
  Hor. He waxes desperate with imaginati
on.
  Mar. Let's follow. 'Tis not fit thus to obey him.
  Hor. Have after. To what issue will this
 come?
  Mar. Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
  Hor. Heaven will direct it.
  Mar. N
ay, let's follow him.
                                                         Exeunt.




Sce
ne V.
Elsinore. The Castle. Another part of the fortifications.

Enter Ghost and Hamlet.

  Ham
. Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak! I'll go no further.
  Ghost. Mark me.
  Ham. I will.
  Ghost.
 My hour is almost come,
    When I to sulph'rous and tormenting flames
    Must render up myself.

  Ham. Alas, poor ghost!
  Ghost. Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
    To what I shall 
unfold.
  Ham. Speak. I am bound to hear.
  Ghost. So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.

  Ham. What?
  Ghost. I am thy father's spirit,
    Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,

    And for the day confin'd to fast in fires,
    Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature

    Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid
    To tell the secrets of my prison house,
  
  I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
    Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,

    Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
    Thy knotted and combined locks to 
part,
    And each particular hair to stand on end
    Like quills upon the fretful porcupine.
  
  But this eternal blazon must not be
    To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
    If 
thou didst ever thy dear father love-
  Ham. O God!
  Ghost. Revenge his foul and most unnatural m
urther.
  Ham. Murther?
  Ghost. Murther most foul, as in the best it is;
    But this most foul,
 strange, and unnatural.
  Ham. Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
    As meditation 
or the thoughts of love,
    May sweep to my revenge.
  Ghost. I find thee apt;
    And duller sh
ouldst thou be than the fat weed
    That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
    Wouldst thou not
 stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.
    'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
    A serpent s
tung me. So the whole ear of Denmark
    Is by a forged process of my death
    Rankly abus'd. But
 know, thou noble youth,
    The serpent that did sting thy father's life
    Now wears his crown.

  Ham. O my prophetic soul!
    My uncle?
  Ghost. Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,

    With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts-
    O wicked wit and gifts, that have the po
wer
    So to seduce!- won to his shameful lust
    The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.
 
   O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there,
    From me, whose love was of that dignity
    That it
 went hand in hand even with the vow
    I made to her in marriage, and to decline
    Upon a wret
ch whose natural gifts were poor
    To those of mine!
    But virtue, as it never will be mov'd,

    Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
    So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,

    Will sate itself in a celestial bed
    And prey on garbage.
    But soft! methinks I scent t
he morning air.
    Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
    My custom always of the after
noon,
    Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
    With juice of cursed hebona in a vial,
    And
 in the porches of my ears did pour
    The leperous distilment; whose effect
    Holds such an en
mity with blood of man
    That swift as quicksilver it courses through
    The natural gates and 
alleys of the body,
    And with a sudden vigour it doth posset
    And curd, like eager droppings
 into milk,
    The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine;
    And a most instant tetter bark'd
 about,
    Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust
    All my smooth body.
    Thus was I
, sleeping, by a brother's hand
    Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd;
    Cut off e
ven in the blossoms of my sin,
    Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd,
    No reckoning made, but 
sent to my account
    With all my imperfections on my head.
  Ham. O, horrible! O, horrible! most
 horrible!
  Ghost. If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.
    Let not the royal bed of Denmark
 be
    A couch for luxury and damned incest.
    But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
    Tain
t not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
    Against thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven,
    A
nd to those thorns that in her bosom lodge
    To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once.
   
 The glowworm shows the matin to be near
    And gins to pale his uneffectual fire.
    Adieu, adi
eu, adieu! Remember me.                      Exit.

  Ham. O all you host of heaven! O earth! What
 else?
    And shall I couple hell? Hold, hold, my heart!
    And you, my sinews, grow not instant
 old,
    But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?
    Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a sea
t
    In this distracted globe. Remember thee?
    Yea, from the table of my memory
    I'll wipe
 away all trivial fond records,
    All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past
    That yout
h and observation copied there,
    And thy commandment all alone shall live
    Within the book a
nd volume of my brain,
    Unmix'd with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!
    O most pernicious woman!

    O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
    My tables! Meet it is I set it down
    Tha
t one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
    At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark.      
  [Writes.]
    So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word:
    It is 'Adieu, adieu! Remember me.'

    I have sworn't.
  Hor. (within) My lord, my lord!

                   Enter Horatio and Marce
llus.

  Mar. Lord Hamlet!
  Hor. Heaven secure him!
  Ham. So be it!
  Mar. Illo, ho, ho, my l
ord!
  Ham. Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.
  Mar. How is't, my noble lord?
  Hor. What new
s, my lord?
  Mar. O, wonderful!
  Hor. Good my lord, tell it.
  Ham. No, you will reveal it.
  
Hor. Not I, my lord, by heaven!
  Mar. Nor I, my lord.
  Ham. How say you then? Would heart of man
 once think it?
    But you'll be secret?
  Both. Ay, by heaven, my lord.
  Ham. There's neer a v
illain dwelling in all Denmark
    But he's an arrant knave.
  Hor. There needs no ghost, my lord,
 come from the grave
    To tell us this.
  Ham. Why, right! You are in the right!
    And so, wi
thout more circumstance at all,
    I hold it fit that we shake hands and part;
    You, as your b
usiness and desires shall point you,
    For every man hath business and desire,
    Such as it is
; and for my own poor part,
    Look you, I'll go pray.
  Hor. These are but wild and whirling wor
ds, my lord.
  Ham. I am sorry they offend you, heartily;
    Yes, faith, heartily.
  Hor. There'
s no offence, my lord.
  Ham. Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
    And much offence t
oo. Touching this vision here,
    It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.
    For your desir
e to know what is between us,
    O'ermaster't as you may. And now, good friends,
    As you are f
riends, scholars, and soldiers,
    Give me one poor request.
  Hor. What is't, my lord? We will.

  Ham. Never make known what you have seen to-night.
  Both. My lord, we will not.
  Ham. Nay, bu
t swear't.
  Hor. In faith,
    My lord, not I.
  Mar. Nor I, my lord- in faith.
  Ham. Upon my 
sword.
  Mar. We have sworn, my lord, already.
  Ham. Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.

          
       Ghost cries under the stage.

  Ghost. Swear.
  Ham. Aha boy, say'st thou so? Art thou the
re, truepenny?
    Come on! You hear this fellow in the cellarage.
    Consent to swear.
  Hor. P
ropose the oath, my lord.
  Ham. Never to speak of this that you have seen.
    Swear by my sword.

  Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
  Ham. Hic et ubique? Then we'll shift our ground.
    Come hither, ge
ntlemen,
    And lay your hands again upon my sword.
    Never to speak of this that you have hear
d:
    Swear by my sword.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear by his sword.
  Ham. Well said, old mole! Cans
t work i' th' earth so fast?
    A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends."
  Hor. O day an
d night, but this is wondrous strange!
  Ham. And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
    The
re are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
    Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
    Bu
t come!
    Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
    How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself

    (As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
    To put an antic disposition on),
    That you
, at such times seeing me, never shall,
    With arms encumb'red thus, or this head-shake,
    Or 
by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
    As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,
'
    Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'
    Or such ambiguous giving out,
 to note
    That you know aught of me- this is not to do,
    So grace and mercy at your most nee
d help you,
    Swear.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
                                                
   [They swear.]
  Ham. Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! So, gentlemen,
    With all my love I do com
mend me to you;
    And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
    May do t' express his love and friendi
ng to you,
    God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;
    And still your fingers on y
our lips, I pray.
    The time is out of joint. O cursed spite
    That ever I was born to set it 
right!
    Nay, come, let's go together.
                                                         
Exeunt.

Act II. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius.

Enter P
olonius and Reynaldo.

  Pol. Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
  Rey. I will, my lo
rd.
  Pol. You shall do marvell's wisely, good Reynaldo,
    Before You visit him, to make inquire

    Of his behaviour.
  Rey. My lord, I did intend it.
  Pol. Marry, well said, very well said. 
Look you, sir,
    Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
    And how, and who, what means, 
and where they keep,
    What company, at what expense; and finding
    By this encompassment and 
drift of question
    That they do know my son, come you more nearer
    Than your particular dema
nds will touch it.
    Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
    As thus, 'I know hi
s father and his friends,
    And in part him.' Do you mark this, Reynaldo?
  Rey. Ay, very well, 
my lord.
  Pol. 'And in part him, but,' you may say, 'not well.
    But if't be he I mean, he's ve
ry wild
    Addicted so and so'; and there put on him
    What forgeries you please; marry, none s
o rank
    As may dishonour him- take heed of that;
    But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual sli
ps
    As are companions noted and most known
    To youth and liberty.
  Rey. As gaming, my lord
.
  Pol. Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
    Drabbing. You may go so far.
  Rey.
 My lord, that would dishonour him.
  Pol. Faith, no, as you may season it in the charge.
    You 
must not put another scandal on him,
    That he is open to incontinency.
    That's not my meanin
g. But breathe his faults so quaintly
    That they may seem the taints of liberty,
    The flash 
and outbreak of a fiery mind,
    A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
    Of general assault.
  Re
y. But, my good lord-
  Pol. Wherefore should you do this?
  Rey. Ay, my lord,
    I would know t
hat.
  Pol. Marry, sir, here's my drift,
    And I believe it is a fetch of warrant.
    You layi
ng these slight sullies on my son
    As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' th' working,
    Mark y
ou,
    Your party in converse, him you would sound,
    Having ever seen in the prenominate crime
s
    The youth you breathe of guilty, be assur'd
    He closes with you in this consequence:
   
 'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman'-
    According to the phrase or the addition
    O
f man and country-
  Rey. Very good, my lord.
  Pol. And then, sir, does 'a this- 'a does- What wa
s I about to
say?
    By the mass, I was about to say something! Where did I leave?
  Rey. At 'cl
oses in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,' and
    gentleman.'
  Pol. At 'closes in the conseque
nce'- Ay, marry!
    He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman.
    I saw him yesterday, or t'other da
y,
    Or then, or then, with such or such; and, as you say,
    There was 'a gaming; there o'erto
ok in's rouse;
    There falling out at tennis'; or perchance,
    'I saw him enter such a house o
f sale,'
    Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
    See you now-
    Your bait of falsehood takes
 this carp of truth;
    And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
    With windlasses and with assay
s of bias,
    By indirections find directions out.
    So, by my former lecture and advice,
    
Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?
  Rey. My lord, I have.
  Pol. God b' wi' ye, fare ye
 well!
  Rey. Good my lord!                                    [Going.]
  Pol. Observe his inclina
tion in yourself.
  Rey. I shall, my lord.
  Pol. And let him ply his music.
  Rey. Well, my lord
.
  Pol. Farewell!
                                                  Exit Reynaldo.

           
            Enter Ophelia.

    How now, Ophelia? What's the matter?
  Oph. O my lord, my lord, I
 have been so affrighted!
  Pol. With what, i' th' name of God?
  Oph. My lord, as I was sewing in
 my closet,
    Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac'd,
    No hat upon his head, his stocking
s foul'd,
    Ungart'red, and down-gyved to his ankle;
    Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking e
ach other,
    And with a look so piteous in purport
    As if he had been loosed out of hell
   
 To speak of horrors- he comes before me.
  Pol. Mad for thy love?
  Oph. My lord, I do not know,

    But truly I do fear it.
  Pol. What said he?
  Oph. He took me by the wrist and held me hard;

    Then goes he to the length of all his arm,
    And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,

    He falls to such perusal of my face
    As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so.
    At last, a
 little shaking of mine arm,
    And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
    He rais'd a sigh
 so piteous and profound
    As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
    And end his being. That do
ne, he lets me go,
    And with his head over his shoulder turn'd
    He seem'd to find his way wi
thout his eyes,
    For out o' doors he went without their help
    And to the last bended their l
ight on me.
  Pol. Come, go with me. I will go seek the King.
    This is the very ecstasy of love
,
    Whose violent property fordoes itself
    And leads the will to desperate undertakings
    
As oft as any passion under heaven
    That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
    What, have y
ou given him any hard words of late?
  Oph. No, my good lord; but, as you did command,
    I did r
epel his letters and denied
    His access to me.
  Pol. That hath made him mad.
    I am sorry t
hat with better heed and judgment
    I had not quoted him. I fear'd he did but trifle
    And mea
nt to wrack thee; but beshrew my jealousy!
    By heaven, it is as proper to our age
    To cast b
eyond ourselves in our opinions
    As it is common for the younger sort
    To lack discretion. C
ome, go we to the King.
    This must be known; which, being kept close, might move
    More grief
 to hide than hate to utter love.
    Come.
                                                      
   Exeunt.

Scene II.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Flourish. [Enter King and Queen, Rosencr
antz and Guildenstern,
cum aliis.

  King. Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
    Moreo
ver that we much did long to see you,
    The need we have to use you did provoke
    Our hasty se
nding. Something have you heard
    Of Hamlet's transformation. So I call it,
    Sith nor th' ext
erior nor the inward man
    Resembles that it was. What it should be,
    More than his father's 
death, that thus hath put him
    So much from th' understanding of himself,
    I cannot dream of
. I entreat you both
    That, being of so young days brought up with him,
    And since so neighb
our'd to his youth and haviour,
    That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
    Some little
 time; so by your companies
    To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather
    So much as from occ
asion you may glean,
    Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus
    That, open'd, lies with
in our remedy.
  Queen. Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,
    And sure I am two men ther
e are not living
    To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
    To show us so much gentry 
and good will
    As to expend your time with us awhile
    For the supply and profit of our hope,

    Your visitation shall receive such thanks
    As fits a king's remembrance.
  Ros. Both your
 Majesties
    Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
    Put your dread pleasures more int
o command
    Than to entreaty.
  Guil. But we both obey,
    And here give up ourselves, in the 
full bent,
    To lay our service freely at your feet,
    To be commanded.
  King. Thanks, Rosen
crantz and gentle Guildenstern.
  Queen. Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz.
    And I be
seech you instantly to visit
    My too much changed son.- Go, some of you,
    And bring these ge
ntlemen where Hamlet is.
  Guil. Heavens make our presence and our practices
    Pleasant and help
ful to him!
  Queen. Ay, amen!
                 Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, [with some
 
                                                   Attendants].

                         Enter Po
lonius.

  Pol. Th' ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
    Are joyfully return'd.
  King. Th
ou still hast been the father of good news.
  Pol. Have I, my lord? Assure you, my good liege,
   
 I hold my duty as I hold my soul,
    Both to my God and to my gracious king;
    And I do think-
 or else this brain of mine
    Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
    As it hath us'd to do- t
hat I have found
    The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
  King. O, speak of that! That do I long t
o hear.
  Pol. Give first admittance to th' ambassadors.
    My news shall be the fruit to that gr
eat feast.
  King. Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
                                  
              [Exit Polonius.]
    He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found
    The head and s
ource of all your son's distemper.
  Queen. I doubt it is no other but the main,
    His father's 
death and our o'erhasty marriage.
  King. Well, we shall sift him.

              Enter Polonius,
 Voltemand, and Cornelius.

    Welcome, my good friends.
    Say, Voltemand, what from our broth
er Norway?
  Volt. Most fair return of greetings and desires.
    Upon our first, he sent out to s
uppress
    His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
    To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack,

    But better look'd into, he truly found
    It was against your Highness; whereat griev'd,
  
  That so his sickness, age, and impotence
    Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
    On
 Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys,
    Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,
    Makes v
ow before his uncle never more
    To give th' assay of arms against your Majesty.
    Whereon old
 Norway, overcome with joy,
    Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee
    And his commissi
on to employ those soldiers,
    So levied as before, against the Polack;
    With an entreaty, he
rein further shown,
                                                [Gives a paper.]
    That it m
ight please you to give quiet pass
    Through your dominions for this enterprise,
    On such reg
ards of safety and allowance
    As therein are set down.
  King. It likes us well;
    And at ou
r more consider'd time we'll read,
    Answer, and think upon this business.
    Meantime we thank
 you for your well-took labour.
    Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together.
    Most welco
me home!                       Exeunt Ambassadors.
  Pol. This business is well ended.
    My lieg
e, and madam, to expostulate
    What majesty should be, what duty is,
    Why day is day, night i
s night, and time is time.
    Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time.
    Therefore, sinc
e brevity is the soul of wit,
    And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
    I will be 
brief. Your noble son is mad.
    Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,
    What is't but to
 be nothing else but mad?
    But let that go.
  Queen. More matter, with less art.
  Pol. Madam,
 I swear I use no art at all.
    That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
    And pity 'ti
s 'tis true. A foolish figure!
    But farewell it, for I will use no art.
    Mad let us grant hi
m then. And now remains
    That we find out the cause of this effect-
    Or rather say, the caus
e of this defect,
    For this effect defective comes by cause.
    Thus it remains, and the remai
nder thus.
    Perpend.
    I have a daughter (have while she is mine),
    Who in her duty and o
bedience, mark,
    Hath given me this. Now gather, and surmise.
                                 
            [Reads] the letter.
    'To the celestial, and my soul's idol, the most beautified
   
   Ophelia,'-

    That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is a vile
      phrase.
   
 But you shall hear. Thus:
                                                        [Reads.]
    'I
n her excellent white bosom, these, &c.'
  Queen. Came this from Hamlet to her?
  Pol. Good madam,
 stay awhile. I will be faithful.     [Reads.]


          'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
     
       Doubt that the sun doth move;
          Doubt truth to be a liar;
            But never dou
bt I love.
      'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers; I have not art
to
    reckon my groa
ns; but that I love thee best, O most best,
believe
    it. Adieu.
      'Thine evermore, most de
ar lady, whilst this machine is to
him,

HAMLET.'

    This, in obedience, hath my daughter sho
wn me;
    And more above, hath his solicitings,
    As they fell out by time, by means, and place
,
    All given to mine ear.
  King. But how hath she
    Receiv'd his love?
  Pol. What do you 
think of me?
  King. As of a man faithful and honourable.
  Pol. I would fain prove so. But what m
ight you think,
    When I had seen this hot love on the wing
    (As I perceiv'd it, I must tell 
you that,
    Before my daughter told me), what might you,
    Or my dear Majesty your queen here,
 think,
    If I had play'd the desk or table book,
    Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb
,
    Or look'd upon this love with idle sight?
    What might you think? No, I went round to work

    And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
    'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star.
   
 This must not be.' And then I prescripts gave her,
    That she should lock herself from his resor
t,
    Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
    Which done, she took the fruits of my advice,

    And he, repulsed, a short tale to make,
    Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
    Thence 
to a watch, thence into a weakness,
    Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
    Into t
he madness wherein now he raves,
    And all we mourn for.
  King. Do you think 'tis this?
  Quee
n. it may be, very like.
  Pol. Hath there been such a time- I would fain know that-
    That I ha
ve Positively said ''Tis so,'
    When it prov'd otherwise.?
  King. Not that I know.
  Pol. [poi
nts to his head and shoulder] Take this from this, if
this
      be otherwise.
    If circumstanc
es lead me, I will find
    Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
    Within the centre.

  King. How may we try it further?
  Pol. You know sometimes he walks for hours together
    Here 
in the lobby.
  Queen. So he does indeed.
  Pol. At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him.
  
  Be you and I behind an arras then.
    Mark the encounter. If he love her not,
    And he not fr
om his reason fall'n thereon
    Let me be no assistant for a state,
    But keep a farm and carte
rs.
  King. We will try it.

                 Enter Hamlet, reading on a book.

  Queen. But lo
ok where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
  Pol. Away, I do beseech you, both away
    I'll bo
ard him presently. O, give me leave.
                       Exeunt King and Queen, [with Attendants
].
    How does my good Lord Hamlet?
  Ham. Well, God-a-mercy.
  Pol. Do you know me, my lord?
 
 Ham. Excellent well. You are a fishmonger.
  Pol. Not I, my lord.
  Ham. Then I would you were so
 honest a man.
  Pol. Honest, my lord?
  Ham. Ay, sir. To be honest, as this world goes, is to be 
one
man
    pick'd out of ten thousand.
  Pol. That's very true, my lord.
  Ham. For if the sun 
breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god
    kissing carrion- Have you a daughter?
  Pol. I have, 
my lord.
  Ham. Let her not walk i' th' sun. Conception is a blessing, but
not
    as your daught
er may conceive. Friend, look to't.
  Pol. [aside] How say you by that? Still harping on my daughte
r.
Yet
    he knew me not at first. He said I was a fishmonger. He is
far
    gone, far gone! An
d truly in my youth I suff'red much
extremity
    for love- very near this. I'll speak to him agai
n.- What do
you
    read, my lord?
  Ham. Words, words, words.
  Pol. What is the matter, my lor
d?
  Ham. Between who?
  Pol. I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
  Ham. Slanders, sir; fo
r the satirical rogue says here that old
men
    have grey beards; that their faces are wrinkled; 
their eyes
    purging thick amber and plum-tree gum; and that they have a
    plentiful lack of w
it, together with most weak hams. All
which,
    sir, though I most powerfully and potently believ
e, yet I
hold it
    not honesty to have it thus set down; for you yourself, sir,
    should be o
ld as I am if, like a crab, you could go backward.

  Pol. [aside] Though this be madness, yet the
re is a method
in't.-
   Will You walk out of the air, my lord?
  Ham. Into my grave?
  Pol. Ind
eed, that is out o' th' air. [Aside] How pregnant
sometimes
    his replies are! a happiness that 
often madness hits on,
which
    reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of.
I

    will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting
between
    him and my daughter.- My
 honourable lord, I will most humbly
take
    my leave of you.
  Ham. You cannot, sir, take from 
me anything that I will more
    willingly part withal- except my life, except my life, except
my

    life,

                    Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Pol. Fare you well, my lo
rd.
  Ham. These tedious old fools!
  Pol. You go to seek the Lord Hamlet. There he is.
  Ros. [t
o Polonius] God save you, sir!
                                                Exit [Polonius].


  Guil. My honour'd lord!
  Ros. My most dear lord!
  Ham. My excellent good friends! How dost tho
u, Guildenstern?
Ah,
    Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
  Ros. As the indifferent childr
en of the earth.
  Guil. Happy in that we are not over-happy.
    On Fortune's cap we are not the 
very button.
  Ham. Nor the soles of her shoe?
  Ros. Neither, my lord.
  Ham. Then you live abou
t her waist, or in the middle of her
    favours?
  Guil. Faith, her privates we.
  Ham. In the s
ecret parts of Fortune? O! most true! she is a
    strumpet. What news ?
  Ros. None, my lord, but
 that the world's grown honest.
  Ham. Then is doomsday near! But your news is not true. Let me
  
  question more in particular. What have you, my good friends,
    deserved at the hands of Fortune
 that she sends you to prison
    hither?
  Guil. Prison, my lord?
  Ham. Denmark's a prison.
  
Ros. Then is the world one.
  Ham. A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and
    
dungeons, Denmark being one o' th' worst.
  Ros. We think not so, my lord.
  Ham. Why, then 'tis n
one to you; for there is nothing either
good
    or bad but thinking makes it so. To me it is a pr
ison.
  Ros. Why, then your ambition makes it one. 'Tis too narrow for
your
    mind.
  Ham. O G
od, I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a
    king of infinite space, were it not tha
t I have bad dreams.
  Guil. Which dreams indeed are ambition; for the very substance
of
    the 
ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
  Ham. A dream itself is but a shadow.
  Ros. Truly, an
d I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality
that
    it is but a shadow's shadow.
  Ham. The
n are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and
outstretch'd
    heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall
 we to th' court? for, by
my
    fay, I cannot reason.
  Both. We'll wait upon you.
  Ham. No su
ch matter! I will not sort you with the rest of my
    servants; for, to speak to you like an hones
t man, I am most
    dreadfully attended. But in the beaten way of friendship,
what
    make you 
at Elsinore?
  Ros. To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
  Ham. Beggar that I am, I am even p
oor in thanks; but I thank
you;
    and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny.
W
ere
    you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free
    visitation? Come, deal justly
 with me. Come, come! Nay,
speak.
  Guil. What should we say, my lord?
  Ham. Why, anything- but 
to th' purpose. You were sent for; and
    there is a kind of confession in your looks, which your

modesties
    have not craft enough to colour. I know the good King and
Queen
    have sent for 
you.
  Ros. To what end, my lord?
  Ham. That you must teach me. But let me conjure you by the
ri
ghts
    of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the
    obligation of our ever-pres
erved love, and by what more dear
a
    better proposer could charge you withal, be even and direc
t
with
    me, whether you were sent for or no.
  Ros. [aside to Guildenstern] What say you?
  H
am. [aside] Nay then, I have an eye of you.- If you love me,
hold
    not off.
  Guil. My lord, w
e were sent for.
  Ham. I will tell you why. So shall my anticipation prevent your
    discovery, 
and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no
    feather. I have of late- but wherefore I know n
ot- lost all
my
    mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes
so
    heavily w
ith my disposition that this goodly frame, the
earth,
    seems to me a sterile promontory; this m
ost excellent canopy,
the
    air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this
majestical
 
   roof fretted with golden fire- why, it appeareth no other
thing
    to me than a foul and pesti
lent congregation of vapours. What
a
    piece of work is a man! how noble in reason! how infinite
 in
    faculties! in form and moving how express and admirable! in
    action how like an angel! 
in apprehension how like a god! the
    beauty of the world, the paragon of animals! And yet to me

what
    is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me- no, nor
woman
    neither, though by
 your smiling you seem to say so.
  Ros. My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.
  Ham. W
hy did you laugh then, when I said 'Man delights not me'?
  Ros. To think, my lord, if you delight 
not in man, what lenten
    entertainment the players shall receive from you. We coted
them
    o
n the way, and hither are they coming to offer you service.
  Ham. He that plays the king shall be 
welcome- his Majesty shall
    have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil
and

    target; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humorous man
shall
    end his part in peace; the
 clown shall make those laugh whose
    lungs are tickle o' th' sere; and the lady shall say her mi
nd
    freely, or the blank verse shall halt for't. What players are
    they?
  Ros. Even those 
you were wont to take such delight in, the
    tragedians of the city.
  Ham. How chances it they 
travel? Their residence, both in
    reputation and profit, was better both ways.
  Ros. I think t
heir inhibition comes by the means of the late
    innovation.
  Ham. Do they hold the same estima
tion they did when I was in
the
    city? Are they so follow'd?
  Ros. No indeed are they not.
 
 Ham. How comes it? Do they grow rusty?
  Ros. Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but t
here
is,
    sir, an eyrie of children, little eyases, that cry out on the
top
    of question a
nd are most tyrannically clapp'd for't. These
are now
    the fashion, and so berattle the common 
stages (so they call
    them) that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goosequills and
    dare sc
arce come thither.
  Ham. What, are they children? Who maintains 'em? How are they
    escoted? Wi
ll they pursue the quality no longer than they can
    sing? Will they not say afterwards, if they 
should grow
    themselves to common players (as it is most like, if their
means
    are no bette
r), their writers do them wrong to make them
exclaim
    against their own succession.
  Ros. Fai
th, there has been much to do on both sides; and the
nation
    holds it no sin to tarre them to c
ontroversy. There was, for
a
    while, no money bid for argument unless the poet and the
player

    went to cuffs in the question.
  Ham. Is't possible?
  Guil. O, there has been much throwing 
about of brains.
  Ham. Do the boys carry it away?
  Ros. Ay, that they do, my lord- Hercules and 
his load too.
  Ham. It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark,
and
    those that 
would make mows at him while my father lived give
    twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece
 for his picture
in
    little. 'Sblood, there is something in this more than
natural, if
    ph
ilosophy could find it out.

                     Flourish for the Players.

  Guil. There are t
he players.
  Ham. Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come!
Th'
    appurtenance
 of welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me
comply
    with you in this garb, lest my extent to th
e players (which I
    tell you must show fairly outwards) should more appear like
    entertainme
nt than yours. You are welcome. But my
uncle-father
    and aunt-mother are deceiv'd.
  Guil. In 
what, my dear lord?
  Ham. I am but mad north-north-west. When the wind is southerly
I
    know a
 hawk from a handsaw.

                            Enter Polonius.

  Pol. Well be with you, gen
tlemen!
  Ham. Hark you, Guildenstern- and you too- at each ear a hearer!
    That great baby you 
see there is not yet out of his swaddling
    clouts.
  Ros. Happily he's the second time come to 
them; for they say an
old
    man is twice a child.
  Ham. I will prophesy he comes to tell me of
 the players. Mark
it.-
   You say right, sir; a Monday morning; twas so indeed.
  Pol. My lord, 
I have news to tell you.
  Ham. My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an
actor in
  
  Rome-
  Pol. The actors are come hither, my lord.
  Ham. Buzz, buzz!
  Pol. Upon my honour-
  
Ham. Then came each actor on his ass-
  Pol. The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, come
dy,
    history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral,
    tragical-historical, tragica
l-comical-historical-pastoral;
scene
    individable, or poem unlimited. Seneca cannot be too heav
y,
nor
    Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these
are
    the only men.

  Ham. O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
  Pol. What treasure had he, my lor
d?
  Ham. Why,

         'One fair daughter, and no more,
           The which he loved passing 
well.'

  Pol. [aside] Still on my daughter.
  Ham. Am I not i' th' right, old Jephthah?
  Pol. 
If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I
    love passing well.
  Ham. Nay, that
 follows not.
  Pol. What follows then, my lord?
  Ham. Why,

           'As by lot, God wot,'


 and then, you know,

           'It came to pass, as most like it was.'

    The first row of
 the pious chanson will show you more; for
look
    where my abridgment comes.

                
     Enter four or five Players.

    You are welcome, masters; welcome, all.- I am glad to see
t
hee
    well.- Welcome, good friends.- O, my old friend? Why, thy
face is
    valanc'd since I sa
w thee last. Com'st' thou to' beard me in
    Denmark?- What, my young lady and mistress? By'r Lady
, your
    ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last by the
    altitude of a chopine.
 Pray God your voice, like a piece of
    uncurrent gold, be not crack'd within the ring.- Masters,
 you
are
    all welcome. We'll e'en to't like French falconers, fly at
    anything we see. We'l
l have a speech straight. Come, give us
a
    taste of your quality. Come, a passionate speech.
 
 1. Play. What speech, my good lord?
  Ham. I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never

acted;
    or if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember,
pleas'd
    not the million, '
twas caviary to the general; but it was (as
I
    receiv'd it, and others, whose judgments in such
 matters
cried in
    the top of mine) an excellent play, well digested in the
scenes,
    set d
own with as much modesty as cunning. I remember one said
    there were no sallets in the lines to 
make the matter
savoury,
    nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of
    affe
ctation; but call'd it an honest method, as wholesome as
    sweet, and by very much more handsome 
than fine. One speech
in't
    I chiefly lov'd. 'Twas AEneas' tale to Dido, and thereabout
of it

    especially where he speaks of Priam's slaughter. If it live
in
    your memory, begin at this
 line- let me see, let me see:

         'The rugged Pyrrhus, like th' Hyrcanian beast-'

    'T
is not so; it begins with Pyrrhus:

         'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
         B
lack as his purpose, did the night resemble
         When he lay couched in the ominous horse,
   
      Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd
         With heraldry more dismal. Head to 
foot
         Now is be total gules, horridly trick'd
         With blood of fathers, mothers, dau
ghters, sons,
         Bak'd and impasted with the parching streets,
         That lend a tyrannou
s and a damned light
         To their lord's murther. Roasted in wrath and fire,
         And thu
s o'ersized with coagulate gore,
         With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
         
Old grandsire Priam seeks.'

    So, proceed you.
  Pol. Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with goo
d accent and good
     discretion.

  1. Play. 'Anon he finds him,
      Striking too short at G
reeks. His antique sword,
      Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
      Repugnant to com
mand. Unequal match'd,
      Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide;
      But with the whi
ff and wind of his fell sword
      Th' unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
      Seeming
 to feel this blow, with flaming top
      Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
      Take
s prisoner Pyrrhus' ear. For lo! his sword,
      Which was declining on the milky head
      Of r
everend Priam, seem'd i' th' air to stick.
      So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
      And
, like a neutral to his will and matter,
      Did nothing.
      But, as we often see, against so
me storm,
      A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
      The bold winds speechless, a
nd the orb below
      As hush as death- anon the dreadful thunder
      Doth rend the region; so,
 after Pyrrhus' pause,
      Aroused vengeance sets him new awork;
      And never did the Cyclops
' hammers fall
      On Mars's armour, forg'd for proof eterne,
      With less remorse than Pyrrh
us' bleeding sword
      Now falls on Priam.
      Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods,

      In general synod take away her power;
      Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,

      And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
      As low as to the fiends!

  Pol. T
his is too long.
  Ham. It shall to the barber's, with your beard.- Prithee say
on.
    He's for 
a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps. Say on;
come to
    Hecuba.

  1. Play. 'But who, O who
, had seen the mobled queen-'

  Ham. 'The mobled queen'?
  Pol. That's good! 'Mobled queen' is g
ood.

  1. Play. 'Run barefoot up and down, threat'ning the flames
      With bisson rheum; a clo
ut upon that head
      Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
      About her lank and all 
o'erteemed loins,
      A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up-
      Who this had seen, with t
ongue in venom steep'd
      'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have pronounc'd.
      But if t
he gods themselves did see her then,
      When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
      In Minc
ing with his sword her husband's limbs,
      The instant burst of clamour that she made
      (Un
less things mortal move them not at all)
      Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven
  
    And passion in the gods.'

  Pol. Look, whe'r he has not turn'd his colour, and has tears
in'
s
    eyes. Prithee no more!
  Ham. 'Tis well. I'll have thee speak out the rest of this
soon.-

    Good my lord, will you see the players well bestow'd? Do you
    hear? Let them be well us'd; f
or they are the abstract and
brief
    chronicles of the time. After your death you were better ha
ve
a
    bad epitaph than their ill report while you live.
  Pol. My lord, I will use them accord
ing to their desert.
  Ham. God's bodykins, man, much better! Use every man after his
    desert, 
and who should scape whipping? Use them after your
own
    honour and dignity. The less they deser
ve, the more merit is
in
    your bounty. Take them in.
  Pol. Come, sirs.
  Ham. Follow him, fr
iends. We'll hear a play to-morrow.
                 Exeunt Polonius and Players [except the First]
.
    Dost thou hear me, old friend? Can you play 'The Murther of
    Gonzago'?
  1. Play. Ay, my
 lord.
  Ham. We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need, study a
    speech of some dozen 
or sixteen lines which I would set down
and
    insert in't, could you not?
  1. Play. Ay, my lor
d.
  Ham. Very well. Follow that lord- and look you mock him not.
                                
            [Exit First Player.]
    My good friends, I'll leave you till night. You are welcome
t
o
    Elsinore.
  Ros. Good my lord!
  Ham. Ay, so, God b' wi' ye!
                            [
Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
    Now I am alone.
    O what a rogue and peasant slave am I!

    Is it not monstrous that this player here,
    But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
    
Could force his soul so to his own conceit
    That, from her working, all his visage wann'd,
    
Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
    A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
   
 With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!
    For Hecuba!
    What's Hecuba to him, or he t
o Hecuba,
    That he should weep for her? What would he do,
    Had he the motive and the cue for
 passion
    That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
    And cleave the general ear with 
horrid speech;
    Make mad the guilty and appal the free,
    Confound the ignorant, and amaze in
deed
    The very faculties of eyes and ears.
    Yet I,
    A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, pea
k
    Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
    And can say nothing! No, not for a king,
  
  Upon whose property and most dear life
    A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
    Who call
s me villain? breaks my pate across?
    Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?
    Tweaks m
e by th' nose? gives me the lie i' th' throat
    As deep as to the lungs? Who does me this, ha?
 
   'Swounds, I should take it! for it cannot be
    But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall
    To m
ake oppression bitter, or ere this
    I should have fatted all the region kites
    With this sla
ve's offal. Bloody bawdy villain!
    Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
    O
, vengeance!
    Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
    That I, the son of a dear father m
urther'd,
    Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
    Must (like a whore) unpack my heart w
ith words
    And fall a-cursing like a very drab,
    A scullion!
    Fie upon't! foh! About, my
 brain! Hum, I have heard
    That guilty creatures, sitting at a play,
    Have by the very cunni
ng of the scene
    Been struck so to the soul that presently
    They have proclaim'd their malef
actions;
    For murther, though it have no tongue, will speak
    With most miraculous organ, I'l
l have these Players
    Play something like the murther of my father
    Before mine uncle. I'll 
observe his looks;
    I'll tent him to the quick. If he but blench,
    I know my course. The spi
rit that I have seen
    May be a devil; and the devil hath power
    T' assume a pleasing shape; 
yea, and perhaps
    Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
    As he is very potent with such spir
its,
    Abuses me to damn me. I'll have grounds
    More relative than this. The play's the thing

    Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King.         Exit.

ACT III. Sce
ne I.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz, Guilden
stern,
and Lords.

  King. And can you by no drift of circumstance
    Get from him why he puts 
on this confusion,
    Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
    With turbulent and dangerous l
unacy?
  Ros. He does confess he feels himself distracted,
    But from what cause he will by no m
eans speak.
  Guil. Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
    But with a crafty madness keeps 
aloof
    When we would bring him on to some confession
    Of his true state.
  Queen. Did he re
ceive you well?
  Ros. Most like a gentleman.
  Guil. But with much forcing of his disposition.
 
 Ros. Niggard of question, but of our demands
    Most free in his reply.
  Queen. Did you assay h
im
    To any pastime?
  Ros. Madam, it so fell out that certain players
    We o'erraught on the
 way. Of these we told him,
    And there did seem in him a kind of joy
    To hear of it. They ar
e here about the court,
    And, as I think, they have already order
    This night to play before
 him.
  Pol. 'Tis most true;
    And he beseech'd me to entreat your Majesties
    To hear and se
e the matter.
  King. With all my heart, and it doth much content me
    To hear him so inclin'd.

    Good gentlemen, give him a further edge
    And drive his purpose on to these delights.
  Ros
. We shall, my lord.
                            Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
  King. Swee
t Gertrude, leave us too;
    For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
    That he, as 'twere b
y accident, may here
    Affront Ophelia.
    Her father and myself (lawful espials)
    Will so 
bestow ourselves that, seeing unseen,
    We may of their encounter frankly judge
    And gather b
y him, as he is behav'd,
    If't be th' affliction of his love, or no,
    That thus he suffers f
or.
  Queen. I shall obey you;
    And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
    That your good beaut
ies be the happy cause
    Of Hamlet's wildness. So shall I hope your virtues
    Will bring him t
o his wonted way again,
    To both your honours.
  Oph. Madam, I wish it may.
                  
                                 [Exit Queen.]
  Pol. Ophelia, walk you here.- Gracious, so please 
you,
    We will bestow ourselves.- [To Ophelia] Read on this book,
    That show of such an exerc
ise may colour
    Your loneliness.- We are oft to blame in this,
    'Tis too much prov'd, that w
ith devotion's visage
    And pious action we do sugar o'er
    The Devil himself.
  King. [aside
] O, 'tis too true!
    How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
    The harlot's che
ek, beautied with plast'ring art,
    Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
    Than is my d
eed to my most painted word.
    O heavy burthen!
  Pol. I hear him coming. Let's withdraw, my lor
d.
                                      Exeunt King and Polonius].

                           E
nter Hamlet.

  Ham. To be, or not to be- that is the question:
    Whether 'tis nobler in the mi
nd to suffer
    The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
    Or to take arms against a sea of 
troubles,
    And by opposing end them. To die- to sleep-
    No more; and by a sleep to say we en
d
    The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks
    That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummatio
n
    Devoutly to be wish'd. To die- to sleep.
    To sleep- perchance to dream: ay, there's the r
ub!
    For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
    When we have shuffled off this mortal 
coil,
    Must give us pause. There's the respect
    That makes calamity of so long life.
    Fo
r who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
    Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely
,
    The pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay,
    The insolence of office, and the spurns
  
  That patient merit of th' unworthy takes,
    When he himself might his quietus make
    With a 
bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear,
    To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
    But that
 the dread of something after death-
    The undiscover'd country, from whose bourn
    No travell
er returns- puzzles the will,
    And makes us rather bear those ills we have
    Than fly to othe
rs that we know not of?
    Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
    And thus the native h
ue of resolution
    Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
    And enterprises of great 
pith and moment
    With this regard their currents turn awry
    And lose the name of action.- So
ft you now!
    The fair Ophelia!- Nymph, in thy orisons
    Be all my sins rememb'red.
  Oph. Go
od my lord,
    How does your honour for this many a day?
  Ham. I humbly thank you; well, well, w
ell.
  Oph. My lord, I have remembrances of yours
    That I have longed long to re-deliver.
    
I pray you, now receive them.
  Ham. No, not I!
    I never gave you aught.
  Oph. My honour'd lo
rd, you know right well you did,
    And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd
    As made t
he things more rich. Their perfume lost,
    Take these again; for to the noble mind
    Rich gift
s wax poor when givers prove unkind.
    There, my lord.
  Ham. Ha, ha! Are you honest?
  Oph. My
 lord?
  Ham. Are you fair?
  Oph. What means your lordship?
  Ham. That if you be honest and fai
r, your honesty should admit
no
    discourse to your beauty.
  Oph. Could beauty, my lord, have 
better commerce than with
honesty?
  Ham. Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform

    honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty
can
    translate beauty into hi
s likeness. This was sometime a
paradox,
    but now the time gives it proof. I did love you once.

  Oph. Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
  Ham. You should not have believ'd me; for virtu
e cannot so
    inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it. I loved
you
    not.
  Oph. I
 was the more deceived.
  Ham. Get thee to a nunnery! Why wouldst thou be a breeder of
    sinners
? I am myself indifferent honest, but yet I could
accuse
    me of such things that it were better
 my mother had not borne
me.
    I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more offences at
my

    beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give
    them shape, or time to act 
them in. What should such fellows
as I
    do, crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant kn
aves
all;
    believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where's your
    father?
  Oph. At h
ome, my lord.
  Ham. Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool
    nowhere but in'
s own house. Farewell.
  Oph. O, help him, you sweet heavens!
  Ham. If thou dost marry, I'll give
 thee this plague for thy
dowry:
    be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not
es
cape
    calumny. Get thee to a nunnery. Go, farewell. Or if thou wilt
    needs marry, marry a fo
ol; for wise men know well enough what
    monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go; and quickly
 too.
    Farewell.
  Oph. O heavenly powers, restore him!
  Ham. I have heard of your paintings 
too, well enough. God hath
    given you one face, and you make yourselves another. You jig,
you

    amble, and you lisp; you nickname God's creatures and make
your
    wantonness your ignorance.
 Go to, I'll no more on't! it hath
made
    me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages. Those t
hat are
    married already- all but one- shall live; the rest shall keep
as
    they are. To a n
unnery, go.                            Exit.
  Oph. O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
    T
he courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword,
    Th' expectancy and rose of the fair st
ate,
    The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
    Th' observ'd of all observers- quite, qui
te down!
    And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
    That suck'd the honey of his music vow
s,
    Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
    Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and
 harsh;
    That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
    Blasted with ecstasy. O, woe is me

    T' have seen what I have seen, see what I see!

                   Enter King and Polonius.


  King. Love? his affections do not that way tend;
    Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a
 little,
    Was not like madness. There's something in his soul
    O'er which his melancholy sit
s on brood;
    And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
    Will be some danger; which for to pr
event,
    I have in quick determination
    Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England
   
 For the demand of our neglected tribute.
    Haply the seas, and countries different,
    With va
riable objects, shall expel
    This something-settled matter in his heart,
    Whereon his brains
 still beating puts him thus
    From fashion of himself. What think you on't?
  Pol. It shall do 
well. But yet do I believe
    The origin and commencement of his grief
    Sprung from neglected 
love.- How now, Ophelia?
    You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said.
    We heard it all.- My 
lord, do as you please;
    But if you hold it fit, after the play
    Let his queen mother all al
one entreat him
    To show his grief. Let her be round with him;
    And I'll be plac'd so please
 you, in the ear
    Of all their conference. If she find him not,
    To England send him; or con
fine him where
    Your wisdom best shall think.
  King. It shall be so.
    Madness in great one
s must not unwatch'd go.         Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. hall in the Castle.

Enter 
Hamlet and three of the Players.

  Ham. Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounc'd it to you,

    trippingly on the tongue. But if you mouth it, as many of our
    players do, I had as live th
e town crier spoke my lines. Nor
do
    not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all

    gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and (as I may say)
    whirlwind of your passion, y
ou must acquire and beget a
    temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to
the
 
   soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion
to
    tatters, to very rags, to 
split the cars of the groundlings,
who
    (for the most part) are capable of nothing but inexplic
able
dumb
    shows and noise. I would have such a fellow whipp'd for
o'erdoing
    Termagant. I
t out-herods Herod. Pray you avoid it.
  Player. I warrant your honour.
  Ham. Be not too tame nei
ther; but let your own discretion be
your
    tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the 
action;
with
    this special observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of
    nature: for an
ything so overdone is from the purpose of
playing,
    whose end, both at the first and now, was a
nd is, to hold, as
    'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show Virtue her own
feature,
    scorn
 her own image, and the very age and body of the time
his
    form and pressure. Now this overdone
, or come tardy off,
though
    it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious
    gr
ieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance
    o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. 
O, there be players that
I
    have seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly (not
to

    speak it profanely), that, neither having the accent of
    Christians, nor the gait of Christi
an, pagan, nor man, have
so
    strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of Nature's
    jo
urneymen had made men, and not made them well, they
imitated
    humanity so abominably.
  Player
. I hope we have reform'd that indifferently with us,
sir.
  Ham. O, reform it altogether! And let
 those that play your
clowns
    speak no more than is set down for them. For there be of them
  
  that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren
    spectators to laugh too, though
 in the mean time some
necessary
    question of the play be then to be considered. That's
villan
ous
    and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it.
Go
    make you ready.
     
                                            Exeunt Players.

            Enter Polonius, Rosencran
tz, and Guildenstern.

    How now, my lord? Will the King hear this piece of work?
  Pol. And th
e Queen too, and that presently.
  Ham. Bid the players make haste, [Exit Polonius.] Will you two

    help to hasten them?
  Both. We will, my lord.                       Exeunt they two.
  Ham. W
hat, ho, Horatio!

                      Enter Horatio.

  Hor. Here, sweet lord, at your servic
e.
  Ham. Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
    As e'er my conversation cop'd withal.
  Hor. O
, my dear lord!
  Ham. Nay, do not think I flatter;
    For what advancement may I hope from thee,

    That no revenue hast but thy good spirits
    To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be
 flatter'd?
    No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
    And crook the pregnant hinges of 
the knee
    Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
    Since my dear soul was mistress 
of her choice
    And could of men distinguish, her election
    Hath seal'd thee for herself. For
 thou hast been
    As one, in suff'ring all, that suffers nothing;
    A man that Fortune's buffe
ts and rewards
    Hast ta'en with equal thanks; and blest are those
    Whose blood and judgment 
are so well commingled
    That they are not a pipe for Fortune's finger
    To sound what stop sh
e please. Give me that man
    That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
    In my heart's 
core, ay, in my heart of heart,
    As I do thee. Something too much of this I
    There is a play
 to-night before the King.
    One scene of it comes near the circumstance,
    Which I have told 
thee, of my father's death.
    I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
    Even with the very 
comment of thy soul
    Observe my uncle. If his occulted guilt
    Do not itself unkennel in one 
speech,
    It is a damned ghost that we have seen,
    And my imaginations are as foul
    As Vu
lcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
    For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,
    And after we
 will both our judgments join
    In censure of his seeming.
  Hor. Well, my lord.
    If he stea
l aught the whilst this play is playing,
    And scape detecting, I will pay the theft.

    march. [Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophe

      Guildenstern, and other Lords attendant, with the Guard
                  
     carrying torches.

  Ham. They are coming to the play. I must be idle.
    Get you a place.

  King. How fares our cousin Hamlet?
  Ham. Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish. I eat th
e
air,
    promise-cramm'd. You cannot feed capons so.
  King. I have nothing with this answer, H
amlet. These words are
not
    mine.
  Ham. No, nor mine now. [To Polonius] My lord, you play'd o
nce
    i' th' university, you say?
  Pol. That did I, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.
 
 Ham. What did you enact?
  Pol. I did enact Julius Caesar; I was kill'd i' th' Capitol;
Brutus
 
   kill'd me.
  Ham. It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf
there. Be
    the playe
rs ready.
  Ros. Ay, my lord. They stay upon your patience.
  Queen. Come hither, my dear Hamlet, 
sit by me.
  Ham. No, good mother. Here's metal more attractive.
  Pol. [to the King] O, ho! do yo
u mark that?
  Ham. Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
                                  [Sits down at
 Ophelia's feet.]

  Oph. No, my lord.
  Ham. I mean, my head upon your lap?
  Oph. Ay, my lord.

  Ham. Do you think I meant country matters?
  Oph. I think nothing, my lord.
  Ham. That's a fa
ir thought to lie between maids' legs.
  Oph. What is, my lord?
  Ham. Nothing.
  Oph. You are me
rry, my lord.
  Ham. Who, I?
  Oph. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. O God, your only jig-maker! What should a
 man do but be
merry?
    For look you how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father
died
    wi
thin 's two hours.
  Oph. Nay 'tis twice two months, my lord.
  Ham. So long? Nay then, let the de
vil wear black, for I'll have
a
    suit of sables. O heavens! die two months ago, and not
forgot
ten
    yet? Then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his
life
    half a year. But, by
'r Lady, he must build churches then; or
else
    shall he suffer not thinking on, with the hobby-
horse, whose

 play. The dumb show enters.

    Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing
   
 him and he her. She kneels, and makes show of protestation
    unto him. He takes her up, and decl
ines his head upon her
    neck. He lays him down upon a bank of flowers. She, seeing
    him asle
ep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his
    crown, kisses it, pours poison in the sle
eper's ears, and
    leaves him. The Queen returns, finds the King dead, and makes
    passionate 
action. The Poisoner with some three or four
Mutes,
    comes in again, seem to condole with her. 
The dead body is
    carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with gifts; she
    seems harsh an
d unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts
    his love.
                                         
                Exeunt.

  Oph. What means this, my lord?
  Ham. Marry, this is miching malhecho;
 it means mischief.
  Oph. Belike this show imports the argument of the play.

                  
    Enter Prologue.

  Ham. We shall know by this fellow. The players cannot keep
counsel;
    t
hey'll tell all.
  Oph. Will he tell us what this show meant?
  Ham. Ay, or any show that you'll s
how him. Be not you asham'd
to
    show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means.
  Oph. You ar
e naught, you are naught! I'll mark the play.

    Pro. For us, and for our tragedy,
      Here s
tooping to your clemency,
      We beg your hearing patiently.                     [Exit.]

  Ham
. Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
  Oph. 'Tis brief, my lord.
  Ham. As woman's love.


              Enter [two Players as] King and Queen.

    King. Full thirty times hath Phoebus' 
cart gone round
      Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
      And thirty dozen moons w
ith borrowed sheen
      About the world have times twelve thirties been,
      Since love our hea
rts, and Hymen did our hands,
      Unite comutual in most sacred bands.
    Queen. So many journe
ys may the sun and moon
      Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
      But woe is me! you 
are so sick of late,
      So far from cheer and from your former state.
      That I distrust you
. Yet, though I distrust,
      Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must;
      For women's fear a
nd love holds quantity,
      In neither aught, or in extremity.
      Now what my love is, proof 
hath made you know;
      And as my love is siz'd, my fear is so.
      Where love is great, the l
ittlest doubts are fear;
      Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.
    King. Fa
ith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;
      My operant powers their functions leave to do.

      And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
      Honour'd, belov'd, and haply one as ki
nd
      For husband shalt thou-
    Queen. O, confound the rest!
      Such love must needs be t
reason in my breast.
      When second husband let me be accurst!
      None wed the second but wh
o killed the first.

  Ham. [aside] Wormwood, wormwood!

    Queen. The instances that second ma
rriage move
      Are base respects of thrift, but none of love.
      A second time I kill my hus
band dead
      When second husband kisses me in bed.
    King. I do believe you think what now yo
u speak;
      But what we do determine oft we break.
      Purpose is but the slave to memory,
 
     Of violent birth, but poor validity;
      Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree,

      But fall unshaken when they mellow be.
      Most necessary 'tis that we forget
      To pay
 ourselves what to ourselves is debt.
      What to ourselves in passion we propose,
      The pas
sion ending, doth the purpose lose.
      The violence of either grief or joy
      Their own enac
tures with themselves destroy.
      Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
      Grief jo
ys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
      This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
      
That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
      For 'tis a question left us yet to prove
,
      Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
      The great man down, you mark his fa
vourite flies,
      The poor advanc'd makes friends of enemies;
      And hitherto doth love on f
ortune tend,
      For who not needs shall never lack a friend,
      And who in want a hollow fri
end doth try,
      Directly seasons him his enemy.
      But, orderly to end where I begun,
    
  Our wills and fates do so contrary run
      That our devices still are overthrown;
      Our th
oughts are ours, their ends none of our own.
      So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
     
 But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
    Queen. Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven
 light,
      Sport and repose lock from me day and night,
      To desperation turn my trust and 
hope,
      An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope,
      Each opposite that blanks the face of j
oy
      Meet what I would have well, and it destroy,
      Both here and hence pursue me lasting 
strife,
      If, once a widow, ever I be wife!

  Ham. If she should break it now!

    King. 
'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile.
      My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguil
e
      The tedious day with sleep.
    Queen. Sleep rock thy brain,
                            
                        [He] sleeps.
      And never come mischance between us twain!
Exit.

  H
am. Madam, how like you this play?
  Queen. The lady doth protest too much, methinks.
  Ham. O, bu
t she'll keep her word.
  King. Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in't?
  Ham. No, 
no! They do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i'
th'
    world.
  King. What do you call the p
lay?
  Ham. 'The Mousetrap.' Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the
    image of a murther done 
in Vienna. Gonzago is the duke's
name;
    his wife, Baptista. You shall see anon. 'Tis a knavish 
piece
of
    work; but what o' that? Your Majesty, and we that have free
    souls, it touches us
 not. Let the gall'd jade winch; our
withers
    are unwrung.

                         Enter Lu
cianus.

    This is one Lucianus, nephew to the King.
  Oph. You are as good as a chorus, my lor
d.
  Ham. I could interpret between you and your love, if I could
see
    the puppets dallying.

  Oph. You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
  Ham. It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge
.
  Oph. Still better, and worse.
  Ham. So you must take your husbands.- Begin, murtherer. Pox,

leave
    thy damnable faces, and begin! Come, the croaking raven doth
    bellow for revenge.


    Luc. Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
      Confederate season, else no
 creature seeing;
      Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,
      With Hecate's ban th
rice blasted, thrice infected,
      Thy natural magic and dire property
      On wholesome life u
surp immediately.
                                   Pours the poison in his ears.

  Ham. He poi
sons him i' th' garden for's estate. His name's
Gonzago.
    The story is extant, and written in v
ery choice Italian. You
    shall see anon how the murtherer gets the love of Gonzago's
wife.
  O
ph. The King rises.
  Ham. What, frighted with false fire?
  Queen. How fares my lord?
  Pol. Giv
e o'er the play.
  King. Give me some light! Away!
  All. Lights, lights, lights!
               
               Exeunt all but Hamlet and Horatio.
  Ham.   Why, let the strucken deer go weep,
   
       The hart ungalled play;
         For some must watch, while some must sleep:
          Thus
 runs the world away.
    Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers- if the rest of
my
    fo
rtunes turn Turk with me-with two Provincial roses on my
raz'd
    shoes, get me a fellowship in a
 cry of players, sir?
  Hor. Half a share.
  Ham.   A whole one I!
         For thou dost know, O
 Damon dear,
           This realm dismantled was
         Of Jove himself; and now reigns here
 
          A very, very- pajock.
  Hor. You might have rhym'd.
  Ham. O good Horatio, I'll take the
 ghost's word for a thousand
    pound! Didst perceive?
  Hor. Very well, my lord.
  Ham. Upon th
e talk of the poisoning?
  Hor. I did very well note him.
  Ham.   Aha! Come, some music! Come, th
e recorders!
         For if the King like not the comedy,
         Why then, belike he likes it n
ot, perdy.
    Come, some music!

                Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Guil. 
Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.
  Ham. Sir, a whole history.
  Guil. The King, sir-
 
 Ham. Ay, sir, what of him?
  Guil. Is in his retirement, marvellous distemper'd.
  Ham. With drin
k, sir?
  Guil. No, my lord; rather with choler.
  Ham. Your wisdom should show itself more richer
 to signify this
to
    the doctor; for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps
    plunge h
im into far more choler.
  Guil. Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame, and
start
    
not so wildly from my affair.
  Ham. I am tame, sir; pronounce.
  Guil. The Queen, your mother, in
 most great affliction of
spirit
    hath sent me to you.
  Ham. You are welcome.
  Guil. Nay, g
ood my lord, this courtesy is not of the right
breed.
    If it shall please you to make me a whol
esome answer, I will
do
    your mother's commandment; if not, your pardon and my return
    shal
l be the end of my business.
  Ham. Sir, I cannot.
  Guil. What, my lord?
  Ham. Make you a whole
some answer; my wit's diseas'd. But, sir,
such
    answer as I can make, you shall command; or rat
her, as you
say,
    my mother. Therefore no more, but to the matter! My mother,
you
    say-
 
 Ros. Then thus she says: your behaviour hath struck her into
    amazement and admiration.
  Ham.
 O wonderful son, that can so stonish a mother! But is
there no
    sequel at the heels of this mo
ther's admiration? Impart.
  Ros. She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to
bed.

  Ham. We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any
    further trade with us?
  Ros
. My lord, you once did love me.
  Ham. And do still, by these pickers and stealers!
  Ros. Good m
y lord, what is your cause of distemper? You do
surely
    bar the door upon your own liberty, if 
you deny your griefs
to
    your friend.
  Ham. Sir, I lack advancement.
  Ros. How can that be,
 when you have the voice of the King
himself
    for your succession in Denmark?
  Ham. Ay, sir, 
but 'while the grass grows'- the proverb is
something
    musty.

                     Enter the
 Players with recorders.

    O, the recorders! Let me see one. To withdraw with you- why
do
   
 you go about to recover the wind of me, as if you would drive
me
    into a toil?
  Guil. O my l
ord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too
unmannerly.
  Ham. I do not well understand that. Will
 you play upon this
pipe?
  Guil. My lord, I cannot.
  Ham. I pray you.
  Guil. Believe me, I ca
nnot.
  Ham. I do beseech you.
  Guil. I know, no touch of it, my lord.
  Ham. It is as easy as l
ying. Govern these ventages with your
    fingers and thumbs, give it breath with your mouth, and i
t
will
    discourse most eloquent music. Look you, these are the stops.
  Guil. But these cannot
 I command to any utt'rance of harmony. I
    have not the skill.
  Ham. Why, look you now, how un
worthy a thing you make of me!
You
    would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you
w
ould
    pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound me from my
    lowest note to the top 
of my compass; and there is much
music,
    excellent voice, in this little organ, yet cannot you 
make it
    speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am easier to be play'd on than
a
    pipe? Call me wha
t instrument you will, though you can fret
me,
    you cannot play upon me.

                   
     Enter Polonius.

    God bless you, sir!
  Pol. My lord, the Queen would speak with you, and
 presently.
  Ham. Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
  Pol. By th' mass, 
and 'tis like a camel indeed.
  Ham. Methinks it is like a weasel.
  Pol. It is back'd like a weas
el.
  Ham. Or like a whale.
  Pol. Very like a whale.
  Ham. Then will I come to my mother by-and
-by.- They fool me to
the
    top of my bent.- I will come by-and-by.
  Pol. I will say so.      
                                Exit.
  Ham. 'By-and-by' is easily said.- Leave me, friends.
     
                                   [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]

    'Tis now the very witching time o
f night,
    When churchyards yawn, and hell itself breathes out
    Contagion to this world. Now 
could I drink hot blood
    And do such bitter business as the day
    Would quake to look on. Sof
t! now to my mother!
    O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever
    The soul of Nero enter thi
s firm bosom.
    Let me be cruel, not unnatural;
    I will speak daggers to her, but use none.

    My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites-
    How in my words somever she be shent,
    To giv
e them seals never, my soul, consent!             Exit.




Scene III.
A room in the Castle.


Enter King, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.

  King. I like him not, nor stands it safe with us

    To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;
    I your commission will forthwith dispatch,

    And he to England shall along with you.
    The terms of our estate may not endure
    Hazar
d so near us as doth hourly grow
    Out of his lunacies.
  Guil. We will ourselves provide.
    
Most holy and religious fear it is
    To keep those many many bodies safe
    That live and feed 
upon your Majesty.
  Ros. The single and peculiar life is bound
    With all the strength and armo
ur of the mind
    To keep itself from noyance; but much more
    That spirit upon whose weal depe
nds and rests
    The lives of many. The cesse of majesty
    Dies not alone, but like a gulf doth
 draw
    What's near it with it. It is a massy wheel,
    Fix'd on the summit of the highest moun
t,
    To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
    Are mortis'd and adjoin'd; which when i
t falls,
    Each small annexment, petty consequence,
    Attends the boist'rous ruin. Never alone

    Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.
  King. Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voya
ge;
    For we will fetters put upon this fear,
    Which now goes too free-footed.
  Both. We wi
ll haste us.
                                               Exeunt Gentlemen.

                  
 Enter Polonius.

  Pol. My lord, he's going to his mother's closet.
    Behind the arras I'll co
nvey myself
    To hear the process. I'll warrant she'll tax him home;
    And, as you said, and w
isely was it said,
    'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,
    Since nature makes the
m partial, should o'erhear
    The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege.
    I'll call upon
 you ere you go to bed
    And tell you what I know.
  King. Thanks, dear my lord.
              
                                  Exit [Polonius].
    O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven;

    It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,
    A brother's murther! Pray can I not,
    Though i
nclination be as sharp as will.
    My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent,
    And, like a ma
n to double business bound,
    I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
    And both neglect. 
What if this cursed hand
    Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,
    Is there not rain 
enough in the sweet heavens
    To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
    But to confront
 the visage of offence?
    And what's in prayer but this twofold force,
    To be forestalled ere
 we come to fall,
    Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;
    My fault is past. But, O, wha
t form of prayer
    Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murther'?
    That cannot be; since I 
am still possess'd
    Of those effects for which I did the murther-
    My crown, mine own ambiti
on, and my queen.
    May one be pardon'd and retain th' offence?
    In the corrupted currents of
 this world
    Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,
    And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize
 itself
    Buys out the law; but 'tis not so above.
    There is no shuffling; there the action l
ies
    In his true nature, and we ourselves compell'd,
    Even to the teeth and forehead of our 
faults,
    To give in evidence. What then? What rests?
    Try what repentance can. What can it n
ot?
    Yet what can it when one cannot repent?
    O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
   
 O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
    Art more engag'd! Help, angels! Make assay.
    Bo
w, stubborn knees; and heart with strings of steel,
    Be soft as sinews of the new-born babe!
  
  All may be well.                                  He kneels.

let.

  Ham. Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
    And now I'll do't. And so he goes to h
eaven,
    And so am I reveng'd. That would be scann'd.
    A villain kills my father; and for tha
t,
    I, his sole son, do this same villain send
    To heaven.
    Why, this is hire and salary
, not revenge!
    He took my father grossly, full of bread,
    With all his crimes broad blown, 
as flush as May;
    And how his audit stands, who knows save heaven?
    But in our circumstance 
and course of thought,
    'Tis heavy with him; and am I then reveng'd,
    To take him in the pur
ging of his soul,
    When he is fit and seasoned for his passage?
    No.
    Up, sword, and kno
w thou a more horrid hent.
    When he is drunk asleep; or in his rage;
    Or in th' incestuous p
leasure of his bed;
    At gaming, swearing, or about some act
    That has no relish of salvation
 in't-
    Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,
    And that his soul may be as damn'
d and black
    As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays.
    This physic but prolongs thy sickly
 days.              Exit.
  King. [rises] My words fly up, my thoughts remain below.
    Words wit
hout thoughts never to heaven go.             Exit.




Scene IV.
The Queen's closet.

Enter
 Queen and Polonius.

  Pol. He will come straight. Look you lay home to him.
    Tell him his pr
anks have been too broad to bear with,
    And that your Grace hath screen'd and stood between
   
 Much heat and him. I'll silence me even here.
    Pray you be round with him.
  Ham. (within) Mot
her, mother, mother!
  Queen. I'll warrant you; fear me not. Withdraw; I hear him
coming.
       
                       [Polonius hides behind the arras.]

                          Enter Hamlet.


  Ham. Now, mother, what's the matter?
  Queen. Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
  
Ham. Mother, you have my father much offended.
  Queen. Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.

  Ham. Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
  Queen. Why, how now, Hamlet?
  Ham. What's t
he matter now?
  Queen. Have you forgot me?
  Ham. No, by the rood, not so!
    You are the Queen
, your husband's brother's wife,
    And (would it were not so!) you are my mother.
  Queen. Nay, 
then I'll set those to you that can speak.
  Ham. Come, come, and sit you down. You shall not budge
;
    You go not till I set you up a glass
    Where you may see the inmost part of you.
  Queen.
 What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murther me?
    Help, help, ho!
  Pol. [behind] What, ho! help, 
help, help!
  Ham. [draws] How now? a rat? Dead for a ducat, dead!
            [Makes a pass throu
gh the arras and] kills Polonius.
  Pol. [behind] O, I am slain!
  Queen. O me, what hast thou don
e?
  Ham. Nay, I know not. Is it the King?
  Queen. O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
  Ham
. A bloody deed- almost as bad, good mother,
    As kill a king, and marry with his brother.
  Que
en. As kill a king?
  Ham. Ay, lady, it was my word.
                         [Lifts up the arras 
and sees Polonius.]
    Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
    I took thee for thy bet
ter. Take thy fortune.
    Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.
    Leave wringing of your 
hands. Peace! sit you down
    And let me wring your heart; for so I shall
    If it be made of pe
netrable stuff;
    If damned custom have not braz'd it so
    That it is proof and bulwark agains
t sense.
  Queen. What have I done that thou dar'st wag thy tongue
    In noise so rude against me
?
  Ham. Such an act
    That blurs the grace and blush of modesty;
    Calls virtue hypocrite; t
akes off the rose
    From the fair forehead of an innocent love,
    And sets a blister there; ma
kes marriage vows
    As false as dicers' oaths. O, such a deed
    As from the body of contractio
n plucks
    The very soul, and sweet religion makes
    A rhapsody of words! Heaven's face doth g
low;
    Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
    With tristful visage, as against the doom,
   
 Is thought-sick at the act.
  Queen. Ah me, what act,
    That roars so loud and thunders in the 
index?
  Ham. Look here upon th's picture, and on this,
    The counterfeit presentment of two bro
thers.
    See what a grace was seated on this brow;
    Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himse
lf;
    An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
    A station like the herald Mercury
    New 
lighted on a heaven-kissing hill:
    A combination and a form indeed
    Where every god did seem
 to set his seal
    To give the world assurance of a man.
    This was your husband. Look you now
 what follows.
    Here is your husband, like a mildew'd ear
    Blasting his wholesome brother. H
ave you eyes?
    Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
    And batten on this moor? Ha! 
have you eyes
    You cannot call it love; for at your age
    The heyday in the blood is tame, it
's humble,
    And waits upon the judgment; and what judgment
    Would step from this to this? Se
nse sure you have,
    Else could you not have motion; but sure that sense
    Is apoplex'd; for m
adness would not err,
    Nor sense to ecstacy was ne'er so thrall'd
    But it reserv'd some quan
tity of choice
    To serve in such a difference. What devil was't
    That thus hath cozen'd you 
at hoodman-blind?
    Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
    Ears without hands or eyes,
 smelling sans all,
    Or but a sickly part of one true sense
    Could not so mope.
    O shame
! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
    If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
    To flamin
g youth let virtue be as wax
    And melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame
    When the compulsi
ve ardour gives the charge,
    Since frost itself as actively doth burn,
    And reason panders w
ill.
  Queen. O Hamlet, speak no more!
    Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul,
    And ther
e I see such black and grained spots
    As will not leave their tinct.
  Ham. Nay, but to live
 
   In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
    Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love
    Ov
er the nasty sty!
  Queen. O, speak to me no more!
    These words like daggers enter in mine ears
.
    No more, sweet Hamlet!
  Ham. A murtherer and a villain!
    A slave that is not twentieth 
part the tithe
    Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
    A cutpurse of the empire and the r
ule,
    That from a shelf the precious diadem stole
    And put it in his pocket!
  Queen. No mo
re!

                Enter the Ghost in his nightgown.

  Ham. A king of shreds and patches!-
 
   Save me and hover o'er me with your wings,
    You heavenly guards! What would your gracious fig
ure?
  Queen. Alas, he's mad!
  Ham. Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
    That, laps'd in
 time and passion, lets go by
    Th' important acting of your dread command?
    O, say!
  Ghost
. Do not forget. This visitation
    Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
    But look, amaz
ement on thy mother sits.
    O, step between her and her fighting soul
    Conceit in weakest bod
ies strongest works.
    Speak to her, Hamlet.
  Ham. How is it with you, lady?
  Queen. Alas, ho
w is't with you,
    That you do bend your eye on vacancy,
    And with th' encorporal air do hold
 discourse?
    Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
    And, as the sleeping soldiers in 
th' alarm,
    Your bedded hairs, like life in excrements,
    Start up and stand an end. O gentle
 son,
    Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
    Sprinkle cool patience! Whereon do you look
?
  Ham. On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!
    His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching 
to stones,
    Would make them capable.- Do not look upon me,
    Lest with this piteous action yo
u convert
    My stern effects. Then what I have to do
    Will want true colour- tears perchance 
for blood.
  Queen. To whom do you speak this?
  Ham. Do you see nothing there?
  Queen. Nothing 
at all; yet all that is I see.
  Ham. Nor did you nothing hear?
  Queen. No, nothing but ourselves
.
  Ham. Why, look you there! Look how it steals away!
    My father, in his habit as he liv'd!
 
   Look where he goes even now out at the portal!
                                                 
    Exit Ghost.
  Queen. This is the very coinage of your brain.
    This bodiless creation ecstas
y
    Is very cunning in.
  Ham. Ecstasy?
    My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time
    A
nd makes as healthful music. It is not madness
    That I have utt'red. Bring me to the test,
    
And I the matter will reword; which madness
    Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
    
Lay not that flattering unction to your soul
    That not your trespass but my madness speaks.
   
 It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
    Whiles rank corruption, mining all within,
    
Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
    Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
    And
 do not spread the compost on the weeds
    To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;
    Fo
r in the fatness of these pursy times
    Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg-
    Yea, curb and
 woo for leave to do him good.
  Queen. O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
  Ham. O, thr
ow away the worser part of it,
    And live the purer with the other half,
    Good night- but go 
not to my uncle's bed.
    Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
    That monster, custom, who all 
sense doth eat
    Of habits evil, is angel yet in this,
    That to the use of actions fair and g
ood
    He likewise gives a frock or livery,
    That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,
    And 
that shall lend a kind of easiness
    To the next abstinence; the next more easy;
    For use alm
ost can change the stamp of nature,
    And either [master] the devil, or throw him out
    With w
ondrous potency. Once more, good night;
    And when you are desirous to be blest,
    I'll blessi
ng beg of you.- For this same lord,
    I do repent; but heaven hath pleas'd it so,
    To punish 
me with this, and this with me,
    That I must be their scourge and minister.
    I will bestow h
im, and will answer well
    The death I gave him. So again, good night.
    I must be cruel, only
 to be kind;
    Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.
    One word more, good lady.
  Queen
. What shall I do?
  Ham. Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
    Let the bloat King tempt y
ou again to bed;
    Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
    And let him, for a pair o
f reechy kisses,
    Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,
    Make you to ravel all t
his matter out,
    That I essentially am not in madness,
    But mad in craft. 'Twere good you le
t him know;
    For who that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
    Would from a paddock, from a ba
t, a gib
    Such dear concernings hide? Who would do so?
    No, in despite of sense and secrecy,

    Unpeg the basket on the house's top,
    Let the birds fly, and like the famous ape,
    To 
try conclusions, in the basket creep
    And break your own neck down.
  Queen. Be thou assur'd, i
f words be made of breath,
    And breath of life, I have no life to breathe
    What thou hast sa
id to me.
  Ham. I must to England; you know that?
  Queen. Alack,
    I had forgot! 'Tis so conc
luded on.
  Ham. There's letters seal'd; and my two schoolfellows,
    Whom I will trust as I will
 adders fang'd,
    They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way
    And marshal me to knavery. L
et it work;
    For 'tis the sport to have the enginer
    Hoist with his own petar; and 't shall 
go hard
    But I will delve one yard below their mines
    And blow them at the moon. O, 'tis mos
t sweet
    When in one line two crafts directly meet.
    This man shall set me packing.
    I'l
l lug the guts into the neighbour room.-
    Mother, good night.- Indeed, this counsellor
    Is n
ow most still, most secret, and most grave,
    Who was in life a foolish peating knave.
    Come,
 sir, to draw toward an end with you.
    Good night, mother.
                  [Exit the Queen. T
hen] Exit Hamlet, tugging in
                                                       Polonius.

ACT IV. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King and Queen, with Rose
ncrantz and Guildenstern.

  King. There's matter in these sighs. These profound heaves
    You m
ust translate; 'tis fit we understand them.
    Where is your son?
  Queen. Bestow this place on u
s a little while.
                          [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
    Ah, mine ow
n lord, what have I seen to-night!
  King. What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
  Queen. Mad as the se
a and wind when both contend
    Which is the mightier. In his lawless fit
    Behind the arras he
aring something stir,
    Whips out his rapier, cries 'A rat, a rat!'
    And in this brainish app
rehension kills
    The unseen good old man.
  King. O heavy deed!
    It had been so with us, ha
d we been there.
    His liberty is full of threats to all-
    To you yourself, to us, to every o
ne.
    Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
    It will be laid to us, whose providence

    Should have kept short, restrain'd, and out of haunt
    This mad young man. But so much was o
ur love
    We would not understand what was most fit,
    But, like the owner of a foul disease,

    To keep it from divulging, let it feed
    Even on the pith of life. Where is he gone?
  Quee
n. To draw apart the body he hath kill'd;
    O'er whom his very madness, like some ore
    Among 
a mineral of metals base,
    Shows itself pure. He weeps for what is done.
  King. O Gertrude, co
me away!
    The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch
    But we will ship him hence; and this 
vile deed
    We must with all our majesty and skill
    Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildens
tern!

             Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

    Friends both, go join you with some
 further aid.
    Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
    And from his mother's closet hath he 
dragg'd him.
    Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body
    Into the chapel. I pray you h
aste in this.
                          Exeunt [Rosencrantz and Guildenstern].
    Come, Gertrude,
 we'll call up our wisest friends
    And let them know both what we mean to do
    And what's unt
imely done. [So haply slander-]
    Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter,
    As level as the c
annon to his blank,
    Transports his poisoned shot- may miss our name
    And hit the woundless 
air.- O, come away!
    My soul is full of discord and dismay.
                                   
                      Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A passage in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet
.

  Ham. Safely stow'd.
  Gentlemen. (within) Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!
  Ham. But soft! What noise?
 Who calls on Hamlet? O, here they
come.

               Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

 
 Ros. What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
  Ham. Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis
 kin.
  Ros. Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
    And bear it to the chapel.
  Ham.
 Do not believe it.
  Ros. Believe what?
  Ham. That I can keep your counsel, and not mine own. Be
sides,
to be
    demanded of a sponge, what replication should be made by the
son
    of a king?

  Ros. Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
  Ham. Ay, sir; that soaks up the King's countenance, h
is
rewards,
    his authorities. But such officers do the King best service
in
    the end. He k
eeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his
jaw;
    first mouth'd, to be last swallowed. When he
 needs what you
have
    glean'd, it is but squeezing you and, sponge, you shall be
dry
    agai
n.
  Ros. I understand you not, my lord.
  Ham. I am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a fool
ish ear.
  Ros. My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us
to
    the King.
  Ha
m. The body is with the King, but the King is not with the
body.
    The King is a thing-
  Guil.
 A thing, my lord?
  Ham. Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.
                  
                                       Exeunt.




Scene III.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.


Enter King.

  King. I have sent to seek him and to find the body.
    How dangerous is it tha
t this man goes loose!
    Yet must not we put the strong law on him.
    He's lov'd of the distra
cted multitude,
    Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;
    And where 'tis so, th' off
ender's scourge is weigh'd,
    But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,
    This sudde
n sending him away must seem
    Deliberate pause. Diseases desperate grown
    By desperate appli
ance are reliev'd,
    Or not at all.

                    Enter Rosencrantz.

    How now O Wh
at hath befall'n?
  Ros. Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
    We cannot get from him.
  
King. But where is he?
  Ros. Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
  King. Bring him 
before us.
  Ros. Ho, Guildenstern! Bring in my lord.

        Enter Hamlet and Guildenstern [wit
h Attendants].

  King. Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
  Ham. At supper.
  King. At supper? Wher
e?
  Ham. Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A certain
    convocation of politic worms are
 e'en at him. Your worm is
your
    only emperor for diet. We fat all creatures else to fat us,
a
nd
    we fat ourselves for maggots. Your fat king and your lean
beggar
    is but variable servi
ce- two dishes, but to one table. That's
the
    end.
  King. Alas, alas!
  Ham. A man may fish 
with the worm that hath eat of a king, and
eat
    of the fish that hath fed of that worm.
  King
. What dost thou mean by this?
  Ham. Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress
through

    the guts of a beggar.
  King. Where is Polonius?
  Ham. In heaven. Send thither to see. If y
our messenger find him
not
    there, seek him i' th' other place yourself. But indeed, if
you
 
   find him not within this month, you shall nose him as you go
up
    the stair, into the lobby.

  King. Go seek him there. [To Attendants.]
  Ham. He will stay till you come.
                  
                          [Exeunt Attendants.]
  King. Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety
,-
    Which we do tender as we dearly grieve
    For that which thou hast done,- must send thee h
ence
    With fiery quickness. Therefore prepare thyself.
    The bark is ready and the wind at he
lp,
    Th' associates tend, and everything is bent
    For England.
  Ham. For England?
  King.
 Ay, Hamlet.
  Ham. Good.
  King. So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
  Ham. I see a cherub t
hat sees them. But come, for England!
    Farewell, dear mother.
  King. Thy loving father, Hamlet
.
  Ham. My mother! Father and mother is man and wife; man and wife
is
    one flesh; and so, my 
mother. Come, for England!
Exit.
  King. Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard.
    Del
ay it not; I'll have him hence to-night.
    Away! for everything is seal'd and done
    That else
 leans on th' affair. Pray you make haste.
                            Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guild
enstern]
    And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught,-
    As my great power thereof may gi
ve thee sense,
    Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
    After the Danish sword, and thy f
ree awe
    Pays homage to us,- thou mayst not coldly set
    Our sovereign process, which imports
 at full,
    By letters congruing to that effect,
    The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England
;
    For like the hectic in my blood he rages,
    And thou must cure me. Till I know 'tis done,

    Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.             Exit.

Scene IV.
Ne
ar Elsinore.

Enter Fortinbras with his Army over the stage.

  For. Go, Captain, from me greet 
the Danish king.
    Tell him that by his license Fortinbras
    Craves the conveyance of a promis
'd march
    Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.
    If that his Majesty would aught with u
s,
    We shall express our duty in his eye;
    And let him know so.
  Capt. I will do't, my lor
d.
  For. Go softly on.
                                   Exeunt [all but the Captain].

      
 Enter Hamlet, Rosencrantz, [Guildenstern,] and others.

  Ham. Good sir, whose powers are these?

  Capt. They are of Norway, sir.
  Ham. How purpos'd, sir, I pray you?
  Capt. Against some part 
of Poland.
  Ham. Who commands them, sir?
  Capt. The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.
  Ham. Go
es it against the main of Poland, sir,
    Or for some frontier?
  Capt. Truly to speak, and with 
no addition,
    We go to gain a little patch of ground
    That hath in it no profit but the name
.
    To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
    Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole

    A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
  Ham. Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
  C
apt. Yes, it is already garrison'd.
  Ham. Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
    Will 
not debate the question of this straw.
    This is th' imposthume of much wealth and peace,
    Th
at inward breaks, and shows no cause without
    Why the man dies.- I humbly thank you, sir.
  Cap
t. God b' wi' you, sir.                             [Exit.]
  Ros. Will't please you go, my lord?

  Ham. I'll be with you straight. Go a little before.
                                        [Exeu
nt all but Hamlet.]
    How all occasions do inform against me
    And spur my dull revenge! What 
is a man,
    If his chief good and market of his time
    Be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no m
ore.
    Sure he that made us with such large discourse,
    Looking before and after, gave us not

    That capability and godlike reason
    To fust in us unus'd. Now, whether it be
    Bestial 
oblivion, or some craven scruple
    Of thinking too precisely on th' event,-
    A thought which,
 quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
    And ever three parts coward,- I do not know
    Why yet I
 live to say 'This thing's to do,'
    Sith I have cause, and will, and strength, and means
    To
 do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me.
    Witness this army of such mass and charge,
    Led b
y a delicate and tender prince,
    Whose spirit, with divine ambition puff'd,
    Makes mouths at
 the invisible event,
    Exposing what is mortal and unsure
    To all that fortune, death, and d
anger dare,
    Even for an eggshell. Rightly to be great
    Is not to stir without great argumen
t,
    But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
    When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,
 
   That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,
    Excitements of my reason and my blood,
    And
 let all sleep, while to my shame I see
    The imminent death of twenty thousand men
    That for
 a fantasy and trick of fame
    Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot
    Whereon the nu
mbers cannot try the cause,
    Which is not tomb enough and continent
    To hide the slain? O, f
rom this time forth,
    My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!            Exit.

Scene V.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter Horatio, Queen, and a Gentleman.

  Que
en. I will not speak with her.
  Gent. She is importunate, indeed distract.
    Her mood will need
s be pitied.
  Queen. What would she have?
  Gent. She speaks much of her father; says she hears

    There's tricks i' th' world, and hems, and beats her heart;
    Spurns enviously at straws; spe
aks things in doubt,
    That carry but half sense. Her speech is nothing,
    Yet the unshaped us
e of it doth move
    The hearers to collection; they aim at it,
    And botch the words up fit to
 their own thoughts;
    Which, as her winks and nods and gestures yield them,
    Indeed would ma
ke one think there might be thought,
    Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
  Hor. 'Twere go
od she were spoken with; for she may strew
    Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.
  Quee
n. Let her come in.
                                               [Exit Gentleman.]
    [Aside] T
o my sick soul (as sin's true nature is)
    Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
    So f
ull of artless jealousy is guilt
    It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.

                 E
nter Ophelia distracted.

  Oph. Where is the beauteous Majesty of Denmark?
  Queen. How now, Oph
elia?
  Oph. (sings)
         How should I your true-love know
           From another one?
    
     By his cockle bat and' staff
           And his sandal shoon.

  Queen. Alas, sweet lady, wh
at imports this song?
  Oph. Say you? Nay, pray You mark.

    (Sings) He is dead and gone, lady,

              He is dead and gone;
            At his head a grass-green turf,
              At 
his heels a stone.

    O, ho!
  Queen. Nay, but Ophelia-
  Oph. Pray you mark.

    (Sings) W
hite his shroud as the mountain snow-

                    Enter King.

  Queen. Alas, look here
, my lord!
  Oph. (Sings)
           Larded all with sweet flowers;
         Which bewept to the 
grave did not go
           With true-love showers.

  King. How do you, pretty lady?
  Oph. Wel
l, God dild you! They say the owl was a baker's
daughter.
    Lord, we know what we are, but know 
not what we may be. God
be at
    your table!
  King. Conceit upon her father.
  Oph. Pray let's
 have no words of this; but when they ask, you
what
    it means, say you this:

    (Sings) To-
morrow is Saint Valentine's day,
              All in the morning bedtime,
            And I a mai
d at your window,
              To be your Valentine.

            Then up he rose and donn'd his
 clo'es
              And dupp'd the chamber door,
            Let in the maid, that out a maid
 
             Never departed more.

  King. Pretty Ophelia!
  Oph. Indeed, la, without an oath, I'
ll make an end on't!

    [Sings] By Gis and by Saint Charity,
              Alack, and fie for s
hame!
            Young men will do't if they come to't
              By Cock, they are to blame.


            Quoth she, 'Before you tumbled me,
              You promis'd me to wed.'

    He 
answers:

            'So would I 'a' done, by yonder sun,
              An thou hadst not come t
o my bed.'

  King. How long hath she been thus?
  Oph. I hope all will be well. We must be patie
nt; but I cannot
    choose but weep to think they would lay him i' th' cold
ground.
    My broth
er shall know of it; and so I thank you for your good
    counsel. Come, my coach! Good night, ladi
es. Good night,
sweet
    ladies. Good night, good night.                         Exit
  King. Fo
llow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.
                                                 [
Exit Horatio.]

    O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs
    All from her father's dea
th. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
    When sorrows come, they come not single spies.
    But in battalions
! First, her father slain;
    Next, your son gone, and he most violent author
    Of his own just
 remove; the people muddied,
    Thick and and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers
    For 
good Polonius' death, and we have done but greenly
    In hugger-mugger to inter him; poor Ophelia

    Divided from herself and her fair judgment,
    Without the which we are pictures or mere beas
ts;
    Last, and as much containing as all these,
    Her brother is in secret come from France;

    And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
    Feeds on his wonder, keep, himself in clouds,
   
 With pestilent speeches of his father's death,
    Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
    Wil
l nothing stick our person to arraign
    In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
    Like to a 
murd'ring piece, in many places
    Give me superfluous death.                  A noise within.
  
Queen. Alack, what noise is this?
  King. Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.

      
               Enter a Messenger.

    What is the matter?
  Mess. Save Yourself, my lord:
    T
he ocean, overpeering of his list,
    Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
    Than Young
 Laertes, in a riotous head,
    O'erbears Your offices. The rabble call him lord;
    And, as the
 world were now but to begin,
    Antiquity forgot, custom not known,
    The ratifiers and props 
of every word,
    They cry 'Choose we! Laertes shall be king!'
    Caps, hands, and tongues appla
ud it to the clouds,
    'Laertes shall be king! Laertes king!'
                                  
               A noise within.
  Queen. How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!
    O, this is
 counter, you false Danish dogs!
  King. The doors are broke.

                    Enter Laertes 
with others.

  Laer. Where is this king?- Sirs, staid you all without.
  All. No, let's come in!

  Laer. I pray you give me leave.
  All. We will, we will!
  Laer. I thank you. Keep the door.  
    [Exeunt his Followers.]
    O thou vile king,
    Give me my father!
  Queen. Calmly, good La
ertes.
  Laer. That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard;
    Cries cuckold to my father
; brands the harlot
    Even here between the chaste unsmirched brows
    Of my true mother.
  Ki
ng. What is the cause, Laertes,
    That thy rebellion looks so giantlike?
    Let him go, Gertrud
e. Do not fear our person.
    There's such divinity doth hedge a king
    That treason can but pe
ep to what it would,
    Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,
    Why thou art thus incens'd
. Let him go, Gertrude.
    Speak, man.
  Laer. Where is my father?
  King. Dead.
  Queen. But n
ot by him!
  King. Let him demand his fill.
  Laer. How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
 
   To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil
    Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pi
t!
    I dare damnation. To this point I stand,
    That both the world, I give to negligence,
  
  Let come what comes; only I'll be reveng'd
    Most throughly for my father.
  King. Who shall s
tay you?
  Laer. My will, not all the world!
    And for my means, I'll husband them so well
    
They shall go far with little.
  King. Good Laertes,
    If you desire to know the certainty
    
Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge
    That sweepstake you will draw both frien
d and foe,
    Winner and loser?
  Laer. None but his enemies.
  King. Will you know them then?

  Laer. To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms
    And, like the kind life-rend'ring pelica
n,
    Repast them with my blood.
  King. Why, now You speak
    Like a good child and a true gen
tleman.
    That I am guiltless of your father's death,
    And am most sensibly in grief for it,

    It shall as level to your judgment pierce
    As day does to your eye.
                      
        A noise within: 'Let her come in.'
  Laer. How now? What noise is that?

                
      Enter Ophelia.

    O heat, dry up my brains! Tears seven times salt
    Burn out the sense
 and virtue of mine eye!
    By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight
    Till our scale tur
n the beam. O rose of May!
    Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
    O heavens! is't possible
 a young maid's wits
    Should be as mortal as an old man's life?
    Nature is fine in love, and
 where 'tis fine,
    It sends some precious instance of itself
    After the thing it loves.

 
 Oph. (sings)
         They bore him barefac'd on the bier
           (Hey non nony, nony, hey non
y)
         And in his grave rain'd many a tear.

    Fare you well, my dove!
  Laer. Hadst thou
 thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
    It could not move thus.
  Oph. You must sing 'A-down a-
down, and you call him a-down-a.'
O,
    how the wheel becomes it! It is the false steward, that s
tole
his
    master's daughter.
  Laer. This nothing's more than matter.
  Oph. There's rosemary
, that's for remembrance. Pray you, love,
    remember. And there is pansies, that's for thoughts.

  Laer. A document in madness! Thoughts and remembrance fitted.
  Oph. There's fennel for you, and
 columbines. There's rue for
you,
    and here's some for me. We may call it herb of grace o'
Sun
days.
    O, you must wear your rue with a difference! There's a daisy.
I
    would give you some
 violets, but they wither'd all when my
father
    died. They say he made a good end.

    [Sing
s] For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.

  Laer. Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,
  
  She turns to favour and to prettiness.
  Oph. (sings)
         And will he not come again?
    
     And will he not come again?
           No, no, he is dead;
           Go to thy deathbed;
  
       He never will come again.

         His beard was as white as snow,
         All flaxen wa
s his poll.
           He is gone, he is gone,
           And we cast away moan.
         God 'a'
mercy on his soul!

    And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God b' wi' you.
Exit.
  Laer. Do
 you see this, O God?
  King. Laertes, I must commune with your grief,
    Or you deny me right. G
o but apart,
    Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will,
    And they shall hear and jud
ge 'twixt you and me.
    If by direct or by collateral hand
    They find us touch'd, we will our
 kingdom give,
    Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours,
    To you in satisfaction; but
 if not,
    Be you content to lend your patience to us,
    And we shall jointly labour with your
 soul
    To give it due content.
  Laer. Let this be so.
    His means of death, his obscure fun
eral-
    No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,
    No noble rite nor formal ostentation
,-
    Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
    That I must call't in question.
  Kin
g. So you shall;
    And where th' offence is let the great axe fall.
    I pray you go with me.

                                                          Exeunt

Scene VII.
Elsinore. Another room in the Castle.

Enter King and Laertes.

  King.
 Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
    And You must put me in your heart for friend,
 
   Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
    That he which hath your noble father slain
   
 Pursued my life.
  Laer. It well appears. But tell me
    Why you proceeded not against these fea
ts
    So crimeful and so capital in nature,
    As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
    
You mainly were stirr'd up.
  King. O, for two special reasons,
    Which may to you, perhaps, see
m much unsinew'd,
    But yet to me they are strong. The Queen his mother
    Lives almost by his 
looks; and for myself,-
    My virtue or my plague, be it either which,-
    She's so conjunctive 
to my life and soul
    That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
    I could not but by her.
 The other motive
    Why to a public count I might not go
    Is the great love the general gende
r bear him,
    Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
    Would, like the spring that tu
rneth wood to stone,
    Convert his gives to graces; so that my arrows,
    Too slightly timber'd
 for so loud a wind,
    Would have reverted to my bow again,
    And not where I had aim'd them.

  Laer. And so have I a noble father lost;
    A sister driven into desp'rate terms,
    Whose wo
rth, if praises may go back again,
    Stood challenger on mount of all the age
    For her perfec
tions. But my revenge will come.
  King. Break not your sleeps for that. You must not think
    Th
at we are made of stuff so flat and dull
    That we can let our beard be shook with danger,
    A
nd think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more.
    I lov'd your father, and we love ourself,
  
  And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine-

                 Enter a Messenger with letters.


    How now? What news?
  Mess. Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:
    This to your Majesty; this to
 the Queen.
  King. From Hamlet? Who brought them?
  Mess. Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them 
not.
    They were given me by Claudio; he receiv'd them
    Of him that brought them.
  King. La
ertes, you shall hear them.
    Leave us.
                                                 Exit Me
ssenger.
    [Reads]'High and Mighty,-You shall know I am set naked on
your
    kingdom. To-morro
w shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes;
    when I shall (first asking your pardon thereunto) 
recount the
    occasion of my sudden and more strange return.
                                   
                  'HAMLET.'
    What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?
    Or is it so
me abuse, and no such thing?
  Laer. Know you the hand?
  King. 'Tis Hamlet's character. 'Naked!'

    And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'
    Can you advise me?
  Laer. I am lost in it, my
 lord. But let him come!
    It warms the very sickness in my heart
    That I shall live and tell
 him to his teeth,
    'Thus didest thou.'
  King. If it be so, Laertes
    (As how should it be 
so? how otherwise?),
    Will you be rul'd by me?
  Laer. Ay my lord,
    So you will not o'errul
e me to a peace.
  King. To thine own peace. If he be now return'd
    As checking at his voyage, 
and that he means
    No more to undertake it, I will work him
    To exploit now ripe in my devic
e,
    Under the which he shall not choose but fall;
    And for his death no wind shall breathe

    But even his mother shall uncharge the practice
    And call it accident.
  Laer. My lord, I w
ill be rul'd;
    The rather, if you could devise it so
    That I might be the organ.
  King. It
 falls right.
    You have been talk'd of since your travel much,
    And that in Hamlet's hearing
, for a quality
    Wherein they say you shine, Your sum of parts
    Did not together pluck such 
envy from him
    As did that one; and that, in my regard,
    Of the unworthiest siege.
  Laer. 
What part is that, my lord?
  King. A very riband in the cap of youth-
    Yet needfull too; for y
outh no less becomes
    The light and careless livery that it wears
    Than settled age his sabl
es and his weeds,
    Importing health and graveness. Two months since
    Here was a gentleman of
 Normandy.
    I have seen myself, and serv'd against, the French,
    And they can well on horseb
ack; but this gallant
    Had witchcraft in't. He grew unto his seat,
    And to such wondrous doi
ng brought his horse
    As had he been incorps'd and demi-natur'd
    With the brave beast. So fa
r he topp'd my thought
    That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
    Come short of what he did.

  Laer. A Norman was't?
  King. A Norman.
  Laer. Upon my life, Lamound.
  King. The very same.

  Laer. I know him well. He is the broach indeed
    And gem of all the nation.
  King. He made 
confession of you;
    And gave you such a masterly report
    For art and exercise in your defenc
e,
    And for your rapier most especially,
    That he cried out 'twould be a sight indeed
    I
f one could match you. The scrimers of their nation
    He swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye
,
    If you oppos'd them. Sir, this report of his
    Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
    Th
at he could nothing do but wish and beg
    Your sudden coming o'er to play with you.
    Now, out
 of this-
  Laer. What out of this, my lord?
  King. Laertes, was your father dear to you?
    Or
 are you like the painting of a sorrow,
    A face without a heart,'
  Laer. Why ask you this?
  
King. Not that I think you did not love your father;
    But that I know love is begun by time,
  
  And that I see, in passages of proof,
    Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
    There liv
es within the very flame of love
    A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
    And nothing i
s at a like goodness still;
    For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
    Dies in his own too-much. 
That we would do,
    We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes,
    And hath abatement
s and delays as many
    As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
    And then this 'should
' is like a spendthrift sigh,
    That hurts by easing. But to the quick o' th' ulcer!
    Hamlet 
comes back. What would you undertake
    To show yourself your father's son in deed
    More than 
in words?
  Laer. To cut his throat i' th' church!
  King. No place indeed should murther sanctuar
ize;
    Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,
    Will you do this? Keep close within
 your chamber.
    Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home.
    We'll put on those shall prai
se your excellence
    And set a double varnish on the fame
    The Frenchman gave you; bring you 
in fine together
    And wager on your heads. He, being remiss,
    Most generous, and free from a
ll contriving,
    Will not peruse the foils; so that with ease,
    Or with a little shuffling, y
ou may choose
    A sword unbated, and, in a pass of practice,
    Requite him for your father.
 
 Laer. I will do't!
    And for that purpose I'll anoint my sword.
    I bought an unction of a mo
untebank,
    So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
    Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare
,
    Collected from all simples that have virtue
    Under the moon, can save the thing from deat
h
    This is but scratch'd withal. I'll touch my point
    With this contagion, that, if I gall h
im slightly,
    It may be death.
  King. Let's further think of this,
    Weigh what convenience
 both of time and means
    May fit us to our shape. If this should fall,
    And that our drift l
ook through our bad performance.
    'Twere better not assay'd. Therefore this project
    Should 
have a back or second, that might hold
    If this did blast in proof. Soft! let me see.
    We'll
 make a solemn wager on your cunnings-
    I ha't!
    When in your motion you are hot and dry-
 
   As make your bouts more violent to that end-
    And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepar'd
 him
    A chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,
    If he by chance escape your venom'd stu
ck,
    Our purpose may hold there.- But stay, what noise,

                           Enter Quee
n.

    How now, sweet queen?
  Queen. One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
    So fast they 
follow. Your sister's drown'd, Laertes.
  Laer. Drown'd! O, where?
  Queen. There is a willow grow
s aslant a brook,
    That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream.
    There with fantastic ga
rlands did she come
    Of crowflowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,
    That liberal sheph
erds give a grosser name,
    But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them.
    There on the
 pendant boughs her coronet weeds
    Clamb'ring to hang, an envious sliver broke,
    When down h
er weedy trophies and herself
    Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide
    And, merm
aid-like, awhile they bore her up;
    Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes,
    As one i
ncapable of her own distress,
    Or like a creature native and indued
    Unto that element; but 
long it could not be
    Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
    Pull'd the poor wretc
h from her melodious lay
    To muddy death.
  Laer. Alas, then she is drown'd?
  Queen. Drown'd,
 drown'd.
  Laer. Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
    And therefore I forbid my tears; 
but yet
    It is our trick; nature her custom holds,
    Let shame say what it will. When these a
re gone,
    The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord.
    I have a speech of fire, that fain would b
laze
    But that this folly douts it.                          Exit.
  King. Let's follow, Gertru
de.
    How much I had to do to calm his rage I
    Now fear I this will give it start again;
   
 Therefore let's follow.
                                                         Exeunt.

ACT V. Scene I.
Elsinore. A churchyard.

Enter two Clowns, [with spades and pickaxes]
.

  Clown. Is she to be buried in Christian burial when she
wilfully
    seeks her own salvatio
n?
  Other. I tell thee she is; therefore make her grave straight.
    The crowner hath sate on he
r, and finds it Christian burial.
  Clown. How can that be, unless she drown'd herself in her own

    defence?
  Other. Why, 'tis found so.
  Clown. It must be se offendendo; it cannot be else. Fo
r here
lies
    the point: if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act; and
an
    act hath th
ree branches-it is to act, to do, and to perform;
    argal, she drown'd herself wittingly.
  Othe
r. Nay, but hear you, Goodman Delver!
  Clown. Give me leave. Here lies the water; good. Here stand
s
the
    man; good. If the man go to this water and drown himself, it
is,
    will he nill he, 
he goes- mark you that. But if the water
come to
    him and drown him, he drowns not himself. Arg
al, he that is
not
    guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.
  Other. But is this la
w?
  Clown. Ay, marry, is't- crowner's quest law.
  Other. Will you ha' the truth an't? If this ha
d not been a
    gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o' Christian
burial.
  Clown. Why, 
there thou say'st! And the more pity that great
folk
    should have count'nance in this world to 
drown or hang
themselves
    more than their even-Christian. Come, my spade! There is no
    anci
ent gentlemen but gard'ners, ditchers, and grave-makers.
They
    hold up Adam's profession.
  Ot
her. Was he a gentleman?
  Clown. 'A was the first that ever bore arms.
  Other. Why, he had none.

  Clown. What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the
Scripture?
    The Scripture says Ada
m digg'd. Could he dig without arms?
I'll
    put another question to thee. If thou answerest me n
ot to the
    purpose, confess thyself-
  Other. Go to!
  Clown. What is he that builds stronger 
than either the mason,
the
    shipwright, or the carpenter?
  Other. The gallows-maker; for that
 frame outlives a thousand
    tenants.
  Clown. I like thy wit well, in good faith. The gallows d
oes
well.
    But how does it well? It does well to those that do ill. Now,
    thou dost ill to 
say the gallows is built stronger than the
    church. Argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To't
 again,
come!
  Other. Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a
    carpenter?
  Clo
wn. Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
  Other. Marry, now I can tell!
  Clown. To't.
  Other. Mass, I
 cannot tell.

                 Enter Hamlet and Horatio afar off.

  Clown. Cudgel thy brains n
o more about it, for your dull ass
will
    not mend his pace with beating; and when you are ask'd
 this
    question next, say 'a grave-maker.' The houses he makes lasts
    till doomsday. Go, get
 thee to Yaughan; fetch me a stoup of
    liquor.
                                            [Exi
t Second Clown.]


                       [Clown digs and] sings.

       In youth when I did l
ove, did love,
         Methought it was very sweet;
       To contract- O- the time for- a- my be
hove,
         O, methought there- a- was nothing- a- meet.

  Ham. Has this fellow no feeling of
 his business, that he sings
at
    grave-making?
  Hor. Custom hath made it in him a property of
 easiness.
  Ham. 'Tis e'en so. The hand of little employment hath the
daintier
    sense.
  Clo
wn. (sings)
         But age with his stealing steps
           Hath clawed me in his clutch,
   
      And hath shipped me intil the land,
           As if I had never been such.
                
                            [Throws up a skull.]

  Ham. That skull had a tongue in it, and could 
sing once. How
the
    knave jowls it to the ground,as if 'twere Cain's jawbone,
that
    did th
e first murther! This might be the pate of a
Politician,
    which this ass now o'erreaches; one t
hat would circumvent
God,
    might it not?
  Hor. It might, my lord.
  Ham. Or of a courtier, w
hich could say 'Good morrow, sweet
lord!
    How dost thou, good lord?' This might be my Lord Such
-a-one,
that
    prais'd my Lord Such-a-one's horse when he meant to beg it-
might
    it not?

  Hor. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Why, e'en so! and now my Lady Worm's, chapless, and
knock'd
    about 
the mazzard with a sexton's spade. Here's fine
revolution,
    and we had the trick to see't. Did 
these bones cost no more
the
    breeding but to play at loggets with 'em? Mine ache to think
   
 on't.
  Clown. (Sings)
         A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,
           For and a shrouding s
heet;
         O, a Pit of clay for to be made
           For such a guest is meet.
             
                         Throws up [another skull].

  Ham. There's another. Why may not that be t
he skull of a
lawyer?
    Where be his quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, his
tenures,
    a
nd his tricks? Why does he suffer this rude knave now to
knock
    him about the sconce with a dir
ty shovel, and will not tell
him
    of his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be in's time

a
    great buyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizances,
his
    fines, his double vouc
hers, his recoveries. Is this the fine
of
    his fines, and the recovery of his recoveries, to ha
ve his
fine
    pate full of fine dirt? Will his vouchers vouch him no more
of
    his purchases
, and double ones too, than the length and
breadth
    of a pair of indentures? The very conveyanc
es of his lands
will
    scarcely lie in this box; and must th' inheritor himself have
no
    mo
re, ha?
  Hor. Not a jot more, my lord.
  Ham. Is not parchment made of sheepskins?
  Hor. Ay, my
 lord, And of calveskins too.
  Ham. They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in
that. I

    will speak to this fellow. Whose grave's this, sirrah?
  Clown. Mine, sir.

    [Sings] O, 
a pit of clay for to be made
              For such a guest is meet.

  Ham. I think it be thine 
indeed, for thou liest in't.
  Clown. You lie out on't, sir, and therefore 'tis not yours.
    For
 my part, I do not lie in't, yet it is mine.
  Ham. Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is th
ine. 'Tis
for
    the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.
  Clown. 'Tis a quick lie, s
ir; 'twill away again from me to you.
  Ham. What man dost thou dig it for?
  Clown. For no man, s
ir.
  Ham. What woman then?
  Clown. For none neither.
  Ham. Who is to be buried in't?
  Clown.
 One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's
dead.
  Ham. How absolute the knave is! We m
ust speak by the card, or
    equivocation will undo us. By the Lord, Horatio, this three
years
 
   I have taken note of it, the age is grown so picked that the
toe
    of the peasant comes so ne
ar the heel of the courtier he
galls
    his kibe.- How long hast thou been a grave-maker?
  Clow
n. Of all the days i' th' year, I came to't that day that
our
    last king Hamlet overcame Fortin
bras.
  Ham. How long is that since?
  Clown. Cannot you tell that? Every fool can tell that. It w
as
the
    very day that young Hamlet was born- he that is mad, and sent
    into England.
  Ham
. Ay, marry, why was be sent into England?
  Clown. Why, because 'a was mad. 'A shall recover his w
its
there;
    or, if 'a do not, 'tis no great matter there.
  Ham. Why?
  Clown. 'Twill not he 
seen in him there. There the men are as
mad as
    he.
  Ham. How came he mad?
  Clown. Very str
angely, they say.
  Ham. How strangely?
  Clown. Faith, e'en with losing his wits.
  Ham. Upon wh
at ground?
  Clown. Why, here in Denmark. I have been sexton here, man and
boy
    thirty years.

  Ham. How long will a man lie i' th' earth ere he rot?
  Clown. Faith, if 'a be not rotten before
 'a die (as we have
many
    pocky corses now-a-days that will scarce hold the laying in,
I
    
will last you some eight year or nine year. A tanner will
last
    you nine year.
  Ham. Why he m
ore than another?
  Clown. Why, sir, his hide is so tann'd with his trade that 'a
will
    keep o
ut water a great while; and your water is a sore
decayer of
    your whoreson dead body. Here's a 
skull now. This skull hath
lien
    you i' th' earth three-and-twenty years.
  Ham. Whose was it?

  Clown. A whoreson, mad fellow's it was. Whose do you think it
was?
  Ham. Nay, I know not.
  
Clown. A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! 'A pour'd a flagon
of
    Rhenish on my head once. Thi
s same skull, sir, was Yorick's
    skull, the King's jester.
  Ham. This?
  Clown. E'en that.
 
 Ham. Let me see. [Takes the skull.] Alas, poor Yorick! I knew
him,
    Horatio. A fellow of infin
ite jest, of most excellent fancy.
He
    hath borne me on his back a thousand times. And now how

abhorred
    in my imagination it is! My gorge rises at it. Here hung
those
    lips that I have
 kiss'd I know not how oft. Where be your
gibes
    now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of
 merriment that
    were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock
your
    own grinn
ing? Quite chap- fall'n? Now get you to my lady's
    chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch 
thick, to this
    favour she must come. Make her laugh at that. Prithee,
Horatio,
    tell me on
e thing.
  Hor. What's that, my lord?
  Ham. Dost thou think Alexander look'd o' this fashion i' t
h'
earth?
  Hor. E'en so.
  Ham. And smelt so? Pah!
                                          [P
uts down the skull.]
  Hor. E'en so, my lord.
  Ham. To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why
 may not
    imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it
    stopping a bunghole
?
  Hor. 'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.
  Ham. No, faith, not a jot; but to fol
low him thither with
modesty
    enough, and likelihood to lead it; as thus: Alexander died,
    
Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust
is
    earth; of earth we make loam;
 and why of that loam (whereto
he
    was converted) might they not stop a beer barrel?
    Imper
ious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
    Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.
    O, that tha
t earth which kept the world in awe
    Should patch a wall t' expel the winter's flaw!
    But so
ft! but soft! aside! Here comes the King-

    Enter [priests with] a coffin [in funeral processio
n], King,
             Queen, Laertes, with Lords attendant.]

    The Queen, the courtiers. Who 
is this they follow?
    And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken
    The corse they follow d
id with desp'rate hand
    Fordo it own life. 'Twas of some estate.
    Couch we awhile, and mark.

                                         [Retires with Horatio.]

  Laer. What ceremony else?
 
 Ham. That is Laertes,
    A very noble youth. Mark.
  Laer. What ceremony else?
  Priest. Her ob
sequies have been as far enlarg'd
    As we have warranty. Her death was doubtful;
    And, but th
at great command o'ersways the order,
    She should in ground unsanctified have lodg'd
    Till t
he last trumpet. For charitable prayers,
    Shards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on her.

    Yet here she is allow'd her virgin rites,
    Her maiden strewments, and the bringing home
   
 Of bell and burial.
  Laer. Must there no more be done?
  Priest. No more be done.
    We should
 profane the service of the dead
    To sing a requiem and such rest to her
    As to peace-parted
 souls.
  Laer. Lay her i' th' earth;
    And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
    May violets 
spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,
    A minist'ring angel shall my sister be
    When thou lie
st howling.
  Ham. What, the fair Ophelia?
  Queen. Sweets to the sweet! Farewell.
              
                               [Scatters flowers.]
    I hop'd thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's 
wife;
    I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
    And not have strew'd thy grave.

  Laer. O, treble woe
    Fall ten times treble on that cursed head
    Whose wicked deed thy mos
t ingenious sense
    Depriv'd thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,
    Till I have caught her once
 more in mine arms.
                                             Leaps in the grave.
    Now pile 
your dust upon the quick and dead
    Till of this flat a mountain you have made
    T' o'ertop ol
d Pelion or the skyish head
    Of blue Olympus.
  Ham. [comes forward] What is he whose grief
  
  Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow
    Conjures the wand'ring stars, and makes them s
tand
    Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,
    Hamlet the Dane.                    [Leaps in
 after Laertes.
  Laer. The devil take thy soul!
                                            [Grap
ples with him].
  Ham. Thou pray'st not well.
    I prithee take thy fingers from my throat;
    
For, though I am not splenitive and rash,
    Yet have I in me something dangerous,
    Which let 
thy wisdom fear. Hold off thy hand!
  King. Pluck them asunder.
  Queen. Hamlet, Hamlet!
  All. G
entlemen!
  Hor. Good my lord, be quiet.
             [The Attendants part them, and they come out
 of the
                                                         grave.]
  Ham. Why, I will fight 
with him upon this theme
    Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
  Queen. O my son, what theme?

  Ham. I lov'd Ophelia. Forty thousand brothers
    Could not (with all their quantity of love)
  
  Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?
  King. O, he is mad, Laertes.
  Queen. For love of G
od, forbear him!
  Ham. 'Swounds, show me what thou't do.
    Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast?
 woo't tear thyself?
    Woo't drink up esill? eat a crocodile?
    I'll do't. Dost thou come here
 to whine?
    To outface me with leaping in her grave?
    Be buried quick with her, and so will 
I.
    And if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
    Millions of acres on us, till our ground

    Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth
,
    I'll rant as well as thou.
  Queen. This is mere madness;
    And thus a while the fit will
 work on him.
    Anon, as patient as the female dove
    When that her golden couplets are disclo
s'd,
    His silence will sit drooping.
  Ham. Hear you, sir!
    What is the reason that you use
 me thus?
    I lov'd you ever. But it is no matter.
    Let Hercules himself do what he may,
   
 The cat will mew, and dog will have his day.
Exit.
  King. I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon h
im.
                                                   Exit Horatio.
    [To Laertes] Strengthen y
our patience in our last night's
speech.
    We'll put the matter to the present push.-
    Good 
Gertrude, set some watch over your son.-
    This grave shall have a living monument.
    An hour 
of quiet shortly shall we see;
    Till then in patience our proceeding be.
                      
                                   Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A hall in the Castle.

En
ter Hamlet and Horatio.

  Ham. So much for this, sir; now shall you see the other.
    You do re
member all the circumstance?
  Hor. Remember it, my lord!
  Ham. Sir, in my heart there was a kind
 of fighting
    That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay
    Worse than the mutinies in the b
ilboes. Rashly-
    And prais'd be rashness for it; let us know,
    Our indiscretion sometime ser
ves us well
    When our deep plots do pall; and that should learn us
    There's a divinity that 
shapes our ends,
    Rough-hew them how we will-
  Hor. That is most certain.
  Ham. Up from my c
abin,
    My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
    Grop'd I to find out them; had my desire,

    Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew
    To mine own room again; making so bold
    (M
y fears forgetting manners) to unseal
    Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio
    (O ro
yal knavery!), an exact command,
    Larded with many several sorts of reasons,
    Importing Denm
ark's health, and England's too,
    With, hoo! such bugs and goblins in my life-
    That, on the
 supervise, no leisure bated,
    No, not to stay the finding of the axe,
    My head should be st
ruck off.
  Hor. Is't possible?
  Ham. Here's the commission; read it at more leisure.
    But wi
lt thou bear me how I did proceed?
  Hor. I beseech you.
  Ham. Being thus benetted round with vil
lanies,
    Or I could make a prologue to my brains,
    They had begun the play. I sat me down;

    Devis'd a new commission; wrote it fair.
    I once did hold it, as our statists do,
    A bas
eness to write fair, and labour'd much
    How to forget that learning; but, sir, now
    It did m
e yeoman's service. Wilt thou know
    Th' effect of what I wrote?
  Hor. Ay, good my lord.
  Ham
. An earnest conjuration from the King,
    As England was his faithful tributary,
    As love bet
ween them like the palm might flourish,
    As peace should still her wheaten garland wear
    And
 stand a comma 'tween their amities,
    And many such-like as's of great charge,
    That, on the
 view and knowing of these contents,
    Without debatement further, more or less,
    He should t
he bearers put to sudden death,
    Not shriving time allow'd.
  Hor. How was this seal'd?
  Ham.
 Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
    I had my father's signet in my purse,
    Which was th
e model of that Danish seal;
    Folded the writ up in the form of th' other,
    Subscrib'd it, g
ave't th' impression, plac'd it safely,
    The changeling never known. Now, the next day
    Was 
our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent
    Thou know'st already.
  Hor. So Guildenstern and R
osencrantz go to't.
  Ham. Why, man, they did make love to this employment!
    They are not near 
my conscience; their defeat
    Does by their own insinuation grow.
    'Tis dangerous when the ba
ser nature comes
    Between the pass and fell incensed points
    Of mighty opposites.
  Hor. Wh
y, what a king is this!
  Ham. Does it not, thinks't thee, stand me now upon-
    He that hath kil
l'd my king, and whor'd my mother;
    Popp'd in between th' election and my hopes;
    Thrown out
 his angle for my proper life,
    And with such coz'nage- is't not perfect conscience
    To quit
 him with this arm? And is't not to be damn'd
    To let this canker of our nature come
    In fur
ther evil?
  Hor. It must be shortly known to him from England
    What is the issue of the busine
ss there.
  Ham. It will be short; the interim is mine,
    And a man's life is no more than to sa
y 'one.'
    But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
    That to Laertes I forgot myself,
    For by t
he image of my cause I see
    The portraiture of his. I'll court his favours.
    But sure the br
avery of his grief did put me
    Into a tow'ring passion.
  Hor. Peace! Who comes here?

      
           Enter young Osric, a courtier.

  Osr. Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.

  Ham. I humbly thank you, sir. [Aside to Horatio] Dost know this
    waterfly?
  Hor. [aside to 
Hamlet] No, my good lord.
  Ham. [aside to Horatio] Thy state is the more gracious; for
'tis a
  
  vice to know him. He hath much land, and fertile. Let a beast
be
    lord of beasts, and his cri
b shall stand at the king's mess.
'Tis
    a chough; but, as I say, spacious in the possession of 
dirt.

  Osr. Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should
impart
    a thing to you f
rom his Majesty.
  Ham. I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit. Put
your
    bonnet
 to his right use. 'Tis for the head.
  Osr. I thank your lordship, it is very hot.
  Ham. No, bel
ieve me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly.
  Osr. It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
  
Ham. But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my
complexion.
  Osr. Exceedingly, my lord; it
 is very sultry, as 'twere- I
cannot
    tell how. But, my lord, his Majesty bade me signify to yo
u
that
    he has laid a great wager on your head. Sir, this is the
matter-
  Ham. I beseech you
 remember.
                           [Hamlet moves him to put on his hat.]
  Osr. Nay, good my lo
rd; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here
is
    newly come to court Laertes; believe me, an abs
olute
gentleman,
    full of most excellent differences, of very soft society and
    great showi
ng. Indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the
card
    or calendar of gentry; for you shall fin
d in him the
continent of
    what part a gentleman would see.
  Ham. Sir, his definement suffers
 no perdition in you; though, I

    know, to divide him inventorially would dozy th' arithmetic

of
    memory, and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail.
    But, in the verity of ext
olment, I take him to be a soul of
great
    article, and his infusion of such dearth and rareness
 as, to
make
    true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror, and who
else
    would trace 
him, his umbrage, nothing more.
  Osr. Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
  Ham. The con
cernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our
more
    rawer breath?
  Osr. Sir?
  Hor [asi
de to Hamlet] Is't not possible to understand in
another
    tongue? You will do't, sir, really.

  Ham. What imports the nomination of this gentleman?
  Osr. Of Laertes?
  Hor. [aside] His purse 
is empty already. All's golden words are
    spent.
  Ham. Of him, sir.
  Osr. I know you are not
 ignorant-
  Ham. I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would
not
    much approve 
me. Well, sir?
  Osr. You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is-
  Ham. I dare not confes
s that, lest I should compare with him in
    excellence; but to know a man well were to know himse
lf.
  Osr. I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on
him
    by them, in his mee
d he's unfellowed.
  Ham. What's his weapon?
  Osr. Rapier and dagger.
  Ham. That's two of his w
eapons- but well.
  Osr. The King, sir, hath wager'd with him six Barbary horses;
    against the 
which he has impon'd, as I take it, six French
    rapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as gir
dle, hangers,
and
    so. Three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy,
    very resp
onsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of
    very liberal conceit.
  Ham. What call yo
u the carriages?
  Hor. [aside to Hamlet] I knew you must be edified by the
margent
    ere you h
ad done.
  Osr. The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
  Ham. The phrase would be more germane to th
e matter if we could
    carry cannon by our sides. I would it might be hangers till
then.
    Bu
t on! Six Barbary horses against six French swords, their
    assigns, and three liberal-conceited 
carriages: that's the
French
    bet against the Danish. Why is this all impon'd, as you call
it?

  Osr. The King, sir, hath laid that, in a dozen passes between
    yourself and him, he shall no
t exceed you three hits; he hath
    laid on twelve for nine, and it would come to immediate trial

    if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.
  Ham. How if I answer no?
  Osr. I mean, my lor
d, the opposition of your person in trial.
  Ham. Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please h
is
Majesty,
    it is the breathing time of day with me. Let the foils be
    brought, the gentle
man willing, and the King hold his
purpose,
    I will win for him if I can; if not, I will gain n
othing but
my
    shame and the odd hits.
  Osr. Shall I redeliver you e'en so?
  Ham. To this e
ffect, sir, after what flourish your nature will.
  Osr. I commend my duty to your lordship.
  Ham
. Yours, yours. [Exit Osric.] He does well to commend it
    himself; there are no tongues else for
's turn.
  Hor. This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.
  Ham. He did comply with his d
ug before he suck'd it. Thus has
he,
    and many more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age

dotes
    on, only got the tune of the time and outward habit of
encounter-
    a kind of yesty
 collection, which carries them through and
    through the most fann'd and winnowed opinions; and 
do but
blow
    them to their trial-the bubbles are out,

                            Enter a Lo
rd.

  Lord. My lord, his Majesty commended him to you by young Osric,
who
    brings back to hi
m, that you attend him in the hall. He sends
to
    know if your pleasure hold to play with Laerte
s, or that you
will
    take longer time.
  Ham. I am constant to my purposes; they follow the Ki
ng's
pleasure.
    If his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or whensoever,
provided
    I be so
 able as now.
  Lord. The King and Queen and all are coming down.
  Ham. In happy time.
  Lord. T
he Queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to
    Laertes before you fall to play.
  Ha
m. She well instructs me.
                                                    [Exit Lord.]
  Hor. 
You will lose this wager, my lord.
  Ham. I do not think so. Since he went into France I have been

in
    continual practice. I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst
not
    think how ill all's
 here about my heart. But it is no matter.
  Hor. Nay, good my lord -
  Ham. It is but foolery; bu
t it is such a kind of gaingiving as
    would perhaps trouble a woman.
  Hor. If your mind dislik
e anything, obey it. I will forestall
their
    repair hither and say you are not fit.
  Ham. Not
 a whit, we defy augury; there's a special providence
in
    the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 
'tis not to come; if it
be
    not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will
come:

    the readiness is all. Since no man knows aught of what he
leaves,
    what is't to leave betim
es? Let be.

    Enter King, Queen, Laertes, Osric, and Lords, with other
              Attendant
s with foils and gauntlets.
               A table and flagons of wine on it.

  King. Come, Haml
et, come, and take this hand from me.
                    [The King puts Laertes' hand into Hamlet'
s.]
  Ham. Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong;
    But pardon't, as you are a gentlem
an.
    This presence knows,
    And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd
    With sore d
istraction. What I have done
    That might your nature, honour, and exception
    Roughly awake, 
I here proclaim was madness.
    Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet.
    If Hamlet from hi
mself be taken away,
    And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
    Then Hamlet does it not
, Hamlet denies it.
    Who does it, then? His madness. If't be so,
    Hamlet is of the faction t
hat is wrong'd;
    His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
    Sir, in this audience,
    Let my dis
claiming from a purpos'd evil
    Free me so far in your most generous thoughts
    That I have sh
ot my arrow o'er the house
    And hurt my brother.
  Laer. I am satisfied in nature,
    Whose m
otive in this case should stir me most
    To my revenge. But in my terms of honour
    I stand al
oof, and will no reconcilement
    Till by some elder masters of known honour
    I have a voice a
nd precedent of peace
    To keep my name ungor'd. But till that time
    I do receive your offer'
d love like love,
    And will not wrong it.
  Ham. I embrace it freely,
    And will this brothe
r's wager frankly play.
    Give us the foils. Come on.
  Laer. Come, one for me.
  Ham. I'll be 
your foil, Laertes. In mine ignorance
    Your skill shall, like a star i' th' darkest night,
    
Stick fiery off indeed.
  Laer. You mock me, sir.
  Ham. No, by this hand.
  King. Give them the 
foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
    You know the wager?
  Ham. Very well, my lord.
    Your Gr
ace has laid the odds o' th' weaker side.
  King. I do not fear it, I have seen you both;
    But 
since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.
  Laer. This is too heavy; let me see another.
  Ham
. This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
                                              
  Prepare to play.
  Osr. Ay, my good lord.
  King. Set me the stoups of wine upon that table.
  
  If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
    Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
    Let all
 the battlements their ordnance fire;
    The King shall drink to Hamlet's better breath,
    And 
in the cup an union shall he throw
    Richer than that which four successive kings
    In Denmark
's crown have worn. Give me the cups;
    And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
    The trumpet
 to the cannoneer without,
    The cannons to the heavens, the heaven to earth,
    'Now the King 
drinks to Hamlet.' Come, begin.
    And you the judges, bear a wary eye.
  Ham. Come on, sir.
  L
aer. Come, my lord.                                They play.
  Ham. One.
  Laer. No.
  Ham. Judg
ment!
  Osr. A hit, a very palpable hit.
  Laer. Well, again!
  King. Stay, give me drink. Hamlet
, this pearl is thine;
    Here's to thy health.
               [Drum; trumpets sound; a piece goe
s off [within].
    Give him the cup.
  Ham. I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile.
    Com
e. (They play.) Another hit. What say you?
  Laer. A touch, a touch; I do confess't.
  King. Our s
on shall win.
  Queen. He's fat, and scant of breath.
    Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy br
ows.
    The Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
  Ham. Good madam!
  King. Gertrude, do not d
rink.
  Queen. I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.          Drinks.
  King. [aside] It is the p
oison'd cup; it is too late.
  Ham. I dare not drink yet, madam; by-and-by.
  Queen. Come, let me 
wipe thy face.
  Laer. My lord, I'll hit him now.
  King. I do not think't.
  Laer. [aside] And y
et it is almost against my conscience.
  Ham. Come for the third, Laertes! You but dally.
    Pray
 you pass with your best violence;
    I am afeard you make a wanton of me.
  Laer. Say you so? Co
me on.                               Play.
  Osr. Nothing neither way.
  Laer. Have at you now!
 
               [Laertes wounds Hamlet; then] in scuffling, they
                    change rapiers,
 [and Hamlet wounds Laertes].
  King. Part them! They are incens'd.
  Ham. Nay come! again!       
                  The Queen falls.

  Osr. Look to the Queen there, ho!
  Hor. They bleed on both
 sides. How is it, my lord?
  Osr. How is't, Laertes?
  Laer. Why, as a woodcock to mine own sprin
ge, Osric.
    I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.
  Ham. How does the Queen?
  King. She
 sounds to see them bleed.
  Queen. No, no! the drink, the drink! O my dear Hamlet!
    The drink,
 the drink! I am poison'd.                 [Dies.]
  Ham. O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd.
 
   Treachery! Seek it out.
                                                [Laertes falls.]
  Laer
. It is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain;
    No medicine in the world can do thee good.
    I
n thee there is not half an hour of life.
    The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
    Unbat
ed and envenom'd. The foul practice
    Hath turn'd itself on me. Lo, here I lie,
    Never to ris
e again. Thy mother's poison'd.
    I can no more. The King, the King's to blame.
  Ham. The point
 envenom'd too?
    Then, venom, to thy work.                    Hurts the King.
  All. Treason! t
reason!
  King. O, yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt.
  Ham. Here, thou incestuous, murd'rous,
 damned Dane,
    Drink off this potion! Is thy union here?
    Follow my mother.                 
                King dies.
  Laer. He is justly serv'd.
    It is a poison temper'd by himself.
 
   Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet.
    Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,

    Nor thine on me!                                       Dies.
  Ham. Heaven make thee free of it
! I follow thee.
    I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!
    You that look pale and tremble
 at this chance,
    That are but mutes or audience to this act,
    Had I but time (as this fell 
sergeant, Death,
    Is strict in his arrest) O, I could tell you-
    But let it be. Horatio, I a
m dead;
    Thou liv'st; report me and my cause aright
    To the unsatisfied.
  Hor. Never belie
ve it.
    I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.
    Here's yet some liquor left.
  Ham. As th'
art a man,
    Give me the cup. Let go! By heaven, I'll ha't.
    O good Horatio, what a wounded n
ame
    (Things standing thus unknown) shall live behind me!
    If thou didst ever hold me in thy
 heart,
    Absent thee from felicity awhile,
    And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,

    To tell my story.         [March afar off, and shot within.]
    What warlike noise is this?

  Osr. Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
    To the ambassadors of England gives

    This warlike volley.
  Ham. O, I die, Horatio!
    The potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit
.
    I cannot live to hear the news from England,
    But I do prophesy th' election lights
    
On Fortinbras. He has my dying voice.
    So tell him, with th' occurrents, more and less,
    Whi
ch have solicited- the rest is silence.             Dies.
  Hor. Now cracks a noble heart. Good nig
ht, sweet prince,
    And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
                               
                  [March within.]
    Why does the drum come hither?

    Enter Fortinbras and En
glish Ambassadors, with Drum,
                  Colours, and Attendants.

  Fort. Where is this s
ight?
  Hor. What is it you will see?
    If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
  Fort. T
his quarry cries on havoc. O proud Death,
    What feast is toward in thine eternal cell
    That 
thou so many princes at a shot
    So bloodily hast struck.
  Ambassador. The sight is dismal;
  
  And our affairs from England come too late.
    The ears are senseless that should give us hearin
g
    To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd
    That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.
  
  Where should we have our thanks?
  Hor. Not from his mouth,
    Had it th' ability of life to th
ank you.
    He never gave commandment for their death.
    But since, so jump upon this bloody qu
estion,
    You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
    Are here arriv'd, give order that 
these bodies
    High on a stage be placed to the view;
    And let me speak to the yet unknowing 
world
    How these things came about. So shall you hear
    Of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts;

    Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters;
    Of deaths put on by cunning and forc'd cause;

    And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
    Fall'n on th' inventors' heads. All this can I
   
 Truly deliver.
  Fort. Let us haste to hear it,
    And call the noblest to the audience.
    Fo
r me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.
    I have some rights of memory in this kingdom
    Which
 now, to claim my vantage doth invite me.
  Hor. Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
    And
 from his mouth whose voice will draw on more.
    But let this same be presently perform'd,
    E
ven while men's minds are wild, lest more mischance
    On plots and errors happen.
  Fort. Let fo
ur captains
    Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage;
    For he was likely, had he been put on
,
    To have prov'd most royally; and for his passage
    The soldiers' music and the rites of wa
r
    Speak loudly for him.
    Take up the bodies. Such a sight as this
    Becomes the field bu
t here shows much amiss.
    Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
            Exeunt marching; after the wh
ich a peal of ordnance
                                                   are shot off.

ACT I. Scene I.
Elsinore. A platform before the Castl
e.

Enter two Sentinels-[first,] Francisco, [who paces up and down
at his post; then] Bernardo, [
who approaches him].

  Ber. Who's there?
  Fran. Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.
  B
er. Long live the King!
  Fran. Bernardo?
  Ber. He.
  Fran. You come most carefully upon your ho
ur.
  Ber. 'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.
  Fran. For this relief much thanks
. 'Tis bitter cold,
    And I am sick at heart.
  Ber. Have you had quiet guard?
  Fran. Not a mo
use stirring.
  Ber. Well, good night.
    If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
    The rivals o
f my watch, bid them make haste.

                    Enter Horatio and Marcellus.

  Fran. I th
ink I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?
  Hor. Friends to this ground.
  Mar. And liegemen to th
e Dane.
  Fran. Give you good night.
  Mar. O, farewell, honest soldier.
    Who hath reliev'd yo
u?
  Fran. Bernardo hath my place.
    Give you good night.                                   Exit
.
  Mar. Holla, Bernardo!
  Ber. Say-
    What, is Horatio there ?
  Hor. A piece of him.
  Ber
. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.
  Mar. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?

  Ber. I have seen nothing.
  Mar. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
    And will not let belief 
take hold of him
    Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.
    Therefore I have entreated
 him along,
    With us to watch the minutes of this night,
    That, if again this apparition com
e,
    He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
  Hor. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
  Ber. Sit 
down awhile,
    And let us once again assail your ears,
    That are so fortified against our sto
ry,
    What we two nights have seen.
  Hor. Well, sit we down,
    And let us hear Bernardo spea
k of this.
  Ber. Last night of all,
    When yond same star that's westward from the pole
    Ha
d made his course t' illume that part of heaven
    Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
    
The bell then beating one-

                        Enter Ghost.

  Mar. Peace! break thee off! 
Look where it comes again!
  Ber. In the same figure, like the King that's dead.
  Mar. Thou art a
 scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
  Ber. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.
  Hor. Most l
ike. It harrows me with fear and wonder.
  Ber. It would be spoke to.
  Mar. Question it, Horatio.

  Hor. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night
    Together with that fair and warlike for
m
    In which the majesty of buried Denmark
    Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee spea
k!
  Mar. It is offended.
  Ber. See, it stalks away!
  Hor. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee sp
eak!
                                                     Exit Ghost.
  Mar. 'Tis gone and will no
t answer.
  Ber. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale.
    Is not this something more than 
fantasy?
    What think you on't?
  Hor. Before my God, I might not this believe
    Without the 
sensible and true avouch
    Of mine own eyes.
  Mar. Is it not like the King?
  Hor. As thou art
 to thyself.
    Such was the very armour he had on
    When he th' ambitious Norway combated.
  
  So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,
    He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
    'Ti
s strange.
  Mar. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
    With martial stalk hath he go
ne by our watch.
  Hor. In what particular thought to work I know not;
    But, in the gross and s
cope of my opinion,
    This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
  Mar. Good now, sit down, 
and tell me he that knows,
    Why this same strict and most observant watch
    So nightly toils 
the subject of the land,
    And why such daily cast of brazen cannon
    And foreign mart for imp
lements of war;
    Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
    Does not divide the Sunda
y from the week.
    What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
    Doth make the night joint-la
bourer with the day?
    Who is't that can inform me?
  Hor. That can I.
    At least, the whispe
r goes so. Our last king,
    Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
    Was, as you know, by Fo
rtinbras of Norway,
    Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
    Dar'd to the combat; in wh
ich our valiant Hamlet
    (For so this side of our known world esteem'd him)
    Did slay this Fo
rtinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,
    Well ratified by law and heraldry,
    Did forfeit, with h
is life, all those his lands
    Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror;
    Against the which
 a moiety competent
    Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
    To the inheritance of Fortin
bras,
    Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant
    And carriage of the article design'
d,
    His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
    Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
   
 Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,
    Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
    For
 food and diet, to some enterprise
    That hath a stomach in't; which is no other,
    As it doth
 well appear unto our state,
    But to recover of us, by strong hand
    And terms compulsatory, 
those foresaid lands
    So by his father lost; and this, I take it,
    Is the main motive of our
 preparations,
    The source of this our watch, and the chief head
    Of this post-haste and rom
age in the land.
  Ber. I think it be no other but e'en so.
    Well may it sort that this portent
ous figure
    Comes armed through our watch, so like the King
    That was and is the question of
 these wars.
  Hor. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
    In the most high and palmy state o
f Rome,
    A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
    The graves stood tenantless, and the sheet
ed dead
    Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;
    As stars with trains of fire, and dews
 of blood,
    Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
    Upon whose influence Neptune's empire 
stands
    Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.
    And even the like precurse of fierce even
ts,
    As harbingers preceding still the fates
    And prologue to the omen coming on,
    Have 
heaven and earth together demonstrated
    Unto our climature and countrymen.

                  
    Enter Ghost again.

    But soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again!
    I'll cross it, though
 it blast me.- Stay illusion!
                                               Spreads his arms.
   
 If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
    Speak to me.
    If there be any good thing to be do
ne,
    That may to thee do ease, and, race to me,
    Speak to me.
    If thou art privy to thy 
country's fate,
    Which happily foreknowing may avoid,
    O, speak!
    Or if thou hast uphoar
ded in thy life
    Extorted treasure in the womb of earth
    (For which, they say, you spirits o
ft walk in death),
                                                 The cock crows.
    Speak of i
t! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!
  Mar. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
  Hor. Do, 
if it will not stand.
  Ber. 'Tis here!
  Hor. 'Tis here!
  Mar. 'Tis gone!
                    
                                 Exit Ghost.
    We do it wrong, being so majestical,
    To offer
 it the show of violence;
    For it is as the air, invulnerable,
    And our vain blows malicious
 mockery.
  Ber. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
  Hor. And then it started, like a gui
lty thing
    Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
    The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,

    Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
    Awake the god of day; and at his warning,

    Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
    Th' extravagant and erring spirit hies
    To his
 confine; and of the truth herein
    This present object made probation.
  Mar. It faded on the c
rowing of the cock.
    Some say that ever, 'gainst that season comes
    Wherein our Saviour's bi
rth is celebrated,
    The bird of dawning singeth all night long;
    And then, they say, no spir
it dare stir abroad,
    The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,
    No fairy takes, nor
 witch hath power to charm,
    So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
  Hor. So have I heard an
d do in part believe it.
    But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
    Walks o'er the dew of 
yon high eastward hill.
    Break we our watch up; and by my advice
    Let us impart what we have
 seen to-night
    Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
    This spirit, dumb to us, will speak t
o him.
    Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
    As needful in our loves, fitting our 
duty?
    Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
    Where we shall find him most convenientl
y.           Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A room of state in the Castle.

Flourish. [Ente
r Claudius, King of Denmark, Gertrude the Queen,
Hamlet,
Polonius, Laertes and his sister Ophelia,
 [Voltemand, Cornelius,]
Lords Attendant.

  King. Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death

    The memory be green, and that it us befitted
    To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole ki
ngdom
    To be contracted in one brow of woe,
    Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature

    That we with wisest sorrow think on him
    Together with remembrance of ourselves.
    Theref
ore our sometime sister, now our queen,
    Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,
    Have
 we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,
    With an auspicious, and a dropping eye,
    With mirth in 
funeral, and with dirge in marriage,
    In equal scale weighing delight and dole,
    Taken to wi
fe; nor have we herein barr'd
    Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
    With this affair
 along. For all, our thanks.
    Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
    Holding a weak 
supposal of our worth,
    Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
    Our state to be disjoi
nt and out of frame,
    Colleagued with this dream of his advantage,
    He hath not fail'd to pe
ster us with message
    Importing the surrender of those lands
    Lost by his father, with all b
ands of law,
    To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
    Now for ourself and for this ti
me of meeting.
    Thus much the business is: we have here writ
    To Norway, uncle of young Fort
inbras,
    Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears
    Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress

    His further gait herein, in that the levies,
    The lists, and full proportions are all made

    Out of his subject; and we here dispatch
    You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,
    Fo
r bearers of this greeting to old Norway,
    Giving to you no further personal power
    To busin
ess with the King, more than the scope
    Of these dilated articles allow.            [Gives a pap
er.]
    Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
  Cor., Volt. In that, and all things, wi
ll we show our duty.
  King. We doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell.
                             
    Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius.
    And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
    You told u
s of some suit. What is't, Laertes?
    You cannot speak of reason to the Dane
    And lose your v
oice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
    That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
    The head
 is not more native to the heart,
    The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
    Than is the thr
one of Denmark to thy father.
    What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
  Laer. My dread lord,
    You
r leave and favour to return to France;
    From whence though willingly I came to Denmark
    To 
show my duty in your coronation,
    Yet now I must confess, that duty done,
    My thoughts and w
ishes bend again toward France
    And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
  King. Have yo
u your father's leave? What says Polonius?
  Pol. He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
  
  By laboursome petition, and at last
    Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent.
    I do beseech
 you give him leave to go.
  King. Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,
    And thy best gr
aces spend it at thy will!
    But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son-
  Ham. [aside] A little more
 than kin, and less than kind!
  King. How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
  Ham. Not so,
 my lord. I am too much i' th' sun.
  Queen. Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
    And let
 thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
    Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
    Seek for th
y noble father in the dust.
    Thou know'st 'tis common. All that lives must die,
    Passing thr
ough nature to eternity.
  Ham. Ay, madam, it is common.
  Queen. If it be,
    Why seems it so p
articular with thee?
  Ham. Seems, madam, Nay, it is. I know not 'seems.'
    'Tis not alone my in
ky cloak, good mother,
    Nor customary suits of solemn black,
    Nor windy suspiration of forc'
d breath,
    No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
    Nor the dejected havior of the visage,
 
   Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
    'That can denote me truly. These indeed see
m,
    For they are actions that a man might play;
    But I have that within which passeth show-

    These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
  King. 'Tis sweet and commendable in your natur
e, Hamlet,
    To give these mourning duties to your father;
    But you must know, your father lo
st a father;
    That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
    In filial obligation for s
ome term
    To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever
    In obstinate condolement is a course
  
  Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief;
    It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
    A
 heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
    An understanding simple and unschool'd;
    For what we 
know must be, and is as common
    As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
    Why should we in our
 peevish opposition
    Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
    A fault against the dea
d, a fault to nature,
    To reason most absurd, whose common theme
    Is death of fathers, and w
ho still hath cried,
    From the first corse till he that died to-day,
    'This must be so.' We 
pray you throw to earth
    This unprevailing woe, and think of us
    As of a father; for let the
 world take note
    You are the most immediate to our throne,
    And with no less nobility of lo
ve
    Than that which dearest father bears his son
    Do I impart toward you. For your intent
 
   In going back to school in Wittenberg,
    It is most retrograde to our desire;
    And we bese
ech you, bend you to remain
    Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
    Our chiefest courtie
r, cousin, and our son.
  Queen. Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.
    I pray thee stay
 with us, go not to Wittenberg.
  Ham. I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
  King. Why, 'tis a
 loving and a fair reply.
    Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come.
    This gentle and unforc'd 
accord of Hamlet
    Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,
    No jocund health that Denmark
 drinks to-day
    But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
    And the King's rouse the hea
ven shall bruit again,
    Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.
                                
Flourish. Exeunt all but Hamlet.
  Ham. O that this too too solid flesh would melt,
    Thaw, and 
resolve itself into a dew!
    Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
    His canon 'gainst self-sl
aughter! O God! God!
    How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
    Seem to me all the uses of t
his world!
    Fie on't! ah, fie! 'Tis an unweeded garden
    That grows to seed; things rank and 
gross in nature
    Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
    But two months dead! Nay, 
not so much, not two.
    So excellent a king, that was to this
    Hyperion to a satyr; so loving
 to my mother
    That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
    Visit her face too roughly. Hea
ven and earth!
    Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him
    As if increase of appetite had 
grown
    By what it fed on; and yet, within a month-
    Let me not think on't! Frailty, thy name
 is woman!-
    A little month, or ere those shoes were old
    With which she followed my poor fa
ther's body
    Like Niobe, all tears- why she, even she
    (O God! a beast that wants discourse 
of reason
    Would have mourn'd longer) married with my uncle;
    My father's brother, but no mo
re like my father
    Than I to Hercules. Within a month,
    Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous
 tears
    Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
    She married. O, most wicked speed, to pos
t
    With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
    It is not, nor it cannot come to good.
    Bu
t break my heart, for I must hold my tongue!

          Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo.


  Hor. Hail to your lordship!
  Ham. I am glad to see you well.
    Horatio!- or I do forget myse
lf.
  Hor. The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
  Ham. Sir, my good friend- I'll change 
that name with you.
    And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?
    Marcellus?
  Mar. My good
 lord!
  Ham. I am very glad to see you.- [To Bernardo] Good even, sir.-

    But what, in faith,
 make you from Wittenberg?
  Hor. A truant disposition, good my lord.
  Ham. I would not hear your
 enemy say so,
    Nor shall you do my ear that violence
    To make it truster of your own report

    Against yourself. I know you are no truant.
    But what is your affair in Elsinore?
    We'
ll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
  Hor. My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
  
Ham. I prithee do not mock me, fellow student.
    I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
  Ho
r. Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.
  Ham. Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats

    Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
    Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
  
  Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
    My father- methinks I see my father.
  Hor. O, where, 
my lord?
  Ham. In my mind's eye, Horatio.
  Hor. I saw him once. He was a goodly king.
  Ham. He
 was a man, take him for all in all.
    I shall not look upon his like again.
  Hor. My lord, I t
hink I saw him yesternight.
  Ham. Saw? who?
  Hor. My lord, the King your father.
  Ham. The Kin
g my father?
  Hor. Season your admiration for a while
    With an attent ear, till I may deliver

    Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
    This marvel to you.
  Ham. For God's love let me hea
r!
  Hor. Two nights together had these gentlemen
    (Marcellus and Bernardo) on their watch
   
 In the dead vast and middle of the night
    Been thus encount'red. A figure like your father,
  
  Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
    Appears before them and with solemn march
    Goes slow an
d stately by them. Thrice he walk'd
    By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
    Within his
 truncheon's length; whilst they distill'd
    Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
    Stand dum
b and speak not to him. This to me
    In dreadful secrecy impart they did,
    And I with them th
e third night kept the watch;
    Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
    Form of the thin
g, each word made true and good,
    The apparition comes. I knew your father.
    These hands are
 not more like.
  Ham. But where was this?
  Mar. My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
  
Ham. Did you not speak to it?
  Hor. My lord, I did;
    But answer made it none. Yet once methoug
ht
    It lifted up it head and did address
    Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
    But
 even then the morning cock crew loud,
    And at the sound it shrunk in haste away
    And vanish
'd from our sight.
  Ham. 'Tis very strange.
  Hor. As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
  
  And we did think it writ down in our duty
    To let you know of it.
  Ham. Indeed, indeed, sirs
. But this troubles me.
    Hold you the watch to-night?
  Both [Mar. and Ber.] We do, my lord.
 
 Ham. Arm'd, say you?
  Both. Arm'd, my lord.
  Ham. From top to toe?
  Both. My lord, from head 
to foot.
  Ham. Then saw you not his face?
  Hor. O, yes, my lord! He wore his beaver up.
  Ham. 
What, look'd he frowningly.
  Hor. A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
  Ham. Pale or red?

  Hor. Nay, very pale.
  Ham. And fix'd his eyes upon you?
  Hor. Most constantly.
  Ham. I wou
ld I had been there.
  Hor. It would have much amaz'd you.
  Ham. Very like, very like. Stay'd it 
long?
  Hor. While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
  Both. Longer, longer.
  Hor. N
ot when I saw't.
  Ham. His beard was grizzled- no?
  Hor. It was, as I have seen it in his life,

    A sable silver'd.
  Ham. I will watch to-night.
    Perchance 'twill walk again.
  Hor. I wa
rr'nt it will.
  Ham. If it assume my noble father's person,
    I'll speak to it, though hell its
elf should gape
    And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
    If you have hitherto conceal'd t
his sight,
    Let it be tenable in your silence still;
    And whatsoever else shall hap to-night
,
    Give it an understanding but no tongue.
    I will requite your loves. So, fare you well.
 
   Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
    I'll visit you.
  All. Our duty to your honour
.
  Ham. Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell.
                                        Exeunt [all
 but Hamlet].
    My father's spirit- in arms? All is not well.
    I doubt some foul play. Would 
the night were come!
    Till then sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,
    Though all the ea
rth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
Exit.




Scene III.
Elsinore. A room in the house of Polo
nius.

Enter Laertes and Ophelia.

  Laer. My necessaries are embark'd. Farewell.
    And, sist
er, as the winds give benefit
    And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
    But let me hear from 
you.
  Oph. Do you doubt that?
  Laer. For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,
    Hold it a 
fashion, and a toy in blood;
    A violet in the youth of primy nature,
    Forward, not permanent
- sweet, not lasting;
    The perfume and suppliance of a minute;
    No more.
  Oph. No more but
 so?
  Laer. Think it no more.
    For nature crescent does not grow alone
    In thews and bulk;
 but as this temple waxes,
    The inward service of the mind and soul
    Grows wide withal. Perh
aps he loves you now,
    And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
    The virtue of his will; but
 you must fear,
    His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
    For he himself is subject 
to his birth.
    He may not, as unvalued persons do,
    Carve for himself, for on his choice dep
ends
    The safety and health of this whole state,
    And therefore must his choice be circumscr
ib'd
    Unto the voice and yielding of that body
    Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he l
oves you,
    It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
    As he in his particular act and place

    May give his saying deed; which is no further
    Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.

    Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain
    If with too credent ear you list his songs,
 
   Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
    To his unmast'red importunity.
    Fear it
, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
    And keep you in the rear of your affection,
    Out of the
 shot and danger of desire.
    The chariest maid is prodigal enough
    If she unmask her beauty 
to the moon.
    Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes.
    The canker galls the infants of 
the spring
    Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd,
    And in the morn and liquid dew of yo
uth
    Contagious blastments are most imminent.
    Be wary then; best safety lies in fear.
    
Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
  Oph. I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep

    As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
    Do not as some ungracious pastors do,
    S
how me the steep and thorny way to heaven,
    Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
    H
imself the primrose path of dalliance treads
    And recks not his own rede.
  Laer. O, fear me no
t!

                       Enter Polonius.

    I stay too long. But here my father comes.
    
A double blessing is a double grace;
    Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
  Pol. Yet here, Lae
rtes? Aboard, aboard, for shame!
    The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
    And you are s
tay'd for. There- my blessing with thee!
    And these few precepts in thy memory
    Look thou ch
aracter. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
    Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.
    Be thou fami
liar, but by no means vulgar:
    Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
    Grapple t
hem unto thy soul with hoops of steel;
    But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
    Of each
 new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware
    Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,
    Bear't tha
t th' opposed may beware of thee.
    Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice;
    Take each m
an's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
    Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
    But not exp
ress'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
    For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
    And they in Franc
e of the best rank and station
    Are most select and generous, chief in that.
    Neither a borr
ower nor a lender be;
    For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
    And borrowing dulls the e
dge of husbandry.
    This above all- to thine own self be true,
    And it must follow, as the ni
ght the day,
    Thou canst not then be false to any man.
    Farewell. My blessing season this in
 thee!
  Laer. Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
  Pol. The time invites you. Go, your serv
ants tend.
  Laer. Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well
    What I have said to you.
  Oph. 'Tis 
in my memory lock'd,
    And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
  Laer. Farewell.             
                             Exit.
  Pol. What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?
  Oph. So pleas
e you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
  Pol. Marry, well bethought!
    'Tis told me he hath 
very oft of late
    Given private time to you, and you yourself
    Have of your audience been mo
st free and bounteous.
    If it be so- as so 'tis put on me,
    And that in way of caution- I mu
st tell you
    You do not understand yourself so clearly
    As it behooves my daughter and your 
honour.
    What is between you? Give me up the truth.
  Oph. He hath, my lord, of late made many 
tenders
    Of his affection to me.
  Pol. Affection? Pooh! You speak like a green girl,
    Unsi
fted in such perilous circumstance.
    Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
  Oph. I do 
not know, my lord, what I should think,
  Pol. Marry, I will teach you! Think yourself a baby
    
That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
    Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more de
arly,
    Or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
    Running it thus) you'll tender me a fo
ol.
  Oph. My lord, he hath importun'd me with love
    In honourable fashion.
  Pol. Ay, fashion
 you may call it. Go to, go to!
  Oph. And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
    With
 almost all the holy vows of heaven.
  Pol. Ay, springes to catch woodcocks! I do know,
    When t
he blood burns, how prodigal the soul
    Lends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter,
    Givin
g more light than heat, extinct in both
    Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
    You must
 not take for fire. From this time
    Be something scanter of your maiden presence.
    Set your 
entreatments at a higher rate
    Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
    Believe so much i
n him, that he is young,
    And with a larger tether may he walk
    Than may be given you. In fe
w, Ophelia,
    Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
    Not of that dye which their inv
estments show,
    But mere implorators of unholy suits,
    Breathing like sanctified and pious b
awds,
    The better to beguile. This is for all:
    I would not, in plain terms, from this time 
forth
    Have you so slander any moment leisure
    As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet
.
    Look to't, I charge you. Come your ways.
  Oph. I shall obey, my lord.
                    
                                     Exeunt.




Scene IV.
Elsinore. The platform before the C
astle.

Enter Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus.

  Ham. The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.

  Hor. It is a nipping and an eager air.
  Ham. What hour now?
  Hor. I think it lacks of twelve.

  Mar. No, it is struck.
  Hor. Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws near the season
    Wherein
 the spirit held his wont to walk.
                   A flourish of trumpets, and two pieces go off
.
    What does this mean, my lord?
  Ham. The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
    K
eeps wassail, and the swagg'ring upspring reels,
    And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down
,
    The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out
    The triumph of his pledge.
  Hor. Is it a cust
om?
  Ham. Ay, marry, is't;
    But to my mind, though I am native here
    And to the manner bor
n, it is a custom
    More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
    This heavy-headed revel
 east and west
    Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations;
    They clip us drunkards and wi
th swinish phrase
    Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
    From our achievements, though per
form'd at height,
    The pith and marrow of our attribute.
    So oft it chances in particular me
n
    That, for some vicious mole of nature in them,
    As in their birth,- wherein they are not 
guilty,
    Since nature cannot choose his origin,-
    By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
   
 Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
    Or by some habit that too much o'erleavens
 
   The form of plausive manners, that these men
    Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
    
Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,
    Their virtues else- be they as pure as grace,
    As
 infinite as man may undergo-
    Shall in the general censure take corruption
    From that parti
cular fault. The dram of e'il
    Doth all the noble substance often dout To his own scandal.

  
                       Enter Ghost.

  Hor. Look, my lord, it comes!
  Ham. Angels and ministers 
of grace defend us!
    Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
    Bring with thee airs from
 heaven or blasts from hell,
    Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
    Thou com'st in such a qu
estionable shape
    That I will speak to thee. I'll call thee Hamlet,
    King, father, royal Dan
e. O, answer me?
    Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell
    Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed 
in death,
    Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre
    Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'
d,
    Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws
    To cast thee up again. What may this mean
    
That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,
    Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
    Ma
king night hideous, and we fools of nature
    So horridly to shake our disposition
    With thoug
hts beyond the reaches of our souls?
    Say, why is this? wherefore? What should we do?
         
                                  Ghost beckons Hamlet.
  Hor. It beckons you to go away with it,

    As if it some impartment did desire
    To you alone.
  Mar. Look with what courteous action

    It waves you to a more removed ground.
    But do not go with it!
  Hor. No, by no means!
  H
am. It will not speak. Then will I follow it.
  Hor. Do not, my lord!
  Ham. Why, what should be t
he fear?
    I do not set my life at a pin's fee;
    And for my soul, what can it do to that,
  
  Being a thing immortal as itself?
    It waves me forth again. I'll follow it.
  Hor. What if it
 tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
    Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
    That beetles 
o'er his base into the sea,
    And there assume some other, horrible form
    Which might deprive
 your sovereignty of reason
    And draw you into madness? Think of it.
    The very place puts to
ys of desperation,
    Without more motive, into every brain
    That looks so many fadoms to the 
sea
    And hears it roar beneath.
  Ham. It waves me still.
    Go on. I'll follow thee.
  Mar.
 You shall not go, my lord.
  Ham. Hold off your hands!
  Hor. Be rul'd. You shall not go.
  Ham.
 My fate cries out
    And makes each petty artire in this body
    As hardy as the Nemean lion's 
nerve.
                                                [Ghost beckons.]

    Still am I call'd. U
nhand me, gentlemen.
    By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!-
    I say, away!- Go o
n. I'll follow thee.
                                        Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet.
  Hor. He wa
xes desperate with imagination.
  Mar. Let's follow. 'Tis not fit thus to obey him.
  Hor. Have af
ter. To what issue will this come?
  Mar. Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
  Hor. Heav
en will direct it.
  Mar. Nay, let's follow him.
                                                 
        Exeunt.




Scene V.
Elsinore. The Castle. Another part of the fortifications.

Ente
r Ghost and Hamlet.

  Ham. Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak! I'll go no further.
  Ghost. Mark m
e.
  Ham. I will.
  Ghost. My hour is almost come,
    When I to sulph'rous and tormenting flames

    Must render up myself.
  Ham. Alas, poor ghost!
  Ghost. Pity me not, but lend thy serious h
earing
    To what I shall unfold.
  Ham. Speak. I am bound to hear.
  Ghost. So art thou to reve
nge, when thou shalt hear.
  Ham. What?
  Ghost. I am thy father's spirit,
    Doom'd for a certa
in term to walk the night,
    And for the day confin'd to fast in fires,
    Till the foul crimes
 done in my days of nature
    Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid
    To tell the sec
rets of my prison house,
    I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
    Would harrow up thy sou
l, freeze thy young blood,
    Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
    Thy kn
otted and combined locks to part,
    And each particular hair to stand on end
    Like quills upo
n the fretful porcupine.
    But this eternal blazon must not be
    To ears of flesh and blood. L
ist, list, O, list!
    If thou didst ever thy dear father love-
  Ham. O God!
  Ghost. Revenge h
is foul and most unnatural murther.
  Ham. Murther?
  Ghost. Murther most foul, as in the best it 
is;
    But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.
  Ham. Haste me to know't, that I, with wings 
as swift
    As meditation or the thoughts of love,
    May sweep to my revenge.
  Ghost. I find 
thee apt;
    And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
    That rots itself in ease on Lethe 
wharf,
    Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.
    'Tis given out that, sleeping in 
my orchard,
    A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark
    Is by a forged process of my d
eath
    Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth,
    The serpent that did sting thy father's li
fe
    Now wears his crown.
  Ham. O my prophetic soul!
    My uncle?
  Ghost. Ay, that incestuo
us, that adulterate beast,
    With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts-
    O wicked wit
 and gifts, that have the power
    So to seduce!- won to his shameful lust
    The will of my mos
t seeming-virtuous queen.
    O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there,
    From me, whose love was 
of that dignity
    That it went hand in hand even with the vow
    I made to her in marriage, and
 to decline
    Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
    To those of mine!
    But virtue,
 as it never will be mov'd,
    Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
    So lust, though
 to a radiant angel link'd,
    Will sate itself in a celestial bed
    And prey on garbage.
    
But soft! methinks I scent the morning air.
    Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
    M
y custom always of the afternoon,
    Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
    With juice of curse
d hebona in a vial,
    And in the porches of my ears did pour
    The leperous distilment; whose 
effect
    Holds such an enmity with blood of man
    That swift as quicksilver it courses through

    The natural gates and alleys of the body,
    And with a sudden vigour it doth posset
    An
d curd, like eager droppings into milk,
    The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine;
    And 
a most instant tetter bark'd about,
    Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust
    All my 
smooth body.
    Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
    Of life, of crown, of queen, at onc
e dispatch'd;
    Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
    Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd,

    No reckoning made, but sent to my account
    With all my imperfections on my head.
  Ham. O,
 horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
  Ghost. If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.
    Let 
not the royal bed of Denmark be
    A couch for luxury and damned incest.
    But, howsoever thou 
pursuest this act,
    Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
    Against thy mother aught.
 Leave her to heaven,
    And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge
    To prick and sting her. 
Fare thee well at once.
    The glowworm shows the matin to be near
    And gins to pale his uneff
ectual fire.
    Adieu, adieu, adieu! Remember me.                      Exit.

  Ham. O all you h
ost of heaven! O earth! What else?
    And shall I couple hell? Hold, hold, my heart!
    And you,
 my sinews, grow not instant old,
    But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?
    Ay, thou poor gho
st, while memory holds a seat
    In this distracted globe. Remember thee?
    Yea, from the table
 of my memory
    I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
    All saws of books, all forms, all p
ressures past
    That youth and observation copied there,
    And thy commandment all alone shall
 live
    Within the book and volume of my brain,
    Unmix'd with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!

    O most pernicious woman!
    O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
    My tables! Meet 
it is I set it down
    That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
    At least I am sure it
 may be so in Denmark.        [Writes.]
    So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word:
    It is 'A
dieu, adieu! Remember me.'
    I have sworn't.
  Hor. (within) My lord, my lord!

              
     Enter Horatio and Marcellus.

  Mar. Lord Hamlet!
  Hor. Heaven secure him!
  Ham. So be it
!
  Mar. Illo, ho, ho, my lord!
  Ham. Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.
  Mar. How is't, my 
noble lord?
  Hor. What news, my lord?
  Mar. O, wonderful!
  Hor. Good my lord, tell it.
  Ham.
 No, you will reveal it.
  Hor. Not I, my lord, by heaven!
  Mar. Nor I, my lord.
  Ham. How say 
you then? Would heart of man once think it?
    But you'll be secret?
  Both. Ay, by heaven, my lo
rd.
  Ham. There's neer a villain dwelling in all Denmark
    But he's an arrant knave.
  Hor. Th
ere needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
    To tell us this.
  Ham. Why, right! You are i
n the right!
    And so, without more circumstance at all,
    I hold it fit that we shake hands a
nd part;
    You, as your business and desires shall point you,
    For every man hath business an
d desire,
    Such as it is; and for my own poor part,
    Look you, I'll go pray.
  Hor. These a
re but wild and whirling words, my lord.
  Ham. I am sorry they offend you, heartily;
    Yes, fai
th, heartily.
  Hor. There's no offence, my lord.
  Ham. Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Hora
tio,
    And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
    It is an honest ghost, that let me t
ell you.
    For your desire to know what is between us,
    O'ermaster't as you may. And now, goo
d friends,
    As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,
    Give me one poor request.
  Hor. W
hat is't, my lord? We will.
  Ham. Never make known what you have seen to-night.
  Both. My lord, 
we will not.
  Ham. Nay, but swear't.
  Hor. In faith,
    My lord, not I.
  Mar. Nor I, my lord
- in faith.
  Ham. Upon my sword.
  Mar. We have sworn, my lord, already.
  Ham. Indeed, upon my 
sword, indeed.

                 Ghost cries under the stage.

  Ghost. Swear.
  Ham. Aha boy, 
say'st thou so? Art thou there, truepenny?
    Come on! You hear this fellow in the cellarage.
   
 Consent to swear.
  Hor. Propose the oath, my lord.
  Ham. Never to speak of this that you have s
een.
    Swear by my sword.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
  Ham. Hic et ubique? Then we'll shift our 
ground.
    Come hither, gentlemen,
    And lay your hands again upon my sword.
    Never to spea
k of this that you have heard:
    Swear by my sword.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear by his sword.
  Ha
m. Well said, old mole! Canst work i' th' earth so fast?
    A worthy pioner! Once more remove, goo
d friends."
  Hor. O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
  Ham. And therefore as a strang
er give it welcome.
    There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
    Than are dreamt of
 in your philosophy.
    But come!
    Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
    How strange
 or odd soe'er I bear myself
    (As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
    To put an antic di
sposition on),
    That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
    With arms encumb'red thus, 
or this head-shake,
    Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
    As 'Well, well, we know,' o
r 'We could, an if we would,'
    Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'
    O
r such ambiguous giving out, to note
    That you know aught of me- this is not to do,
    So grac

  Ham. Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! So, gentlemen,

Act II. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the h
ouse of Polonius.

Enter Polonius and Reynaldo.

  Pol. Give him this money and these notes, Rey
naldo.
  Rey. I will, my lord.
  Pol. You shall do marvell's wisely, good Reynaldo,
    Before Yo
u visit him, to make inquire
    Of his behaviour.
  Rey. My lord, I did intend it.
  Pol. Marry,
 well said, very well said. Look you, sir,
    Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
    An
d how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
    What company, at what expense; and finding
  
  By this encompassment and drift of question
    That they do know my son, come you more nearer
 
   Than your particular demands will touch it.
    Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of h
im;
    As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
    And in part him.' Do you mark this, Reyna
ldo?
  Rey. Ay, very well, my lord.
  Pol. 'And in part him, but,' you may say, 'not well.
    Bu
t if't be he I mean, he's very wild
    Addicted so and so'; and there put on him
    What forgeri
es you please; marry, none so rank
    As may dishonour him- take heed of that;
    But, sir, such
 wanton, wild, and usual slips
    As are companions noted and most known
    To youth and liberty
.
  Rey. As gaming, my lord.
  Pol. Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
    Drabbing
. You may go so far.
  Rey. My lord, that would dishonour him.
  Pol. Faith, no, as you may season
 it in the charge.
    You must not put another scandal on him,
    That he is open to incontinenc
y.
    That's not my meaning. But breathe his faults so quaintly
    That they may seem the taints
 of liberty,
    The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
    A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
 
   Of general assault.
  Rey. But, my good lord-
  Pol. Wherefore should you do this?
  Rey. Ay, 
my lord,
    I would know that.
  Pol. Marry, sir, here's my drift,
    And I believe it is a fet
ch of warrant.
    You laying these slight sullies on my son
    As 'twere a thing a little soil'd
 i' th' working,
    Mark you,
    Your party in converse, him you would sound,
    Having ever s
een in the prenominate crimes
    The youth you breathe of guilty, be assur'd
    He closes with y
ou in this consequence:
    'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman'-
    According to the p
hrase or the addition
    Of man and country-
  Rey. Very good, my lord.
  Pol. And then, sir, do
es 'a this- 'a does- What was I about to
say?
    By the mass, I was about to say something! Where
 did I leave?
  Rey. At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,' and
    gentleman.'
  Pol
. At 'closes in the consequence'- Ay, marry!
    He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman.
    I saw 
him yesterday, or t'other day,
    Or then, or then, with such or such; and, as you say,
    There
 was 'a gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
    There falling out at tennis'; or perchance,
    'I 
saw him enter such a house of sale,'
    Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
    See you now-
    
Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth;
    And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
    Wi
th windlasses and with assays of bias,
    By indirections find directions out.
    So, by my form
er lecture and advice,
    Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?
  Rey. My lord, I have.
 
 Pol. God b' wi' ye, fare ye well!
  Rey. Good my lord!                                    [Going.]

  Pol. Observe his inclination in yourself.
  Rey. I shall, my lord.
  Pol. And let him ply his 
music.
  Rey. Well, my lord.
  Pol. Farewell!
                                                  E
xit Reynaldo.

                       Enter Ophelia.

    How now, Ophelia? What's the matter?

  Oph. O my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
  Pol. With what, i' th' name of God?
  Oph.
 My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
    Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac'd,
    No hat
 upon his head, his stockings foul'd,
    Ungart'red, and down-gyved to his ankle;
    Pale as his
 shirt, his knees knocking each other,
    And with a look so piteous in purport
    As if he had 
been loosed out of hell
    To speak of horrors- he comes before me.
  Pol. Mad for thy love?
  O
ph. My lord, I do not know,
    But truly I do fear it.
  Pol. What said he?
  Oph. He took me by
 the wrist and held me hard;
    Then goes he to the length of all his arm,
    And, with his othe
r hand thus o'er his brow,
    He falls to such perusal of my face
    As he would draw it. Long s
tay'd he so.
    At last, a little shaking of mine arm,
    And thrice his head thus waving up and
 down,
    He rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound
    As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
  
  And end his being. That done, he lets me go,
    And with his head over his shoulder turn'd
    
He seem'd to find his way without his eyes,
    For out o' doors he went without their help
    An
d to the last bended their light on me.
  Pol. Come, go with me. I will go seek the King.
    This
 is the very ecstasy of love,
    Whose violent property fordoes itself
    And leads the will to 
desperate undertakings
    As oft as any passion under heaven
    That does afflict our natures. I
 am sorry.
    What, have you given him any hard words of late?
  Oph. No, my good lord; but, as y
ou did command,
    I did repel his letters and denied
    His access to me.
  Pol. That hath mad
e him mad.
    I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
    I had not quoted him. I fear'd he
 did but trifle
    And meant to wrack thee; but beshrew my jealousy!
    By heaven, it is as prop
er to our age
    To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
    As it is common for the younger sor
t
    To lack discretion. Come, go we to the King.
    This must be known; which, being kept close
, might move
    More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
    Come.
                          
                               Exeunt.

Scene II.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Flourish. [E
nter King and Queen, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern,
cum aliis.

  King. Welcome, dear Rosencrantz 
and Guildenstern.
    Moreover that we much did long to see you,
    The need we have to use you d
id provoke
    Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
    Of Hamlet's transformation. So I ca
ll it,
    Sith nor th' exterior nor the inward man
    Resembles that it was. What it should be,

    More than his father's death, that thus hath put him
    So much from th' understanding of him
self,
    I cannot dream of. I entreat you both
    That, being of so young days brought up with h
im,
    And since so neighbour'd to his youth and haviour,
    That you vouchsafe your rest here i
n our court
    Some little time; so by your companies
    To draw him on to pleasures, and to gat
her
    So much as from occasion you may glean,
    Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus

    That, open'd, lies within our remedy.
  Queen. Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,
  
  And sure I am two men there are not living
    To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
  
  To show us so much gentry and good will
    As to expend your time with us awhile
    For the su
pply and profit of our hope,
    Your visitation shall receive such thanks
    As fits a king's re
membrance.
  Ros. Both your Majesties
    Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
    Put y
our dread pleasures more into command
    Than to entreaty.
  Guil. But we both obey,
    And her
e give up ourselves, in the full bent,
    To lay our service freely at your feet,
    To be comma
nded.
  King. Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
  Queen. Thanks, Guildenstern and gentl
e Rosencrantz.
    And I beseech you instantly to visit
    My too much changed son.- Go, some of 
you,
    And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
  Guil. Heavens make our presence and our prac
tices
    Pleasant and helpful to him!
  Queen. Ay, amen!
                 Exeunt Rosencrantz and
 Guildenstern, [with some
                                                    Attendants].

     
                    Enter Polonius.

  Pol. Th' ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
    Are jo
yfully return'd.
  King. Thou still hast been the father of good news.
  Pol. Have I, my lord? Ass
ure you, my good liege,
    I hold my duty as I hold my soul,
    Both to my God and to my graciou
s king;
    And I do think- or else this brain of mine
    Hunts not the trail of policy so sure

    As it hath us'd to do- that I have found
    The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
  King. O, spe
ak of that! That do I long to hear.
  Pol. Give first admittance to th' ambassadors.
    My news s
hall be the fruit to that great feast.
  King. Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
      
                                          [Exit Polonius.]
    He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he ha
th found
    The head and source of all your son's distemper.
  Queen. I doubt it is no other but 
the main,
    His father's death and our o'erhasty marriage.
  King. Well, we shall sift him.

 
             Enter Polonius, Voltemand, and Cornelius.

    Welcome, my good friends.
    Say, Vo
ltemand, what from our brother Norway?
  Volt. Most fair return of greetings and desires.
    Upon
 our first, he sent out to suppress
    His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
    To be a pre
paration 'gainst the Polack,
    But better look'd into, he truly found
    It was against your Hi
ghness; whereat griev'd,
    That so his sickness, age, and impotence
    Was falsely borne in han
d, sends out arrests
    On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys,
    Receives rebuke from Norway
, and, in fine,
    Makes vow before his uncle never more
    To give th' assay of arms against yo
ur Majesty.
    Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
    Gives him three thousand crowns in annu
al fee
    And his commission to employ those soldiers,
    So levied as before, against the Polac
k;
    With an entreaty, herein further shown,
                                                [Gi
ves a paper.]
    That it might please you to give quiet pass
    Through your dominions for this 
enterprise,
    On such regards of safety and allowance
    As therein are set down.
  King. It l
ikes us well;
    And at our more consider'd time we'll read,
    Answer, and think upon this busi
ness.
    Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour.
    Go to your rest; at night we'll fea
st together.
    Most welcome home!                       Exeunt Ambassadors.
  Pol. This business
 is well ended.
    My liege, and madam, to expostulate
    What majesty should be, what duty is,

    Why day is day, night is night, and time is time.
    Were nothing but to waste night, day, an
d time.
    Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
    And tediousness the limbs and outward
 flourishes,
    I will be brief. Your noble son is mad.
    Mad call I it; for, to define true ma
dness,
    What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
    But let that go.
  Queen. More matter, w
ith less art.
  Pol. Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
    That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 
'tis pity;
    And pity 'tis 'tis true. A foolish figure!
    But farewell it, for I will use no a
rt.
    Mad let us grant him then. And now remains
    That we find out the cause of this effect-

    Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
    For this effect defective comes by cause.
    Th
us it remains, and the remainder thus.
    Perpend.
    I have a daughter (have while she is mine)
,
    Who in her duty and obedience, mark,
    Hath given me this. Now gather, and surmise.
     
                                        [Reads] the letter.
    'To the celestial, and my soul's id
ol, the most beautified
      Ophelia,'-

    That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' i
s a vile
      phrase.
    But you shall hear. Thus:
                                            
            [Reads.]
    'In her excellent white bosom, these, &c.'
  Queen. Came this from Hamlet
 to her?
  Pol. Good madam, stay awhile. I will be faithful.     [Reads.]


          'Doubt tho
u the stars are fire;
            Doubt that the sun doth move;
          Doubt truth to be a liar
;
            But never doubt I love.
      'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers; I have not
 art
to
    reckon my groans; but that I love thee best, O most best,
believe
    it. Adieu.
  
    'Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to
him,

HAMLET.'

    This, in obe
dience, hath my daughter shown me;
    And more above, hath his solicitings,
    As they fell out 
by time, by means, and place,
    All given to mine ear.
  King. But how hath she
    Receiv'd hi
s love?
  Pol. What do you think of me?
  King. As of a man faithful and honourable.
  Pol. I wou
ld fain prove so. But what might you think,
    When I had seen this hot love on the wing
    (As 
I perceiv'd it, I must tell you that,
    Before my daughter told me), what might you,
    Or my d
ear Majesty your queen here, think,
    If I had play'd the desk or table book,
    Or given my he
art a winking, mute and dumb,
    Or look'd upon this love with idle sight?
    What might you thi
nk? No, I went round to work
    And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
    'Lord Hamlet is a p
rince, out of thy star.
    This must not be.' And then I prescripts gave her,
    That she should
 lock herself from his resort,
    Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
    Which done, she too
k the fruits of my advice,
    And he, repulsed, a short tale to make,
    Fell into a sadness, th
en into a fast,
    Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
    Thence to a lightness, and, by 
this declension,
    Into the madness wherein now he raves,
    And all we mourn for.
  King. Do 
you think 'tis this?
  Queen. it may be, very like.
  Pol. Hath there been such a time- I would fa
in know that-
    That I have Positively said ''Tis so,'
    When it prov'd otherwise.?
  King. N
ot that I know.
  Pol. [points to his head and shoulder] Take this from this, if
this
      be ot
herwise.
    If circumstances lead me, I will find
    Where truth is hid, though it were hid inde
ed
    Within the centre.
  King. How may we try it further?
  Pol. You know sometimes he walks f
or hours together
    Here in the lobby.
  Queen. So he does indeed.
  Pol. At such a time I'll l
oose my daughter to him.
    Be you and I behind an arras then.
    Mark the encounter. If he love
 her not,
    And he not from his reason fall'n thereon
    Let me be no assistant for a state,
 
   But keep a farm and carters.
  King. We will try it.

                 Enter Hamlet, reading o
n a book.

  Queen. But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
  Pol. Away, I do beseech
 you, both away
    I'll board him presently. O, give me leave.
                       Exeunt King
 and Queen, [with Attendants].
    How does my good Lord Hamlet?
  Ham. Well, God-a-mercy.
  Pol.
 Do you know me, my lord?
  Ham. Excellent well. You are a fishmonger.
  Pol. Not I, my lord.
  H
am. Then I would you were so honest a man.
  Pol. Honest, my lord?
  Ham. Ay, sir. To be honest, a
s this world goes, is to be one
man
    pick'd out of ten thousand.
  Pol. That's very true, my l
ord.
  Ham. For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god
    kissing carrion- Have you 
a daughter?
  Pol. I have, my lord.
  Ham. Let her not walk i' th' sun. Conception is a blessing, 
but
not
    as your daughter may conceive. Friend, look to't.
  Pol. [aside] How say you by that?
 Still harping on my daughter.
Yet
    he knew me not at first. He said I was a fishmonger. He is

far
    gone, far gone! And truly in my youth I suff'red much
extremity
    for love- very near 
this. I'll speak to him again.- What do
you
    read, my lord?
  Ham. Words, words, words.
  Pol
. What is the matter, my lord?
  Ham. Between who?
  Pol. I mean, the matter that you read, my lor
d.
  Ham. Slanders, sir; for the satirical rogue says here that old
men
    have grey beards; tha
t their faces are wrinkled; their eyes
    purging thick amber and plum-tree gum; and that they hav
e a
    plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams. All
which,
    sir, though I most po
werfully and potently believe, yet I
hold it
    not honesty to have it thus set down; for you you
rself, sir,
    should be old as I am if, like a crab, you could go backward.

  Pol. [aside] Tho
ugh this be madness, yet there is a method
in't.-
   Will You walk out of the air, my lord?
  Ham
. Into my grave?
  Pol. Indeed, that is out o' th' air. [Aside] How pregnant
sometimes
    his re
plies are! a happiness that often madness hits on,
which
    reason and sanity could not so prospe
rously be delivered of.
I
    will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting
between

    him and my daughter.- My honourable lord, I will most humbly
take
    my leave of you.
  Ham.
 You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more
    willingly part withal- except my life,
 except my life, except
my
    life,

                    Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.


  Pol. Fare you well, my lord.
  Ham. These tedious old fools!
  Pol. You go to seek the Lord Ham
let. There he is.
  Ros. [to Polonius] God save you, sir!
                                        
        Exit [Polonius].

  Guil. My honour'd lord!
  Ros. My most dear lord!
  Ham. My excellen
t good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern?
Ah,
    Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
  Ro
s. As the indifferent children of the earth.
  Guil. Happy in that we are not over-happy.
    On F
ortune's cap we are not the very button.
  Ham. Nor the soles of her shoe?
  Ros. Neither, my lord
.
  Ham. Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her
    favours?
  Guil. Faith, her p
rivates we.
  Ham. In the secret parts of Fortune? O! most true! she is a
    strumpet. What news 
?
  Ros. None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
  Ham. Then is doomsday near! But your 
news is not true. Let me
    question more in particular. What have you, my good friends,
    dese
rved at the hands of Fortune that she sends you to prison
    hither?
  Guil. Prison, my lord?
  
Ham. Denmark's a prison.
  Ros. Then is the world one.
  Ham. A goodly one; in which there are man
y confines, wards, and
    dungeons, Denmark being one o' th' worst.
  Ros. We think not so, my lo
rd.
  Ham. Why, then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either
good
    or bad but thinking m
akes it so. To me it is a prison.
  Ros. Why, then your ambition makes it one. 'Tis too narrow for

your
    mind.
  Ham. O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a
    king of inf
inite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.
  Guil. Which dreams indeed are ambition; for the 
very substance
of
    the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
  Ham. A dream itself is but
 a shadow.
  Ros. Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality
that
    it is but a 
shadow's shadow.
  Ham. Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and
outstretch'd
    heroes
 the beggars' shadows. Shall we to th' court? for, by
my
    fay, I cannot reason.
  Both. We'll 
wait upon you.
  Ham. No such matter! I will not sort you with the rest of my
    servants; for, t
o speak to you like an honest man, I am most
    dreadfully attended. But in the beaten way of frie
ndship,
what
    make you at Elsinore?
  Ros. To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
  Ham. B
eggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank
you;
    and sure, dear friends, my thanks 
are too dear a halfpenny.
Were
    you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free
    v
isitation? Come, deal justly with me. Come, come! Nay,
speak.
  Guil. What should we say, my lord?

  Ham. Why, anything- but to th' purpose. You were sent for; and
    there is a kind of confessio
n in your looks, which your
modesties
    have not craft enough to colour. I know the good King an
d
Queen
    have sent for you.
  Ros. To what end, my lord?
  Ham. That you must teach me. But l
et me conjure you by the
rights
    of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the
   
 obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear
a
    better proposer could charge y
ou withal, be even and direct
with
    me, whether you were sent for or no.
  Ros. [aside to Guil
denstern] What say you?
  Ham. [aside] Nay then, I have an eye of you.- If you love me,
hold
    
not off.
  Guil. My lord, we were sent for.
  Ham. I will tell you why. So shall my anticipation p
revent your
    discovery, and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no
    feather. I have of 
late- but wherefore I know not- lost all
my
    mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed
, it goes
so
    heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the
earth,
    seems to me 
a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy,
the
    air, look you, this brave o'erhanging fi
rmament, this
majestical
    roof fretted with golden fire- why, it appeareth no other
thing
   
 to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What
a
    piece of work is a man! how n
oble in reason! how infinite in
    faculties! in form and moving how express and admirable! in
  
  action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the
    beauty of the world, the parago
n of animals! And yet to me
what
    is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me- no, nor
w
oman
    neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.
  Ros. My lord, there was no such stu
ff in my thoughts.
  Ham. Why did you laugh then, when I said 'Man delights not me'?
  Ros. To thi
nk, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten
    entertainment the players shall receive fro
m you. We coted
them
    on the way, and hither are they coming to offer you service.
  Ham. He t
hat plays the king shall be welcome- his Majesty shall
    have tribute of me; the adventurous knig
ht shall use his foil
and
    target; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humorous man
shall
  
  end his part in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose
    lungs are tickle o' th' sere; a
nd the lady shall say her mind
    freely, or the blank verse shall halt for't. What players are
 
   they?
  Ros. Even those you were wont to take such delight in, the
    tragedians of the city.

  Ham. How chances it they travel? Their residence, both in
    reputation and profit, was better 
both ways.
  Ros. I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late
    innovation.
  Ham. 
Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in
the
    city? Are they so follow'd?
  Ros
. No indeed are they not.
  Ham. How comes it? Do they grow rusty?
  Ros. Nay, their endeavour kee
ps in the wonted pace; but there
is,
    sir, an eyrie of children, little eyases, that cry out on
 the
top
    of question and are most tyrannically clapp'd for't. These
are now
    the fashion,
 and so berattle the common stages (so they call
    them) that many wearing rapiers are afraid of 
goosequills and
    dare scarce come thither.
  Ham. What, are they children? Who maintains 'em? H
ow are they
    escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can
    sing? Will they 
not say afterwards, if they should grow
    themselves to common players (as it is most like, if th
eir
means
    are no better), their writers do them wrong to make them
exclaim
    against their
 own succession.
  Ros. Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the
nation
    holds 
it no sin to tarre them to controversy. There was, for
a
    while, no money bid for argument unle
ss the poet and the
player
    went to cuffs in the question.
  Ham. Is't possible?
  Guil. O, t
here has been much throwing about of brains.
  Ham. Do the boys carry it away?
  Ros. Ay, that the
y do, my lord- Hercules and his load too.
  Ham. It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of De
nmark,
and
    those that would make mows at him while my father lived give
    twenty, forty, fi
fty, a hundred ducats apiece for his picture
in
    little. 'Sblood, there is something in this mo
re than
natural, if
    philosophy could find it out.

                     Flourish for the Pla
yers.

  Guil. There are the players.
  Ham. Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, 
come!
Th'
    appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me
comply
    with you in thi
s garb, lest my extent to the players (which I
    tell you must show fairly outwards) should more 
appear like
    entertainment than yours. You are welcome. But my
uncle-father
    and aunt-mothe
r are deceiv'd.
  Guil. In what, my dear lord?
  Ham. I am but mad north-north-west. When the wind
 is southerly
I
    know a hawk from a handsaw.

                            Enter Polonius.


  Pol. Well be with you, gentlemen!
  Ham. Hark you, Guildenstern- and you too- at each ear a heare
r!
    That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling
    clouts.
  Ros. Happily h
e's the second time come to them; for they say an
old
    man is twice a child.
  Ham. I will pro
phesy he comes to tell me of the players. Mark
it.-
   You say right, sir; a Monday morning; twas 
so indeed.
  Pol. My lord, I have news to tell you.
  Ham. My lord, I have news to tell you. When 
Roscius was an
actor in
    Rome-
  Pol. The actors are come hither, my lord.
  Ham. Buzz, buzz!

  Pol. Upon my honour-
  Ham. Then came each actor on his ass-
  Pol. The best actors in the wor
ld, either for tragedy, comedy,
    history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral,
    
tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral;
scene
    individable, or poem unlimite
d. Seneca cannot be too heavy,
nor
    Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, the
se
are
    the only men.
  Ham. O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
  Pol. 
What treasure had he, my lord?
  Ham. Why,

         'One fair daughter, and no more,
          
 The which he loved passing well.'

  Pol. [aside] Still on my daughter.
  Ham. Am I not i' th' r
ight, old Jephthah?
  Pol. If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I
    love pas
sing well.
  Ham. Nay, that follows not.
  Pol. What follows then, my lord?
  Ham. Why,

      
     'As by lot, God wot,'

 and then, you know,

           'It came to pass, as most like it w
as.'

    The first row of the pious chanson will show you more; for
look
    where my abridgmen
t comes.

                     Enter four or five Players.

    You are welcome, masters; welcom
e, all.- I am glad to see
thee
    well.- Welcome, good friends.- O, my old friend? Why, thy
face
 is
    valanc'd since I saw thee last. Com'st' thou to' beard me in
    Denmark?- What, my young 
lady and mistress? By'r Lady, your
    ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last by the

    altitude of a chopine. Pray God your voice, like a piece of
    uncurrent gold, be not crack'
d within the ring.- Masters, you
are
    all welcome. We'll e'en to't like French falconers, fly a
t
    anything we see. We'll have a speech straight. Come, give us
a
    taste of your quality. C
ome, a passionate speech.
  1. Play. What speech, my good lord?
  Ham. I heard thee speak me a spe
ech once, but it was never
acted;
    or if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember,
ple
as'd
    not the million, 'twas caviary to the general; but it was (as
I
    receiv'd it, and oth
ers, whose judgments in such matters
cried in
    the top of mine) an excellent play, well digeste
d in the
scenes,
    set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember one said
    there were
 no sallets in the lines to make the matter
savoury,
    nor no matter in the phrase that might in
dict the author of
    affectation; but call'd it an honest method, as wholesome as
    sweet, and
 by very much more handsome than fine. One speech
in't
    I chiefly lov'd. 'Twas AEneas' tale to 
Dido, and thereabout
of it
    especially where he speaks of Priam's slaughter. If it live
in
  
  your memory, begin at this line- let me see, let me see:

         'The rugged Pyrrhus, like th'
 Hyrcanian beast-'

    'Tis not so; it begins with Pyrrhus:

         'The rugged Pyrrhus, he w
hose sable arms,
         Black as his purpose, did the night resemble
         When he lay couche
d in the ominous horse,
         Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd
         With he
raldry more dismal. Head to foot
         Now is be total gules, horridly trick'd
         With bl
ood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
         Bak'd and impasted with the parching streets,
 
        That lend a tyrannous and a damned light
         To their lord's murther. Roasted in wrath
 and fire,
         And thus o'ersized with coagulate gore,
         With eyes like carbuncles, th
e hellish Pyrrhus
         Old grandsire Priam seeks.'

    So, proceed you.
  Pol. Fore God, my
 lord, well spoken, with good accent and good
     discretion.

  1. Play. 'Anon he finds him,
 
     Striking too short at Greeks. His antique sword,
      Rebellious to his arm, lies where it fa
lls,
      Repugnant to command. Unequal match'd,
      Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes w
ide;
      But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
      Th' unnerved father falls. Then sen
seless Ilium,
      Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
      Stoops to his base, and with
 a hideous crash
      Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear. For lo! his sword,
      Which was declining o
n the milky head
      Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' th' air to stick.
      So, as a painted tyran
t, Pyrrhus stood,
      And, like a neutral to his will and matter,
      Did nothing.
      But,
 as we often see, against some storm,
      A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
      
The bold winds speechless, and the orb below
      As hush as death- anon the dreadful thunder
   
   Doth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
      Aroused vengeance sets him new awork;
   
   And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
      On Mars's armour, forg'd for proof eterne,
      
With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
      Now falls on Priam.
      Out, out, thou stru
mpet Fortune! All you gods,
      In general synod take away her power;
      Break all the spokes
 and fellies from her wheel,
      And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
      As low a
s to the fiends!

  Pol. This is too long.
  Ham. It shall to the barber's, with your beard.- Pri
thee say
on.
    He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps. Say on;
come to
    Hecuba.


  1. Play. 'But who, O who, had seen the mobled queen-'

  Ham. 'The mobled queen'?
  Pol. That
's good! 'Mobled queen' is good.

  1. Play. 'Run barefoot up and down, threat'ning the flames
  
    With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head
      Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
 
     About her lank and all o'erteemed loins,
      A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up-
   
   Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd
      'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have
 pronounc'd.
      But if the gods themselves did see her then,
      When she saw Pyrrhus make ma
licious sport
      In Mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,
      The instant burst of clam
our that she made
      (Unless things mortal move them not at all)
      Would have made milch th
e burning eyes of heaven
      And passion in the gods.'

  Pol. Look, whe'r he has not turn'd hi
s colour, and has tears
in's
    eyes. Prithee no more!
  Ham. 'Tis well. I'll have thee speak ou
t the rest of this
soon.-
    Good my lord, will you see the players well bestow'd? Do you
    he
ar? Let them be well us'd; for they are the abstract and
brief
    chronicles of the time. After y
our death you were better have
a
    bad epitaph than their ill report while you live.
  Pol. My 
lord, I will use them according to their desert.
  Ham. God's bodykins, man, much better! Use every
 man after his
    desert, and who should scape whipping? Use them after your
own
    honour and 
dignity. The less they deserve, the more merit is
in
    your bounty. Take them in.
  Pol. Come, 
sirs.
  Ham. Follow him, friends. We'll hear a play to-morrow.
                 Exeunt Polonius an
d Players [except the First].
    Dost thou hear me, old friend? Can you play 'The Murther of
    
Gonzago'?
  1. Play. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need, study 
a
    speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which I would set down
and
    insert in't, could you
 not?
  1. Play. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Very well. Follow that lord- and look you mock him not.
    
                                        [Exit First Player.]
    My good friends, I'll leave you ti
ll night. You are welcome
to
    Elsinore.
  Ros. Good my lord!
  Ham. Ay, so, God b' wi' ye!
 
                           [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
    Now I am alone.
    O what a r
ogue and peasant slave am I!
    Is it not monstrous that this player here,
    But in a fiction, 
in a dream of passion,
    Could force his soul so to his own conceit
    That, from her working, 
all his visage wann'd,
    Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
    A broken voice, and his
 whole function suiting
    With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!
    For Hecuba!
    W
hat's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
    That he should weep for her? What would he do,
    Had h
e the motive and the cue for passion
    That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
    And 
cleave the general ear with horrid speech;
    Make mad the guilty and appal the free,
    Confoun
d the ignorant, and amaze indeed
    The very faculties of eyes and ears.
    Yet I,
    A dull a
nd muddy-mettled rascal, peak
    Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
    And can say noth
ing! No, not for a king,
    Upon whose property and most dear life
    A damn'd defeat was made. 
Am I a coward?
    Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
    Plucks off my beard and blows 
it in my face?
    Tweaks me by th' nose? gives me the lie i' th' throat
    As deep as to the lun
gs? Who does me this, ha?
    'Swounds, I should take it! for it cannot be
    But I am pigeon-liv
er'd and lack gall
    To make oppression bitter, or ere this
    I should have fatted all the reg
ion kites
    With this slave's offal. Bloody bawdy villain!
    Remorseless, treacherous, lechero
us, kindless villain!
    O, vengeance!
    Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
    That I
, the son of a dear father murther'd,
    Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
    Must (lik
e a whore) unpack my heart with words
    And fall a-cursing like a very drab,
    A scullion!
  
  Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! Hum, I have heard
    That guilty creatures, sitting at a play,

    Have by the very cunning of the scene
    Been struck so to the soul that presently
    They
 have proclaim'd their malefactions;
    For murther, though it have no tongue, will speak
    Wit
h most miraculous organ, I'll have these Players
    Play something like the murther of my father

    Before mine uncle. I'll observe his looks;
    I'll tent him to the quick. If he but blench,
 
   I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
    May be a devil; and the devil hath power
    
T' assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
    Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
    As he i
s very potent with such spirits,
    Abuses me to damn me. I'll have grounds
    More relative tha
n this. The play's the thing
    Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King.         Exit.

ACT III. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King, Queen, Polonius, O
phelia, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern,
and Lords.

  King. And can you by no drift of circumstance
 
   Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
    Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
    Wi
th turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
  Ros. He does confess he feels himself distracted,
    But fro
m what cause he will by no means speak.
  Guil. Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
    But 
with a crafty madness keeps aloof
    When we would bring him on to some confession
    Of his tru
e state.
  Queen. Did he receive you well?
  Ros. Most like a gentleman.
  Guil. But with much fo
rcing of his disposition.
  Ros. Niggard of question, but of our demands
    Most free in his repl
y.
  Queen. Did you assay him
    To any pastime?
  Ros. Madam, it so fell out that certain playe
rs
    We o'erraught on the way. Of these we told him,
    And there did seem in him a kind of joy

    To hear of it. They are here about the court,
    And, as I think, they have already order
 
   This night to play before him.
  Pol. 'Tis most true;
    And he beseech'd me to entreat your M
ajesties
    To hear and see the matter.
  King. With all my heart, and it doth much content me
 
   To hear him so inclin'd.
    Good gentlemen, give him a further edge
    And drive his purpose 
on to these delights.
  Ros. We shall, my lord.
                            Exeunt Rosencrantz and
 Guildenstern.
  King. Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
    For we have closely sent for Hamlet hithe
r,
    That he, as 'twere by accident, may here
    Affront Ophelia.
    Her father and myself (l
awful espials)
    Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing unseen,
    We may of their encounter fra
nkly judge
    And gather by him, as he is behav'd,
    If't be th' affliction of his love, or no,

    That thus he suffers for.
  Queen. I shall obey you;
    And for your part, Ophelia, I do wi
sh
    That your good beauties be the happy cause
    Of Hamlet's wildness. So shall I hope your v
irtues
    Will bring him to his wonted way again,
    To both your honours.
  Oph. Madam, I wish
 it may.
                                                   [Exit Queen.]
  Pol. Ophelia, walk you
 here.- Gracious, so please you,
    We will bestow ourselves.- [To Ophelia] Read on this book,
  
  That show of such an exercise may colour
    Your loneliness.- We are oft to blame in this,
    
'Tis too much prov'd, that with devotion's visage
    And pious action we do sugar o'er
    The De
vil himself.
  King. [aside] O, 'tis too true!
    How smart a lash that speech doth give my consc
ience!
    The harlot's cheek, beautied with plast'ring art,
    Is not more ugly to the thing tha
t helps it
    Than is my deed to my most painted word.
    O heavy burthen!
  Pol. I hear him co
ming. Let's withdraw, my lord.
                                      Exeunt King and Polonius].


                           Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. To be, or not to be- that is the question:
    W
hether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
    The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
    Or to
 take arms against a sea of troubles,
    And by opposing end them. To die- to sleep-
    No more;
 and by a sleep to say we end
    The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks
    That flesh is
 heir to. 'Tis a consummation
    Devoutly to be wish'd. To die- to sleep.
    To sleep- perchance
 to dream: ay, there's the rub!
    For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
    When we ha
ve shuffled off this mortal coil,
    Must give us pause. There's the respect
    That makes calam
ity of so long life.
    For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
    Th' oppressor's wron
g, the proud man's contumely,
    The pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay,
    The insolence o
f office, and the spurns
    That patient merit of th' unworthy takes,
    When he himself might h
is quietus make
    With a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear,
    To grunt and sweat under
 a weary life,
    But that the dread of something after death-
    The undiscover'd country, from
 whose bourn
    No traveller returns- puzzles the will,
    And makes us rather bear those ills w
e have
    Than fly to others that we know not of?
    Thus conscience does make cowards of us all
,
    And thus the native hue of resolution
    Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
 
   And enterprises of great pith and moment
    With this regard their currents turn awry
    And 
lose the name of action.- Soft you now!
    The fair Ophelia!- Nymph, in thy orisons
    Be all my
 sins rememb'red.
  Oph. Good my lord,
    How does your honour for this many a day?
  Ham. I hum
bly thank you; well, well, well.
  Oph. My lord, I have remembrances of yours
    That I have long
ed long to re-deliver.
    I pray you, now receive them.
  Ham. No, not I!
    I never gave you a
ught.
  Oph. My honour'd lord, you know right well you did,
    And with them words of so sweet br
eath compos'd
    As made the things more rich. Their perfume lost,
    Take these again; for to t
he noble mind
    Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
    There, my lord.
  Ham. Ha, ha
! Are you honest?
  Oph. My lord?
  Ham. Are you fair?
  Oph. What means your lordship?
  Ham. T
hat if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit
no
    discourse to your beauty.
  Oph. 
Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with
honesty?
  Ham. Ay, truly; for the power of 
beauty will sooner transform
    honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty
can

    translate beauty into his likeness. This was sometime a
paradox,
    but now the time gives it
 proof. I did love you once.
  Oph. Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
  Ham. You should not
 have believ'd me; for virtue cannot so
    inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it. I lo
ved
you
    not.
  Oph. I was the more deceived.
  Ham. Get thee to a nunnery! Why wouldst thou 
be a breeder of
    sinners? I am myself indifferent honest, but yet I could
accuse
    me of suc
h things that it were better my mother had not borne
me.
    I am very proud, revengeful, ambitiou
s; with more offences at
my
    beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give
   
 them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows
as I
    do, crawling between earth 
and heaven? We are arrant knaves
all;
    believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where's yo
ur
    father?
  Oph. At home, my lord.
  Ham. Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play t
he fool
    nowhere but in's own house. Farewell.
  Oph. O, help him, you sweet heavens!
  Ham. I
f thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy
dowry:
    be thou as chaste as ice, as pure
 as snow, thou shalt not
escape
    calumny. Get thee to a nunnery. Go, farewell. Or if thou wilt

    needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what
    monsters you make of them. T
o a nunnery, go; and quickly too.
    Farewell.
  Oph. O heavenly powers, restore him!
  Ham. I h
ave heard of your paintings too, well enough. God hath
    given you one face, and you make yoursel
ves another. You jig,
you
    amble, and you lisp; you nickname God's creatures and make
your
  
  wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't! it hath
made
    me mad. I say, we will hav
e no more marriages. Those that are
    married already- all but one- shall live; the rest shall ke
ep
as
    they are. To a nunnery, go.                            Exit.
  Oph. O, what a noble min
d is here o'erthrown!
    The courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword,
    Th' expect
ancy and rose of the fair state,
    The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
    Th' observ'd 
of all observers- quite, quite down!
    And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
    That suck'
d the honey of his music vows,
    Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
    Like sweet be
lls jangled, out of tune and harsh;
    That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
    Blasted
 with ecstasy. O, woe is me
    T' have seen what I have seen, see what I see!

                 
  Enter King and Polonius.

  King. Love? his affections do not that way tend;
    Nor what he sp
ake, though it lack'd form a little,
    Was not like madness. There's something in his soul
    O
'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
    And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
    Will be 
some danger; which for to prevent,
    I have in quick determination
    Thus set it down: he shal
l with speed to England
    For the demand of our neglected tribute.
    Haply the seas, and count
ries different,
    With variable objects, shall expel
    This something-settled matter in his he
art,
    Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
    From fashion of himself. What think yo
u on't?
  Pol. It shall do well. But yet do I believe
    The origin and commencement of his grief

    Sprung from neglected love.- How now, Ophelia?
    You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said
.
    We heard it all.- My lord, do as you please;
    But if you hold it fit, after the play
   
 Let his queen mother all alone entreat him
    To show his grief. Let her be round with him;
    
And I'll be plac'd so please you, in the ear
    Of all their conference. If she find him not,
   
 To England send him; or confine him where
    Your wisdom best shall think.
  King. It shall be s
o.
    Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.         Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. h
all in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet and three of the Players.

  Ham. Speak the speech, I pray you,
 as I pronounc'd it to you,
    trippingly on the tongue. But if you mouth it, as many of our
    
players do, I had as live the town crier spoke my lines. Nor
do
    not saw the air too much with 
your hand, thus, but use all
    gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and (as I may say)
    
whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and beget a
    temperance that may give it smoothness.
 O, it offends me to
the
    soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion
to
  
  tatters, to very rags, to split the cars of the groundlings,
who
    (for the most part) are cap
able of nothing but inexplicable
dumb
    shows and noise. I would have such a fellow whipp'd for

o'erdoing
    Termagant. It out-herods Herod. Pray you avoid it.
  Player. I warrant your honour.

  Ham. Be not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be
your
    tutor. Suit the action t
o the word, the word to the action;
with
    this special observance, that you o'erstep not the mo
desty of
    nature: for anything so overdone is from the purpose of
playing,
    whose end, both
 at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as
    'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show Virtue 
her own
feature,
    scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time
his
    form and
 pressure. Now this overdone, or come tardy off,
though
    it make the unskilful laugh, cannot bu
t make the judicious
    grieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance
    o'erweigh
 a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that
I
    have seen play, and heard others praise
, and that highly (not
to
    speak it profanely), that, neither having the accent of
    Christi
ans, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have
so
    strutted and bellowed that I have thou
ght some of Nature's
    journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they
imitated
    human
ity so abominably.
  Player. I hope we have reform'd that indifferently with us,
sir.
  Ham. O, r
eform it altogether! And let those that play your
clowns
    speak no more than is set down for th
em. For there be of them
    that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren
    spe
ctators to laugh too, though in the mean time some
necessary
    question of the play be then to b
e considered. That's
villanous
    and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it.
Go

    make you ready.
                                                 Exeunt Players.

         
   Enter Polonius, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.

    How now, my lord? Will the King hear this p
iece of work?
  Pol. And the Queen too, and that presently.
  Ham. Bid the players make haste, [Ex
it Polonius.] Will you two
    help to hasten them?
  Both. We will, my lord.                     
  Exeunt they two.
  Ham. What, ho, Horatio!

                      Enter Horatio.

  Hor. Here
, sweet lord, at your service.
  Ham. Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
    As e'er my conversa
tion cop'd withal.
  Hor. O, my dear lord!
  Ham. Nay, do not think I flatter;
    For what advan
cement may I hope from thee,
    That no revenue hast but thy good spirits
    To feed and clothe 
thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
    No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
    And c
rook the pregnant hinges of the knee
    Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
    Sinc
e my dear soul was mistress of her choice
    And could of men distinguish, her election
    Hath 
seal'd thee for herself. For thou hast been
    As one, in suff'ring all, that suffers nothing;
  
  A man that Fortune's buffets and rewards
    Hast ta'en with equal thanks; and blest are those
 
   Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled
    That they are not a pipe for Fortune's finge
r
    To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
    That is not passion's slave, and I will 
wear him
    In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
    As I do thee. Something too much of
 this I
    There is a play to-night before the King.
    One scene of it comes near the circumsta
nce,
    Which I have told thee, of my father's death.
    I prithee, when thou seest that act afo
ot,
    Even with the very comment of thy soul
    Observe my uncle. If his occulted guilt
    Do
 not itself unkennel in one speech,
    It is a damned ghost that we have seen,
    And my imagina
tions are as foul
    As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
    For I mine eyes will rivet to
 his face,
    And after we will both our judgments join
    In censure of his seeming.
  Hor. We
ll, my lord.
    If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
    And scape detecting, I wil
l pay the theft.

    Sound a flourish. [Enter Trumpets and Kettledrums. Danish
    march. [Enter
 King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz,
      Guildenstern, and other Lords attendant, with t
he Guard
                       carrying torches.

  Ham. They are coming to the play. I must be 
idle.
    Get you a place.
  King. How fares our cousin Hamlet?
  Ham. Excellent, i' faith; of th
e chameleon's dish. I eat the
air,
    promise-cramm'd. You cannot feed capons so.
  King. I have
 nothing with this answer, Hamlet. These words are
not
    mine.
  Ham. No, nor mine now. [To Pol
onius] My lord, you play'd once
    i' th' university, you say?
  Pol. That did I, my lord, and wa
s accounted a good actor.
  Ham. What did you enact?
  Pol. I did enact Julius Caesar; I was kill'
d i' th' Capitol;
Brutus
    kill'd me.
  Ham. It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a ca
lf
there. Be
    the players ready.
  Ros. Ay, my lord. They stay upon your patience.
  Queen. C
ome hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
  Ham. No, good mother. Here's metal more attractive.
  Pol
. [to the King] O, ho! do you mark that?
  Ham. Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
                   
               [Sits down at Ophelia's feet.]

  Oph. No, my lord.
  Ham. I mean, my head upon yo
ur lap?
  Oph. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Do you think I meant country matters?
  Oph. I think nothing, 
my lord.
  Ham. That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
  Oph. What is, my lord?
  Ham.
 Nothing.
  Oph. You are merry, my lord.
  Ham. Who, I?
  Oph. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. O God, your o
nly jig-maker! What should a man do but be
merry?
    For look you how cheerfully my mother looks,
 and my father
died
    within 's two hours.
  Oph. Nay 'tis twice two months, my lord.
  Ham. S
o long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I'll have
a
    suit of sables. O heavens! die two
 months ago, and not
forgotten
    yet? Then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his
li
fe
    half a year. But, by'r Lady, he must build churches then; or
else
    shall he suffer not 
thinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose

    epitaph is 'For O, for O, the hobby-horse is forgot!
'

               Hautboys play. The dumb show enters.

    Enter a King and a Queen very loving
ly; the Queen embracing
    him and he her. She kneels, and makes show of protestation
    unto hi
m. He takes her up, and declines his head upon her
    neck. He lays him down upon a bank of flower
s. She, seeing
    him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his
    crown, kisses
 it, pours poison in the sleeper's ears, and
    leaves him. The Queen returns, finds the King dead
, and makes
    passionate action. The Poisoner with some three or four
Mutes,
    comes in again
, seem to condole with her. The dead body is
    carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with gi
fts; she
    seems harsh and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts
    his love.
             
                                            Exeunt.

  Oph. What means this, my lord?
  Ham. Marr
y, this is miching malhecho; it means mischief.
  Oph. Belike this show imports the argument of the
 play.

                      Enter Prologue.

  Ham. We shall know by this fellow. The players 
cannot keep
counsel;
    they'll tell all.
  Oph. Will he tell us what this show meant?
  Ham. A
y, or any show that you'll show him. Be not you asham'd
to
    show, he'll not shame to tell you w
hat it means.
  Oph. You are naught, you are naught! I'll mark the play.

    Pro. For us, and fo
r our tragedy,
      Here stooping to your clemency,
      We beg your hearing patiently.         
            [Exit.]

  Ham. Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
  Oph. 'Tis brief, my lord
.
  Ham. As woman's love.

              Enter [two Players as] King and Queen.

    King. Full
 thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round
      Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
  
    And thirty dozen moons with borrowed sheen
      About the world have times twelve thirties bee
n,
      Since love our hearts, and Hymen did our hands,
      Unite comutual in most sacred bands
.
    Queen. So many journeys may the sun and moon
      Make us again count o'er ere love be done
!
      But woe is me! you are so sick of late,
      So far from cheer and from your former state
.
      That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
      Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing mus
t;
      For women's fear and love holds quantity,
      In neither aught, or in extremity.
     
 Now what my love is, proof hath made you know;
      And as my love is siz'd, my fear is so.
    
  Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
      Where little fears grow great, great lov
e grows there.
    King. Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;
      My operant powers 
their functions leave to do.
      And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
      Honour'd, 
belov'd, and haply one as kind
      For husband shalt thou-
    Queen. O, confound the rest!
   
   Such love must needs be treason in my breast.
      When second husband let me be accurst!
    
  None wed the second but who killed the first.

  Ham. [aside] Wormwood, wormwood!

    Queen. 
The instances that second marriage move
      Are base respects of thrift, but none of love.
     
 A second time I kill my husband dead
      When second husband kisses me in bed.
    King. I do b
elieve you think what now you speak;
      But what we do determine oft we break.
      Purpose is
 but the slave to memory,
      Of violent birth, but poor validity;
      Which now, like fruit u
nripe, sticks on the tree,
      But fall unshaken when they mellow be.
      Most necessary 'tis 
that we forget
      To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt.
      What to ourselves in passio
n we propose,
      The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
      The violence of either grief 
or joy
      Their own enactures with themselves destroy.
      Where joy most revels, grief doth 
most lament;
      Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
      This world is not for aye, 
nor 'tis not strange
      That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
      For 'tis a q
uestion left us yet to prove,
      Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
      The gre
at man down, you mark his favourite flies,
      The poor advanc'd makes friends of enemies;
     
 And hitherto doth love on fortune tend,
      For who not needs shall never lack a friend,
      
And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
      Directly seasons him his enemy.
      But, orderly
 to end where I begun,
      Our wills and fates do so contrary run
      That our devices still a
re overthrown;
      Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own.
      So think thou wilt n
o second husband wed;
      But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
    Queen. Nor earth
 to me give food, nor heaven light,
      Sport and repose lock from me day and night,
      To de
speration turn my trust and hope,
      An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope,
      Each opposi
te that blanks the face of joy
      Meet what I would have well, and it destroy,
      Both here 
and hence pursue me lasting strife,
      If, once a widow, ever I be wife!

  Ham. If she should
 break it now!

    King. 'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile.
      My spirits grow d
ull, and fain I would beguile
      The tedious day with sleep.
    Queen. Sleep rock thy brain,

                                                    [He] sleeps.
      And never come mischance bet
ween us twain!
Exit.

  Ham. Madam, how like you this play?
  Queen. The lady doth protest too m
uch, methinks.
  Ham. O, but she'll keep her word.
  King. Have you heard the argument? Is there n
o offence in't?
  Ham. No, no! They do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i'
th'
    world.
  
King. What do you call the play?
  Ham. 'The Mousetrap.' Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the

    image of a murther done in Vienna. Gonzago is the duke's
name;
    his wife, Baptista. You sha
ll see anon. 'Tis a knavish piece
of
    work; but what o' that? Your Majesty, and we that have fr
ee
    souls, it touches us not. Let the gall'd jade winch; our
withers
    are unwrung.

     
                    Enter Lucianus.

    This is one Lucianus, nephew to the King.
  Oph. You are
 as good as a chorus, my lord.
  Ham. I could interpret between you and your love, if I could
see

    the puppets dallying.
  Oph. You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
  Ham. It would cost you a 
groaning to take off my edge.
  Oph. Still better, and worse.
  Ham. So you must take your husband
s.- Begin, murtherer. Pox,
leave
    thy damnable faces, and begin! Come, the croaking raven doth

    bellow for revenge.

    Luc. Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
     
 Confederate season, else no creature seeing;
      Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,

      With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,
      Thy natural magic and dire propert
y
      On wholesome life usurp immediately.
                                   Pours the poison i
n his ears.

  Ham. He poisons him i' th' garden for's estate. His name's
Gonzago.
    The story
 is extant, and written in very choice Italian. You
    shall see anon how the murtherer gets the l
ove of Gonzago's
wife.
  Oph. The King rises.
  Ham. What, frighted with false fire?
  Queen. Ho
w fares my lord?
  Pol. Give o'er the play.
  King. Give me some light! Away!
  All. Lights, ligh
ts, lights!
                              Exeunt all but Hamlet and Horatio.
  Ham.   Why, let the
 strucken deer go weep,
          The hart ungalled play;
         For some must watch, while some
 must sleep:
          Thus runs the world away.
    Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers
- if the rest of
my
    fortunes turn Turk with me-with two Provincial roses on my
raz'd
    sho
es, get me a fellowship in a cry of players, sir?
  Hor. Half a share.
  Ham.   A whole one I!
  
       For thou dost know, O Damon dear,
           This realm dismantled was
         Of Jove him
self; and now reigns here
           A very, very- pajock.
  Hor. You might have rhym'd.
  Ham. O
 good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand
    pound! Didst perceive?
  Hor. Very we
ll, my lord.
  Ham. Upon the talk of the poisoning?
  Hor. I did very well note him.
  Ham.   Aha
! Come, some music! Come, the recorders!
         For if the King like not the comedy,
         Wh
y then, belike he likes it not, perdy.
    Come, some music!

                Enter Rosencrantz a
nd Guildenstern.

  Guil. Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.
  Ham. Sir, a whole history
.
  Guil. The King, sir-
  Ham. Ay, sir, what of him?
  Guil. Is in his retirement, marvellous di
stemper'd.
  Ham. With drink, sir?
  Guil. No, my lord; rather with choler.
  Ham. Your wisdom sh
ould show itself more richer to signify this
to
    the doctor; for me to put him to his purgation
 would perhaps
    plunge him into far more choler.
  Guil. Good my lord, put your discourse into 
some frame, and
start
    not so wildly from my affair.
  Ham. I am tame, sir; pronounce.
  Guil
. The Queen, your mother, in most great affliction of
spirit
    hath sent me to you.
  Ham. You 
are welcome.
  Guil. Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right
breed.
    If it shall 
please you to make me a wholesome answer, I will
do
    your mother's commandment; if not, your pa
rdon and my return
    shall be the end of my business.
  Ham. Sir, I cannot.
  Guil. What, my lo
rd?
  Ham. Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseas'd. But, sir,
such
    answer as I can mak
e, you shall command; or rather, as you
say,
    my mother. Therefore no more, but to the matter! 
My mother,
you
    say-
  Ros. Then thus she says: your behaviour hath struck her into
    amaze
ment and admiration.
  Ham. O wonderful son, that can so stonish a mother! But is
there no
    se
quel at the heels of this mother's admiration? Impart.
  Ros. She desires to speak with you in her 
closet ere you go to
bed.
  Ham. We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any
    f
urther trade with us?
  Ros. My lord, you once did love me.
  Ham. And do still, by these pickers 
and stealers!
  Ros. Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? You do
surely
    bar the doo
r upon your own liberty, if you deny your griefs
to
    your friend.
  Ham. Sir, I lack advanceme
nt.
  Ros. How can that be, when you have the voice of the King
himself
    for your succession i
n Denmark?
  Ham. Ay, sir, but 'while the grass grows'- the proverb is
something
    musty.

  
                   Enter the Players with recorders.

    O, the recorders! Let me see one. To wit
hdraw with you- why
do
    you go about to recover the wind of me, as if you would drive
me
    
into a toil?
  Guil. O my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too
unmannerly.
  Ham. I do no
t well understand that. Will you play upon this
pipe?
  Guil. My lord, I cannot.
  Ham. I pray yo
u.
  Guil. Believe me, I cannot.
  Ham. I do beseech you.
  Guil. I know, no touch of it, my lord
.
  Ham. It is as easy as lying. Govern these ventages with your
    fingers and thumbs, give it b
reath with your mouth, and it
will
    discourse most eloquent music. Look you, these are the stop
s.
  Guil. But these cannot I command to any utt'rance of harmony. I
    have not the skill.
  Ha
m. Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me!
You
    would play upon me; you would s
eem to know my stops; you
would
    pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound me from my

    lowest note to the top of my compass; and there is much
music,
    excellent voice, in this l
ittle organ, yet cannot you make it
    speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am easier to be play'd on th
an
a
    pipe? Call me what instrument you will, though you can fret
me,
    you cannot play upo
n me.

                        Enter Polonius.

    God bless you, sir!
  Pol. My lord, the Que
en would speak with you, and presently.
  Ham. Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a 
camel?
  Pol. By th' mass, and 'tis like a camel indeed.
  Ham. Methinks it is like a weasel.
  P
ol. It is back'd like a weasel.
  Ham. Or like a whale.
  Pol. Very like a whale.
  Ham. Then wil
l I come to my mother by-and-by.- They fool me to
the
    top of my bent.- I will come by-and-by.

  Pol. I will say so.                                      Exit.
  Ham. 'By-and-by' is easily said
.- Leave me, friends.
                                        [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]

    'Tis 
now the very witching time of night,
    When churchyards yawn, and hell itself breathes out
    C
ontagion to this world. Now could I drink hot blood
    And do such bitter business as the day
   
 Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother!
    O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever
  
  The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom.
    Let me be cruel, not unnatural;
    I will speak dag
gers to her, but use none.
    My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites-
    How in my words somev
er she be shent,
    To give them seals never, my soul, consent!             Exit.




Scene I
II.
A room in the Castle.

Enter King, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.

  King. I like him not, 
nor stands it safe with us
    To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;
    I your commiss
ion will forthwith dispatch,
    And he to England shall along with you.
    The terms of our esta
te may not endure
    Hazard so near us as doth hourly grow
    Out of his lunacies.
  Guil. We w
ill ourselves provide.
    Most holy and religious fear it is
    To keep those many many bodies s
afe
    That live and feed upon your Majesty.
  Ros. The single and peculiar life is bound
    Wi
th all the strength and armour of the mind
    To keep itself from noyance; but much more
    That
 spirit upon whose weal depends and rests
    The lives of many. The cesse of majesty
    Dies not
 alone, but like a gulf doth draw
    What's near it with it. It is a massy wheel,
    Fix'd on th
e summit of the highest mount,
    To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
    Are mortis'
d and adjoin'd; which when it falls,
    Each small annexment, petty consequence,
    Attends the 
boist'rous ruin. Never alone
    Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.
  King. Arm you, I p
ray you, to this speedy voyage;
    For we will fetters put upon this fear,
    Which now goes too
 free-footed.
  Both. We will haste us.
                                               Exeunt Gent
lemen.

                   Enter Polonius.

  Pol. My lord, he's going to his mother's closet.

    Behind the arras I'll convey myself
    To hear the process. I'll warrant she'll tax him home;

    And, as you said, and wisely was it said,
    'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,

    Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear
    The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, m
y liege.
    I'll call upon you ere you go to bed
    And tell you what I know.
  King. Thanks, d
ear my lord.
                                                Exit [Polonius].
    O, my offence is
 rank, it smells to heaven;
    It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,
    A brother's murther! P
ray can I not,
    Though inclination be as sharp as will.
    My stronger guilt defeats my strong
 intent,
    And, like a man to double business bound,
    I stand in pause where I shall first be
gin,
    And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
    Were thicker than itself with brother's bl
ood,
    Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
    To wash it white as snow? Whereto serve
s mercy
    But to confront the visage of offence?
    And what's in prayer but this twofold force
,
    To be forestalled ere we come to fall,
    Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;
    M
y fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer
    Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murther'?

    That cannot be; since I am still possess'd
    Of those effects for which I did the murther-
 
   My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.
    May one be pardon'd and retain th' offence?
    
In the corrupted currents of this world
    Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,
    And of
t 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
    Buys out the law; but 'tis not so above.
    There is no s
huffling; there the action lies
    In his true nature, and we ourselves compell'd,
    Even to th
e teeth and forehead of our faults,
    To give in evidence. What then? What rests?
    Try what r
epentance can. What can it not?
    Yet what can it when one cannot repent?
    O wretched state! 
O bosom black as death!
    O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
    Art more engag'd! Help,
 angels! Make assay.
    Bow, stubborn knees; and heart with strings of steel,
    Be soft as sine
ws of the new-born babe!
    All may be well.                                  He kneels.

      
                   Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
    And now I'
ll do't. And so he goes to heaven,
    And so am I reveng'd. That would be scann'd.
    A villain 
kills my father; and for that,
    I, his sole son, do this same villain send
    To heaven.
    
Why, this is hire and salary, not revenge!
    He took my father grossly, full of bread,
    With 
all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
    And how his audit stands, who knows save heaven?

    But in our circumstance and course of thought,
    'Tis heavy with him; and am I then reveng'd,

    To take him in the purging of his soul,
    When he is fit and seasoned for his passage?
   
 No.
    Up, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent.
    When he is drunk asleep; or in his rage;

    Or in th' incestuous pleasure of his bed;
    At gaming, swearing, or about some act
    Tha
t has no relish of salvation in't-
    Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,
    And t
hat his soul may be as damn'd and black
    As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays.
    This ph
ysic but prolongs thy sickly days.              Exit.
  King. [rises] My words fly up, my thoughts 
remain below.
    Words without thoughts never to heaven go.             Exit.




Scene IV.

The Queen's closet.

Enter Queen and Polonius.

  Pol. He will come straight. Look you lay home 
to him.
    Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,
    And that your Grace hath scr
een'd and stood between
    Much heat and him. I'll silence me even here.
    Pray you be round wi
th him.
  Ham. (within) Mother, mother, mother!
  Queen. I'll warrant you; fear me not. Withdraw; 
I hear him
coming.
                              [Polonius hides behind the arras.]

           
               Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Now, mother, what's the matter?
  Queen. Hamlet, thou hast t
hy father much offended.
  Ham. Mother, you have my father much offended.
  Queen. Come, come, you
 answer with an idle tongue.
  Ham. Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
  Queen. Why, how n
ow, Hamlet?
  Ham. What's the matter now?
  Queen. Have you forgot me?
  Ham. No, by the rood, no
t so!
    You are the Queen, your husband's brother's wife,
    And (would it were not so!) you ar
e my mother.
  Queen. Nay, then I'll set those to you that can speak.
  Ham. Come, come, and sit y
ou down. You shall not budge;
    You go not till I set you up a glass
    Where you may see the i
nmost part of you.
  Queen. What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murther me?
    Help, help, ho!
  Po
l. [behind] What, ho! help, help, help!
  Ham. [draws] How now? a rat? Dead for a ducat, dead!
   
         [Makes a pass through the arras and] kills Polonius.
  Pol. [behind] O, I am slain!
  Que
en. O me, what hast thou done?
  Ham. Nay, I know not. Is it the King?
  Queen. O, what a rash and
 bloody deed is this!
  Ham. A bloody deed- almost as bad, good mother,
    As kill a king, and ma
rry with his brother.
  Queen. As kill a king?
  Ham. Ay, lady, it was my word.
                 
        [Lifts up the arras and sees Polonius.]
    Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!

    I took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune.
    Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.

    Leave wringing of your hands. Peace! sit you down
    And let me wring your heart; for so I sh
all
    If it be made of penetrable stuff;
    If damned custom have not braz'd it so
    That it
 is proof and bulwark against sense.
  Queen. What have I done that thou dar'st wag thy tongue
   
 In noise so rude against me?
  Ham. Such an act
    That blurs the grace and blush of modesty;
 
   Calls virtue hypocrite; takes off the rose
    From the fair forehead of an innocent love,
    
And sets a blister there; makes marriage vows
    As false as dicers' oaths. O, such a deed
    As
 from the body of contraction plucks
    The very soul, and sweet religion makes
    A rhapsody of
 words! Heaven's face doth glow;
    Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
    With tristful visag
e, as against the doom,
    Is thought-sick at the act.
  Queen. Ah me, what act,
    That roars 
so loud and thunders in the index?
  Ham. Look here upon th's picture, and on this,
    The counte
rfeit presentment of two brothers.
    See what a grace was seated on this brow;
    Hyperion's cu
rls; the front of Jove himself;
    An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
    A station like 
the herald Mercury
    New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill:
    A combination and a form indeed

    Where every god did seem to set his seal
    To give the world assurance of a man.
    This wa
s your husband. Look you now what follows.
    Here is your husband, like a mildew'd ear
    Blast
ing his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
    Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
    A
nd batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes
    You cannot call it love; for at your age
    The hey
day in the blood is tame, it's humble,
    And waits upon the judgment; and what judgment
    Woul
d step from this to this? Sense sure you have,
    Else could you not have motion; but sure that se
nse
    Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,
    Nor sense to ecstacy was ne'er so thrall'd
 
   But it reserv'd some quantity of choice
    To serve in such a difference. What devil was't
   
 That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
    Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
   
 Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
    Or but a sickly part of one true sense
    Cou
ld not so mope.
    O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
    If thou canst mutine in a ma
tron's bones,
    To flaming youth let virtue be as wax
    And melt in her own fire. Proclaim no 
shame
    When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
    Since frost itself as actively doth bur
n,
    And reason panders will.
  Queen. O Hamlet, speak no more!
    Thou turn'st mine eyes into
 my very soul,
    And there I see such black and grained spots
    As will not leave their tinct.

  Ham. Nay, but to live
    In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
    Stew'd in corruption, hone
ying and making love
    Over the nasty sty!
  Queen. O, speak to me no more!
    These words lik
e daggers enter in mine ears.
    No more, sweet Hamlet!
  Ham. A murtherer and a villain!
    A 
slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
    Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
    A cutp
urse of the empire and the rule,
    That from a shelf the precious diadem stole
    And put it in
 his pocket!
  Queen. No more!

                Enter the Ghost in his nightgown.

  Ham. A kin
g of shreds and patches!-
    Save me and hover o'er me with your wings,
    You heavenly guards! 
What would your gracious figure?
  Queen. Alas, he's mad!
  Ham. Do you not come your tardy son to
 chide,
    That, laps'd in time and passion, lets go by
    Th' important acting of your dread co
mmand?
    O, say!
  Ghost. Do not forget. This visitation
    Is but to whet thy almost blunted 
purpose.
    But look, amazement on thy mother sits.
    O, step between her and her fighting soul

    Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works.
    Speak to her, Hamlet.
  Ham. How is it with y
ou, lady?
  Queen. Alas, how is't with you,
    That you do bend your eye on vacancy,
    And wit
h th' encorporal air do hold discourse?
    Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
    And, 
as the sleeping soldiers in th' alarm,
    Your bedded hairs, like life in excrements,
    Start u
p and stand an end. O gentle son,
    Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
    Sprinkle cool p
atience! Whereon do you look?
  Ham. On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!
    His form and
 cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
    Would make them capable.- Do not look upon me,
    Lest
 with this piteous action you convert
    My stern effects. Then what I have to do
    Will want t
rue colour- tears perchance for blood.
  Queen. To whom do you speak this?
  Ham. Do you see nothi
ng there?
  Queen. Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
  Ham. Nor did you nothing hear?
  Quee
n. No, nothing but ourselves.
  Ham. Why, look you there! Look how it steals away!
    My father, 
in his habit as he liv'd!
    Look where he goes even now out at the portal!
                     
                                Exit Ghost.
  Queen. This is the very coinage of your brain.
    T
his bodiless creation ecstasy
    Is very cunning in.
  Ham. Ecstasy?
    My pulse as yours doth 
temperately keep time
    And makes as healthful music. It is not madness
    That I have utt'red.
 Bring me to the test,
    And I the matter will reword; which madness
    Would gambol from. Moth
er, for love of grace,
    Lay not that flattering unction to your soul
    That not your trespass
 but my madness speaks.
    It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
    Whiles rank corrupti
on, mining all within,
    Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
    Repent what's past; avo
id what is to come;
    And do not spread the compost on the weeds
    To make them ranker. Forgiv
e me this my virtue;
    For in the fatness of these pursy times
    Virtue itself of vice must pa
rdon beg-
    Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.
  Queen. O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my he
art in twain.
  Ham. O, throw away the worser part of it,
    And live the purer with the other ha
lf,
    Good night- but go not to my uncle's bed.
    Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
    Th
at monster, custom, who all sense doth eat
    Of habits evil, is angel yet in this,
    That to t
he use of actions fair and good
    He likewise gives a frock or livery,
    That aptly is put on.
 Refrain to-night,
    And that shall lend a kind of easiness
    To the next abstinence; the next
 more easy;
    For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
    And either [master] the devil, 
or throw him out
    With wondrous potency. Once more, good night;
    And when you are desirous t
o be blest,
    I'll blessing beg of you.- For this same lord,
    I do repent; but heaven hath pl
eas'd it so,
    To punish me with this, and this with me,
    That I must be their scourge and mi
nister.
    I will bestow him, and will answer well
    The death I gave him. So again, good night
.
    I must be cruel, only to be kind;
    Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.
    One wo
rd more, good lady.
  Queen. What shall I do?
  Ham. Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
  
  Let the bloat King tempt you again to bed;
    Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
 
   And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
    Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,

    Make you to ravel all this matter out,
    That I essentially am not in madness,
    But mad 
in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;
    For who that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
    Wou
ld from a paddock, from a bat, a gib
    Such dear concernings hide? Who would do so?
    No, in d
espite of sense and secrecy,
    Unpeg the basket on the house's top,
    Let the birds fly, and l
ike the famous ape,
    To try conclusions, in the basket creep
    And break your own neck down.

  Queen. Be thou assur'd, if words be made of breath,
    And breath of life, I have no life to br
eathe
    What thou hast said to me.
  Ham. I must to England; you know that?
  Queen. Alack,
  
  I had forgot! 'Tis so concluded on.
  Ham. There's letters seal'd; and my two schoolfellows,
   
 Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,
    They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way
    
And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
    For 'tis the sport to have the enginer
    Hoist with 
his own petar; and 't shall go hard
    But I will delve one yard below their mines
    And blow t
hem at the moon. O, 'tis most sweet
    When in one line two crafts directly meet.
    This man sh
all set me packing.
    I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.-
    Mother, good night.- Indee
d, this counsellor
    Is now most still, most secret, and most grave,
    Who was in life a fooli
sh peating knave.
    Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.
    Good night, mother.
        
          [Exit the Queen. Then] Exit Hamlet, tugging in
                                          
             Polonius.

ACT IV. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Ent
er King and Queen, with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  King. There's matter in these sighs. Thes
e profound heaves
    You must translate; 'tis fit we understand them.
    Where is your son?
  Q
ueen. Bestow this place on us a little while.
                          [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Gui
ldenstern.]
    Ah, mine own lord, what have I seen to-night!
  King. What, Gertrude? How does Ham
let?
  Queen. Mad as the sea and wind when both contend
    Which is the mightier. In his lawless 
fit
    Behind the arras hearing something stir,
    Whips out his rapier, cries 'A rat, a rat!'

    And in this brainish apprehension kills
    The unseen good old man.
  King. O heavy deed!
  
  It had been so with us, had we been there.
    His liberty is full of threats to all-
    To you
 yourself, to us, to every one.
    Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
    It will be l
aid to us, whose providence
    Should have kept short, restrain'd, and out of haunt
    This mad 
young man. But so much was our love
    We would not understand what was most fit,
    But, like t
he owner of a foul disease,
    To keep it from divulging, let it feed
    Even on the pith of lif
e. Where is he gone?
  Queen. To draw apart the body he hath kill'd;
    O'er whom his very madnes
s, like some ore
    Among a mineral of metals base,
    Shows itself pure. He weeps for what is d
one.
  King. O Gertrude, come away!
    The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch
    But we wi
ll ship him hence; and this vile deed
    We must with all our majesty and skill
    Both countena
nce and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!

             Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

    Friends
 both, go join you with some further aid.
    Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
    And from 
his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him.
    Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body
    I
nto the chapel. I pray you haste in this.
                          Exeunt [Rosencrantz and Guilden
stern].
    Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends
    And let them know both what we me
an to do
    And what's untimely done. [So haply slander-]
    Whose whisper o'er the world's diam
eter,
    As level as the cannon to his blank,
    Transports his poisoned shot- may miss our name

    And hit the woundless air.- O, come away!
    My soul is full of discord and dismay.
       
                                                  Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A passage in
 the Castle.

Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Safely stow'd.
  Gentlemen. (within) Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!

  Ham. But soft! What noise? Who calls on Hamlet? O, here they
come.

               Enter Rosenc
rantz and Guildenstern.

  Ros. What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
  Ham. Compounde
d it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
  Ros. Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
    And be
ar it to the chapel.
  Ham. Do not believe it.
  Ros. Believe what?
  Ham. That I can keep your c
ounsel, and not mine own. Besides,
to be
    demanded of a sponge, what replication should be made
 by the
son
    of a king?
  Ros. Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
  Ham. Ay, sir; that soaks 
up the King's countenance, his
rewards,
    his authorities. But such officers do the King best se
rvice
in
    the end. He keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his
jaw;
    first mouth'd, t
o be last swallowed. When he needs what you
have
    glean'd, it is but squeezing you and, sponge,
 you shall be
dry
    again.
  Ros. I understand you not, my lord.
  Ham. I am glad of it. A kna
vish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.
  Ros. My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with
 us
to
    the King.
  Ham. The body is with the King, but the King is not with the
body.
    T
he King is a thing-
  Guil. A thing, my lord?
  Ham. Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and al
l after.
                                                         Exeunt.




Scene III.
Elsi
nore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King.

  King. I have sent to seek him and to find the body.

    How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
    Yet must not we put the strong law on him.

    He's lov'd of the distracted multitude,
    Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;
  
  And where 'tis so, th' offender's scourge is weigh'd,
    But never the offence. To bear all smoo
th and even,
    This sudden sending him away must seem
    Deliberate pause. Diseases desperate g
rown
    By desperate appliance are reliev'd,
    Or not at all.

                    Enter Rose
ncrantz.

    How now O What hath befall'n?
  Ros. Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
   
 We cannot get from him.
  King. But where is he?
  Ros. Without, my lord; guarded, to know your p
leasure.
  King. Bring him before us.
  Ros. Ho, Guildenstern! Bring in my lord.

        Enter 
Hamlet and Guildenstern [with Attendants].

  King. Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
  Ham. At supp
er.
  King. At supper? Where?
  Ham. Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A certain
    conv
ocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your worm is
your
    only emperor for diet. We fat all 
creatures else to fat us,
and
    we fat ourselves for maggots. Your fat king and your lean
begga
r
    is but variable service- two dishes, but to one table. That's
the
    end.
  King. Alas, a
las!
  Ham. A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and
eat
    of the fish that ha
th fed of that worm.
  King. What dost thou mean by this?
  Ham. Nothing but to show you how a kin
g may go a progress
through
    the guts of a beggar.
  King. Where is Polonius?
  Ham. In heave
n. Send thither to see. If your messenger find him
not
    there, seek him i' th' other place your
self. But indeed, if
you
    find him not within this month, you shall nose him as you go
up
   
 the stair, into the lobby.
  King. Go seek him there. [To Attendants.]
  Ham. He will stay till y
ou come.
                                            [Exeunt Attendants.]
  King. Hamlet, this dee
d, for thine especial safety,-
    Which we do tender as we dearly grieve
    For that which thou 
hast done,- must send thee hence
    With fiery quickness. Therefore prepare thyself.
    The bark
 is ready and the wind at help,
    Th' associates tend, and everything is bent
    For England.

  Ham. For England?
  King. Ay, Hamlet.
  Ham. Good.
  King. So is it, if thou knew'st our purpos
es.
  Ham. I see a cherub that sees them. But come, for England!
    Farewell, dear mother.
  Kin
g. Thy loving father, Hamlet.
  Ham. My mother! Father and mother is man and wife; man and wife
is

    one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England!
Exit.
  King. Follow him at foot; tempt him
 with speed aboard.
    Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night.
    Away! for everything is se
al'd and done
    That else leans on th' affair. Pray you make haste.
                            
Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]
    And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught,-
    As m
y great power thereof may give thee sense,
    Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
    After
 the Danish sword, and thy free awe
    Pays homage to us,- thou mayst not coldly set
    Our sove
reign process, which imports at full,
    By letters congruing to that effect,
    The present dea
th of Hamlet. Do it, England;
    For like the hectic in my blood he rages,
    And thou must cure
 me. Till I know 'tis done,
    Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.             Exit.

Scene IV.
Near Elsinore.

Enter Fortinbras with his Army over the stage.

  For.
 Go, Captain, from me greet the Danish king.
    Tell him that by his license Fortinbras
    Crave
s the conveyance of a promis'd march
    Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.
    If that hi
s Majesty would aught with us,
    We shall express our duty in his eye;
    And let him know so.

  Capt. I will do't, my lord.
  For. Go softly on.
                                   Exeunt [all
 but the Captain].

       Enter Hamlet, Rosencrantz, [Guildenstern,] and others.

  Ham. Good s
ir, whose powers are these?
  Capt. They are of Norway, sir.
  Ham. How purpos'd, sir, I pray you?

  Capt. Against some part of Poland.
  Ham. Who commands them, sir?
  Capt. The nephew to old No
rway, Fortinbras.
  Ham. Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
    Or for some frontier?
  Cap
t. Truly to speak, and with no addition,
    We go to gain a little patch of ground
    That hath 
in it no profit but the name.
    To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
    Nor will it y
ield to Norway or the Pole
    A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
  Ham. Why, then the Polac
k never will defend it.
  Capt. Yes, it is already garrison'd.
  Ham. Two thousand souls and twent
y thousand ducats
    Will not debate the question of this straw.
    This is th' imposthume of mu
ch wealth and peace,
    That inward breaks, and shows no cause without
    Why the man dies.- I h
umbly thank you, sir.
  Capt. God b' wi' you, sir.                             [Exit.]
  Ros. Will
't please you go, my lord?
  Ham. I'll be with you straight. Go a little before.
                 
                       [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]
    How all occasions do inform against me
    And
 spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
    If his chief good and market of his time
    Be but to s
leep and feed? A beast, no more.
    Sure he that made us with such large discourse,
    Looking b
efore and after, gave us not
    That capability and godlike reason
    To fust in us unus'd. Now,
 whether it be
    Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple
    Of thinking too precisely on th' e
vent,-
    A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
    And ever three parts coward,- 
I do not know
    Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do,'
    Sith I have cause, and will, and
 strength, and means
    To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me.
    Witness this army of such
 mass and charge,
    Led by a delicate and tender prince,
    Whose spirit, with divine ambition 
puff'd,
    Makes mouths at the invisible event,
    Exposing what is mortal and unsure
    To al
l that fortune, death, and danger dare,
    Even for an eggshell. Rightly to be great
    Is not t
o stir without great argument,
    But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
    When honour's at the
 stake. How stand I then,
    That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,
    Excitements of my r
eason and my blood,
    And let all sleep, while to my shame I see
    The imminent death of twent
y thousand men
    That for a fantasy and trick of fame
    Go to their graves like beds, fight fo
r a plot
    Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
    Which is not tomb enough and continent

    To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,
    My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!   
         Exit.

Scene V.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter Horatio, Quee
n, and a Gentleman.

  Queen. I will not speak with her.
  Gent. She is importunate, indeed distr
act.
    Her mood will needs be pitied.
  Queen. What would she have?
  Gent. She speaks much of 
her father; says she hears
    There's tricks i' th' world, and hems, and beats her heart;
    Spu
rns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,
    That carry but half sense. Her speech is nothi
ng,
    Yet the unshaped use of it doth move
    The hearers to collection; they aim at it,
    A
nd botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;
    Which, as her winks and nods and gestures yiel
d them,
    Indeed would make one think there might be thought,
    Though nothing sure, yet much 
unhappily.
  Hor. 'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew
    Dangerous conjectures in
 ill-breeding minds.
  Queen. Let her come in.
                                               [Exi
t Gentleman.]
    [Aside] To my sick soul (as sin's true nature is)
    Each toy seems Prologue to
 some great amiss.
    So full of artless jealousy is guilt
    It spills itself in fearing to be 
spilt.

                 Enter Ophelia distracted.

  Oph. Where is the beauteous Majesty of Den
mark?
  Queen. How now, Ophelia?
  Oph. (sings)
         How should I your true-love know
      
     From another one?
         By his cockle bat and' staff
           And his sandal shoon.

 
 Queen. Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
  Oph. Say you? Nay, pray You mark.

    (Sings
) He is dead and gone, lady,
              He is dead and gone;
            At his head a grass-gr
een turf,
              At his heels a stone.

    O, ho!
  Queen. Nay, but Ophelia-
  Oph. Pra
y you mark.

    (Sings) White his shroud as the mountain snow-

                    Enter King.


  Queen. Alas, look here, my lord!
  Oph. (Sings)
           Larded all with sweet flowers;
 
        Which bewept to the grave did not go
           With true-love showers.

  King. How do y
ou, pretty lady?
  Oph. Well, God dild you! They say the owl was a baker's
daughter.
    Lord, we
 know what we are, but know not what we may be. God
be at
    your table!
  King. Conceit upon he
r father.
  Oph. Pray let's have no words of this; but when they ask, you
what
    it means, say 
you this:

    (Sings) To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,
              All in the morning bedti
me,
            And I a maid at your window,
              To be your Valentine.

            Th
en up he rose and donn'd his clo'es
              And dupp'd the chamber door,
            Let in 
the maid, that out a maid
              Never departed more.

  King. Pretty Ophelia!
  Oph. Ind
eed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't!

    [Sings] By Gis and by Saint Charity,
      
        Alack, and fie for shame!
            Young men will do't if they come to't
              
By Cock, they are to blame.

            Quoth she, 'Before you tumbled me,
              You pro
mis'd me to wed.'

    He answers:

            'So would I 'a' done, by yonder sun,
          
    An thou hadst not come to my bed.'

  King. How long hath she been thus?
  Oph. I hope all wi
ll be well. We must be patient; but I cannot
    choose but weep to think they would lay him i' th'
 cold
ground.
    My brother shall know of it; and so I thank you for your good
    counsel. Come
, my coach! Good night, ladies. Good night,
sweet
    ladies. Good night, good night.             
            Exit
  King. Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.
                      
                           [Exit Horatio.]

    O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs
 
   All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
    When sorrows come, they come not single s
pies.
    But in battalions! First, her father slain;
    Next, your son gone, and he most violent
 author
    Of his own just remove; the people muddied,
    Thick and and unwholesome in their tho
ughts and whispers
    For good Polonius' death, and we have done but greenly
    In hugger-mugger
 to inter him; poor Ophelia
    Divided from herself and her fair judgment,
    Without the which 
we are pictures or mere beasts;
    Last, and as much containing as all these,
    Her brother is 
in secret come from France;
    And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
    Feeds on his wonder, k
eep, himself in clouds,
    With pestilent speeches of his father's death,
    Wherein necessity, 
of matter beggar'd,
    Will nothing stick our person to arraign
    In ear and ear. O my dear Ger
trude, this,
    Like to a murd'ring piece, in many places
    Give me superfluous death.         
         A noise within.
  Queen. Alack, what noise is this?
  King. Where are my Switzers? Let th
em guard the door.

                     Enter a Messenger.

    What is the matter?
  Mess. Sa
ve Yourself, my lord:
    The ocean, overpeering of his list,
    Eats not the flats with more imp
etuous haste
    Than Young Laertes, in a riotous head,
    O'erbears Your offices. The rabble cal
l him lord;
    And, as the world were now but to begin,
    Antiquity forgot, custom not known,

    The ratifiers and props of every word,
    They cry 'Choose we! Laertes shall be king!'
    Ca
ps, hands, and tongues applaud it to the clouds,
    'Laertes shall be king! Laertes king!'
      
                                           A noise within.
  Queen. How cheerfully on the false tra
il they cry!
    O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!
  King. The doors are broke.

      
              Enter Laertes with others.

  Laer. Where is this king?- Sirs, staid you all without
.
  All. No, let's come in!
  Laer. I pray you give me leave.
  All. We will, we will!
  Laer. I
 thank you. Keep the door.      [Exeunt his Followers.]
    O thou vile king,
    Give me my fathe
r!
  Queen. Calmly, good Laertes.
  Laer. That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard;
  
  Cries cuckold to my father; brands the harlot
    Even here between the chaste unsmirched brows

    Of my true mother.
  King. What is the cause, Laertes,
    That thy rebellion looks so giantli
ke?
    Let him go, Gertrude. Do not fear our person.
    There's such divinity doth hedge a king

    That treason can but peep to what it would,
    Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,
  
  Why thou art thus incens'd. Let him go, Gertrude.
    Speak, man.
  Laer. Where is my father?
 
 King. Dead.
  Queen. But not by him!
  King. Let him demand his fill.
  Laer. How came he dead? 
I'll not be juggled with:
    To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil
    Conscience and 
grace, to the profoundest pit!
    I dare damnation. To this point I stand,
    That both the worl
d, I give to negligence,
    Let come what comes; only I'll be reveng'd
    Most throughly for my 
father.
  King. Who shall stay you?
  Laer. My will, not all the world!
    And for my means, I'l
l husband them so well
    They shall go far with little.
  King. Good Laertes,
    If you desire
 to know the certainty
    Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge
    That sweepst
ake you will draw both friend and foe,
    Winner and loser?
  Laer. None but his enemies.
  King
. Will you know them then?
  Laer. To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms
    And, like th
e kind life-rend'ring pelican,
    Repast them with my blood.
  King. Why, now You speak
    Like
 a good child and a true gentleman.
    That I am guiltless of your father's death,
    And am mos
t sensibly in grief for it,
    It shall as level to your judgment pierce
    As day does to your 
eye.
                              A noise within: 'Let her come in.'
  Laer. How now? What noise 
is that?

                      Enter Ophelia.

    O heat, dry up my brains! Tears seven times 
salt
    Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!
    By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by we
ight
    Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!
    Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!

    O heavens! is't possible a young maid's wits
    Should be as mortal as an old man's life?
   
 Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,
    It sends some precious instance of itself
    Af
ter the thing it loves.

  Oph. (sings)
         They bore him barefac'd on the bier
           
(Hey non nony, nony, hey nony)
         And in his grave rain'd many a tear.

    Fare you well, 
my dove!
  Laer. Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
    It could not move thus.
  O
ph. You must sing 'A-down a-down, and you call him a-down-a.'
O,
    how the wheel becomes it! It 
is the false steward, that stole
his
    master's daughter.
  Laer. This nothing's more than matt
er.
  Oph. There's rosemary, that's for remembrance. Pray you, love,
    remember. And there is pa
nsies, that's for thoughts.
  Laer. A document in madness! Thoughts and remembrance fitted.
  Oph.
 There's fennel for you, and columbines. There's rue for
you,
    and here's some for me. We may c
all it herb of grace o'
Sundays.
    O, you must wear your rue with a difference! There's a daisy.

I
    would give you some violets, but they wither'd all when my
father
    died. They say he m
ade a good end.

    [Sings] For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.

  Laer. Thought and afflictio
n, passion, hell itself,
    She turns to favour and to prettiness.
  Oph. (sings)
         And w
ill he not come again?
         And will he not come again?
           No, no, he is dead;
      
     Go to thy deathbed;
         He never will come again.

         His beard was as white as s
now,
         All flaxen was his poll.
           He is gone, he is gone,
           And we cast 
away moan.
         God 'a'mercy on his soul!

    And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God b'
 wi' you.
Exit.
  Laer. Do you see this, O God?
  King. Laertes, I must commune with your grief,

    Or you deny me right. Go but apart,
    Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will,
   
 And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me.
    If by direct or by collateral hand
    They 
find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,
    Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours,
   
 To you in satisfaction; but if not,
    Be you content to lend your patience to us,
    And we sh
all jointly labour with your soul
    To give it due content.
  Laer. Let this be so.
    His mea
ns of death, his obscure funeral-
    No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,
    No noble
 rite nor formal ostentation,-
    Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
    That I mus
t call't in question.
  King. So you shall;
    And where th' offence is let the great axe fall.

    I pray you go with me.
                                                          Exeunt

grapple I
    boarded them. On the instant they got cle
ar of our ship; so I
    alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with me like

Scene VII.
Elsinore. Another room in the Castle.

Enter 
King and Laertes.

  King. Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
    And You must put me 
in your heart for friend,
    Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
    That he which hath 
your noble father slain
    Pursued my life.
  Laer. It well appears. But tell me
    Why you pro
ceeded not against these feats
    So crimeful and so capital in nature,
    As by your safety, wi
sdom, all things else,
    You mainly were stirr'd up.
  King. O, for two special reasons,
    Wh
ich may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,
    But yet to me they are strong. The Queen his moth
er
    Lives almost by his looks; and for myself,-
    My virtue or my plague, be it either which,
-
    She's so conjunctive to my life and soul
    That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,

    I could not but by her. The other motive
    Why to a public count I might not go
    Is the 
great love the general gender bear him,
    Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
    Wo
uld, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
    Convert his gives to graces; so that my arrows
,
    Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,
    Would have reverted to my bow again,
    And 
not where I had aim'd them.
  Laer. And so have I a noble father lost;
    A sister driven into de
sp'rate terms,
    Whose worth, if praises may go back again,
    Stood challenger on mount of all
 the age
    For her perfections. But my revenge will come.
  King. Break not your sleeps for that
. You must not think
    That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
    That we can let our beard 
be shook with danger,
    And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more.
    I lov'd your fath
er, and we love ourself,
    And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine-

                 Enter
 a Messenger with letters.

    How now? What news?
  Mess. Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:
    T
his to your Majesty; this to the Queen.
  King. From Hamlet? Who brought them?
  Mess. Sailors, my
 lord, they say; I saw them not.
    They were given me by Claudio; he receiv'd them
    Of him th
at brought them.
  King. Laertes, you shall hear them.
    Leave us.
                            
                     Exit Messenger.
    [Reads]'High and Mighty,-You shall know I am set naked on

your
    kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes;
    when I shall (first as
king your pardon thereunto) recount the
    occasion of my sudden and more strange return.
       
                                              'HAMLET.'
    What should this mean? Are all the rest
 come back?
    Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?
  Laer. Know you the hand?
  King. 'Tis H
amlet's character. 'Naked!'
    And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'
    Can you advise me?

  Laer. I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come!
    It warms the very sickness in my heart
  
  That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,
    'Thus didest thou.'
  King. If it be so, Laerte
s
    (As how should it be so? how otherwise?),
    Will you be rul'd by me?
  Laer. Ay my lord,

    So you will not o'errule me to a peace.
  King. To thine own peace. If he be now return'd
   
 As checking at his voyage, and that he means
    No more to undertake it, I will work him
    To 
exploit now ripe in my device,
    Under the which he shall not choose but fall;
    And for his d
eath no wind shall breathe
    But even his mother shall uncharge the practice
    And call it acc
ident.
  Laer. My lord, I will be rul'd;
    The rather, if you could devise it so
    That I mig
ht be the organ.
  King. It falls right.
    You have been talk'd of since your travel much,
    
And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality
    Wherein they say you shine, Your sum of parts
    
Did not together pluck such envy from him
    As did that one; and that, in my regard,
    Of the 
unworthiest siege.
  Laer. What part is that, my lord?
  King. A very riband in the cap of youth-

    Yet needfull too; for youth no less becomes
    The light and careless livery that it wears
 
   Than settled age his sables and his weeds,
    Importing health and graveness. Two months since

    Here was a gentleman of Normandy.
    I have seen myself, and serv'd against, the French,
   
 And they can well on horseback; but this gallant
    Had witchcraft in't. He grew unto his seat,

    And to such wondrous doing brought his horse
    As had he been incorps'd and demi-natur'd
   
 With the brave beast. So far he topp'd my thought
    That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
  
  Come short of what he did.
  Laer. A Norman was't?
  King. A Norman.
  Laer. Upon my life, Lamo
und.
  King. The very same.
  Laer. I know him well. He is the broach indeed
    And gem of all t
he nation.
  King. He made confession of you;
    And gave you such a masterly report
    For art
 and exercise in your defence,
    And for your rapier most especially,
    That he cried out 'two
uld be a sight indeed
    If one could match you. The scrimers of their nation
    He swore had ne
ither motion, guard, nor eye,
    If you oppos'd them. Sir, this report of his
    Did Hamlet so e
nvenom with his envy
    That he could nothing do but wish and beg
    Your sudden coming o'er to 
play with you.
    Now, out of this-
  Laer. What out of this, my lord?
  King. Laertes, was your
 father dear to you?
    Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
    A face without a heart,'
 
 Laer. Why ask you this?
  King. Not that I think you did not love your father;
    But that I kno
w love is begun by time,
    And that I see, in passages of proof,
    Time qualifies the spark an
d fire of it.
    There lives within the very flame of love
    A kind of wick or snuff that will 
abate it;
    And nothing is at a like goodness still;
    For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
  
  Dies in his own too-much. That we would do,
    We should do when we would; for this 'would' chan
ges,
    And hath abatements and delays as many
    As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents
;
    And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
    That hurts by easing. But to the quic
k o' th' ulcer!
    Hamlet comes back. What would you undertake
    To show yourself your father's
 son in deed
    More than in words?
  Laer. To cut his throat i' th' church!
  King. No place in
deed should murther sanctuarize;
    Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,
    Will yo
u do this? Keep close within your chamber.
    Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home.
    W
e'll put on those shall praise your excellence
    And set a double varnish on the fame
    The Fr
enchman gave you; bring you in fine together
    And wager on your heads. He, being remiss,
    Mo
st generous, and free from all contriving,
    Will not peruse the foils; so that with ease,
    O
r with a little shuffling, you may choose
    A sword unbated, and, in a pass of practice,
    Req
uite him for your father.
  Laer. I will do't!
    And for that purpose I'll anoint my sword.
   
 I bought an unction of a mountebank,
    So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
    Where it draw
s blood no cataplasm so rare,
    Collected from all simples that have virtue
    Under the moon, 
can save the thing from death
    This is but scratch'd withal. I'll touch my point
    With this 
contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
    It may be death.
  King. Let's further think of this,

    Weigh what convenience both of time and means
    May fit us to our shape. If this should fal
l,
    And that our drift look through our bad performance.
    'Twere better not assay'd. Therefo
re this project
    Should have a back or second, that might hold
    If this did blast in proof. 
Soft! let me see.
    We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings-
    I ha't!
    When in your mo
tion you are hot and dry-
    As make your bouts more violent to that end-
    And that he calls f
or drink, I'll have prepar'd him
    A chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,
    If he by ch
ance escape your venom'd stuck,
    Our purpose may hold there.- But stay, what noise,

         
                  Enter Queen.

    How now, sweet queen?
  Queen. One woe doth tread upon anothe
r's heel,
    So fast they follow. Your sister's drown'd, Laertes.
  Laer. Drown'd! O, where?
  Q
ueen. There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
    That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream.

    There with fantastic garlands did she come
    Of crowflowers, nettles, daisies, and long purp
les,
    That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
    But our cold maids do dead men's fingers 
call them.
    There on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds
    Clamb'ring to hang, an envious sl
iver broke,
    When down her weedy trophies and herself
    Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothe
s spread wide
    And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up;
    Which time she chaunted snatches
 of old tunes,
    As one incapable of her own distress,
    Or like a creature native and indued

    Unto that element; but long it could not be
    Till that her garments, heavy with their drink
,
    Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay
    To muddy death.
  Laer. Alas, then she is
 drown'd?
  Queen. Drown'd, drown'd.
  Laer. Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
    And t
herefore I forbid my tears; but yet
    It is our trick; nature her custom holds,
    Let shame sa
y what it will. When these are gone,
    The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord.
    I have a speec
h of fire, that fain would blaze
    But that this folly douts it.                          Exit.

  King. Let's follow, Gertrude.
    How much I had to do to calm his rage I
    Now fear I this wi
ll give it start again;
    Therefore let's follow.
                                              
           Exeunt.

ACT V. Scene I.
Elsinore. A churchyard.

Enter two Clowns
, [with spades and pickaxes].

  Clown. Is she to be buried in Christian burial when she
wilfully

    seeks her own salvation?
  Other. I tell thee she is; therefore make her grave straight.
   
 The crowner hath sate on her, and finds it Christian burial.
  Clown. How can that be, unless she 
drown'd herself in her own
    defence?
  Other. Why, 'tis found so.
  Clown. It must be se offen
dendo; it cannot be else. For here
lies
    the point: if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an a
ct; and
an
    act hath three branches-it is to act, to do, and to perform;
    argal, she drown'
d herself wittingly.
  Other. Nay, but hear you, Goodman Delver!
  Clown. Give me leave. Here lies
 the water; good. Here stands
the
    man; good. If the man go to this water and drown himself, it

is,
    will he nill he, he goes- mark you that. But if the water
come to
    him and drown him
, he drowns not himself. Argal, he that is
not
    guilty of his own death shortens not his own li
fe.
  Other. But is this law?
  Clown. Ay, marry, is't- crowner's quest law.
  Other. Will you ha
' the truth an't? If this had not been a
    gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o' Christ
ian
burial.
  Clown. Why, there thou say'st! And the more pity that great
folk
    should have c
ount'nance in this world to drown or hang
themselves
    more than their even-Christian. Come, my 
spade! There is no
    ancient gentlemen but gard'ners, ditchers, and grave-makers.
They
    hold
 up Adam's profession.
  Other. Was he a gentleman?
  Clown. 'A was the first that ever bore arms.

  Other. Why, he had none.
  Clown. What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the
Scripture?

    The Scripture says Adam digg'd. Could he dig without arms?
I'll
    put another question to 
thee. If thou answerest me not to the
    purpose, confess thyself-
  Other. Go to!
  Clown. What
 is he that builds stronger than either the mason,
the
    shipwright, or the carpenter?
  Other.
 The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand
    tenants.
  Clown. I like thy wit well, 
in good faith. The gallows does
well.
    But how does it well? It does well to those that do ill.
 Now,
    thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the
    church. Argal, the gallo
ws may do well to thee. To't again,
come!
  Other. Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright,
 or a
    carpenter?
  Clown. Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
  Other. Marry, now I can tell!
  Cl
own. To't.
  Other. Mass, I cannot tell.

                 Enter Hamlet and Horatio afar off.


  Clown. Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull ass
will
    not mend his pace with bea
ting; and when you are ask'd this
    question next, say 'a grave-maker.' The houses he makes lasts

    till doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan; fetch me a stoup of
    liquor.
                    
                        [Exit Second Clown.]


                       [Clown digs and] sings.


       In youth when I did love, did love,
         Methought it was very sweet;
       To contrac
t- O- the time for- a- my behove,
         O, methought there- a- was nothing- a- meet.

  Ham. H
as this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings
at
    grave-making?
  Hor. Custom hath 
made it in him a property of easiness.
  Ham. 'Tis e'en so. The hand of little employment hath the

daintier
    sense.
  Clown. (sings)
         But age with his stealing steps
           Hath c
lawed me in his clutch,
         And hath shipped me intil the land,
           As if I had never 
been such.
                                            [Throws up a skull.]

  Ham. That skull ha
d a tongue in it, and could sing once. How
the
    knave jowls it to the ground,as if 'twere Cain'
s jawbone,
that
    did the first murther! This might be the pate of a
Politician,
    which thi
s ass now o'erreaches; one that would circumvent
God,
    might it not?
  Hor. It might, my lord.

  Ham. Or of a courtier, which could say 'Good morrow, sweet
lord!
    How dost thou, good lord?
' This might be my Lord Such-a-one,
that
    prais'd my Lord Such-a-one's horse when he meant to b
eg it-
might
    it not?
  Hor. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Why, e'en so! and now my Lady Worm's, chaple
ss, and
knock'd
    about the mazzard with a sexton's spade. Here's fine
revolution,
    and we 
had the trick to see't. Did these bones cost no more
the
    breeding but to play at loggets with 
'em? Mine ache to think
    on't.
  Clown. (Sings)
         A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,
    
       For and a shrouding sheet;
         O, a Pit of clay for to be made
           For such a g
uest is meet.
                                      Throws up [another skull].

  Ham. There's an
other. Why may not that be the skull of a
lawyer?
    Where be his quiddits now, his quillets, his
 cases, his
tenures,
    and his tricks? Why does he suffer this rude knave now to
knock
    him
 about the sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell
him
    of his action of battery? Hum! Th
is fellow might be in's time
a
    great buyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizances,
his

    fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries. Is this the fine
of
    his fines, and the recov
ery of his recoveries, to have his
fine
    pate full of fine dirt? Will his vouchers vouch him no
 more
of
    his purchases, and double ones too, than the length and
breadth
    of a pair of in
dentures? The very conveyances of his lands
will
    scarcely lie in this box; and must th' inheri
tor himself have
no
    more, ha?
  Hor. Not a jot more, my lord.
  Ham. Is not parchment made o
f sheepskins?
  Hor. Ay, my lord, And of calveskins too.
  Ham. They are sheep and calves which se
ek out assurance in
that. I
    will speak to this fellow. Whose grave's this, sirrah?
  Clown. M
ine, sir.

    [Sings] O, a pit of clay for to be made
              For such a guest is meet.


  Ham. I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in't.
  Clown. You lie out on't, sir, and theref
ore 'tis not yours.
    For my part, I do not lie in't, yet it is mine.
  Ham. Thou dost lie in't,
 to be in't and say it is thine. 'Tis
for
    the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.

  Clown. 'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away again from me to you.
  Ham. What man dost thou dig it 
for?
  Clown. For no man, sir.
  Ham. What woman then?
  Clown. For none neither.
  Ham. Who is 
to be buried in't?
  Clown. One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's
dead.
  Ham. How
 absolute the knave is! We must speak by the card, or
    equivocation will undo us. By the Lord, H
oratio, this three
years
    I have taken note of it, the age is grown so picked that the
toe
  
  of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he
galls
    his kibe.- How long hast thou
 been a grave-maker?
  Clown. Of all the days i' th' year, I came to't that day that
our
    last
 king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.
  Ham. How long is that since?
  Clown. Cannot you tell that? Ev
ery fool can tell that. It was
the
    very day that young Hamlet was born- he that is mad, and se
nt
    into England.
  Ham. Ay, marry, why was be sent into England?
  Clown. Why, because 'a was
 mad. 'A shall recover his wits
there;
    or, if 'a do not, 'tis no great matter there.
  Ham. W
hy?
  Clown. 'Twill not he seen in him there. There the men are as
mad as
    he.
  Ham. How cam
e he mad?
  Clown. Very strangely, they say.
  Ham. How strangely?
  Clown. Faith, e'en with losi
ng his wits.
  Ham. Upon what ground?
  Clown. Why, here in Denmark. I have been sexton here, man 
and
boy
    thirty years.
  Ham. How long will a man lie i' th' earth ere he rot?
  Clown. Faith
, if 'a be not rotten before 'a die (as we have
many
    pocky corses now-a-days that will scarce 
hold the laying in,
I
    will last you some eight year or nine year. A tanner will
last
    you
 nine year.
  Ham. Why he more than another?
  Clown. Why, sir, his hide is so tann'd with his tra
de that 'a
will
    keep out water a great while; and your water is a sore
decayer of
    your w
horeson dead body. Here's a skull now. This skull hath
lien
    you i' th' earth three-and-twenty 
years.
  Ham. Whose was it?
  Clown. A whoreson, mad fellow's it was. Whose do you think it
was?

  Ham. Nay, I know not.
  Clown. A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! 'A pour'd a flagon
of
    
Rhenish on my head once. This same skull, sir, was Yorick's
    skull, the King's jester.
  Ham. T
his?
  Clown. E'en that.
  Ham. Let me see. [Takes the skull.] Alas, poor Yorick! I knew
him,
  
  Horatio. A fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy.
He
    hath borne me on his back a 
thousand times. And now how
abhorred
    in my imagination it is! My gorge rises at it. Here hung

those
    lips that I have kiss'd I know not how oft. Where be your
gibes
    now? your gambols?
 your songs? your flashes of merriment that
    were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, 
to mock
your
    own grinning? Quite chap- fall'n? Now get you to my lady's
    chamber, and tell
 her, let her paint an inch thick, to this
    favour she must come. Make her laugh at that. Prithe
e,
Horatio,
    tell me one thing.
  Hor. What's that, my lord?
  Ham. Dost thou think Alexander
 look'd o' this fashion i' th'
earth?
  Hor. E'en so.
  Ham. And smelt so? Pah!
                
                          [Puts down the skull.]
  Hor. E'en so, my lord.
  Ham. To what base uses
 we may return, Horatio! Why may not
    imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find
 it
    stopping a bunghole?
  Hor. 'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.
  Ham. No, 
faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with
modesty
    enough, and likelihood to lead it; as
 thus: Alexander died,
    Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust
is
    e
arth; of earth we make loam; and why of that loam (whereto
he
    was converted) might they not st
op a beer barrel?
    Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
    Might stop a hole to keep the
 wind away.
    O, that that earth which kept the world in awe
    Should patch a wall t' expel th
e winter's flaw!
    But soft! but soft! aside! Here comes the King-

    Enter [priests with] a 
coffin [in funeral procession], King,
             Queen, Laertes, with Lords attendant.]

    Th
e Queen, the courtiers. Who is this they follow?
    And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken

    The corse they follow did with desp'rate hand
    Fordo it own life. 'Twas of some estate.
  
  Couch we awhile, and mark.
                                         [Retires with Horatio.]

  
Laer. What ceremony else?
  Ham. That is Laertes,
    A very noble youth. Mark.
  Laer. What cere
mony else?
  Priest. Her obsequies have been as far enlarg'd
    As we have warranty. Her death wa
s doubtful;
    And, but that great command o'ersways the order,
    She should in ground unsancti
fied have lodg'd
    Till the last trumpet. For charitable prayers,
    Shards, flints, and pebble
s should be thrown on her.
    Yet here she is allow'd her virgin rites,
    Her maiden strewments
, and the bringing home
    Of bell and burial.
  Laer. Must there no more be done?
  Priest. No 
more be done.
    We should profane the service of the dead
    To sing a requiem and such rest to
 her
    As to peace-parted souls.
  Laer. Lay her i' th' earth;
    And from her fair and unpoll
uted flesh
    May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,
    A minist'ring angel shall my 
sister be
    When thou liest howling.
  Ham. What, the fair Ophelia?
  Queen. Sweets to the swee
t! Farewell.
                                             [Scatters flowers.]
    I hop'd thou sho
uldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
    I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
    And 
not have strew'd thy grave.
  Laer. O, treble woe
    Fall ten times treble on that cursed head
 
   Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
    Depriv'd thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,
   
 Till I have caught her once more in mine arms.
                                             Leaps 
in the grave.
    Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead
    Till of this flat a mountain you 
have made
    T' o'ertop old Pelion or the skyish head
    Of blue Olympus.
  Ham. [comes forward
] What is he whose grief
    Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow
    Conjures the wand'
ring stars, and makes them stand
    Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,
    Hamlet the Dane. 
                   [Leaps in after Laertes.
  Laer. The devil take thy soul!
                     
                       [Grapples with him].
  Ham. Thou pray'st not well.
    I prithee take thy f
ingers from my throat;
    For, though I am not splenitive and rash,
    Yet have I in me somethin
g dangerous,
    Which let thy wisdom fear. Hold off thy hand!
  King. Pluck them asunder.
  Quee
n. Hamlet, Hamlet!
  All. Gentlemen!
  Hor. Good my lord, be quiet.
             [The Attendants 
part them, and they come out of the
                                                         grave.
]
  Ham. Why, I will fight with him upon this theme
    Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
  Qu
een. O my son, what theme?
  Ham. I lov'd Ophelia. Forty thousand brothers
    Could not (with all
 their quantity of love)
    Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?
  King. O, he is mad, Laer
tes.
  Queen. For love of God, forbear him!
  Ham. 'Swounds, show me what thou't do.
    Woo't we
ep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?
    Woo't drink up esill? eat a crocodile?
    I'
ll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?
    To outface me with leaping in her grave?
    Be buried 
quick with her, and so will I.
    And if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
    Millions of 
acres on us, till our ground,
    Singeing his pate against the burning zone,
    Make Ossa like a
 wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
    I'll rant as well as thou.
  Queen. This is mere madness;
    A
nd thus a while the fit will work on him.
    Anon, as patient as the female dove
    When that he
r golden couplets are disclos'd,
    His silence will sit drooping.
  Ham. Hear you, sir!
    Wha
t is the reason that you use me thus?
    I lov'd you ever. But it is no matter.
    Let Hercules 
himself do what he may,
    The cat will mew, and dog will have his day.
Exit.
  King. I pray the
e, good Horatio, wait upon him.
                                                   Exit Horatio.
 
   [To Laertes] Strengthen your patience in our last night's
speech.
    We'll put the matter to t
he present push.-
    Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.-
    This grave shall have a li
ving monument.
    An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
    Till then in patience our proceeding
 be.
                                                         Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore.
 A hall in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet and Horatio.

  Ham. So much for this, sir; now shall you s
ee the other.
    You do remember all the circumstance?
  Hor. Remember it, my lord!
  Ham. Sir, 
in my heart there was a kind of fighting
    That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay
    Wors
e than the mutinies in the bilboes. Rashly-
    And prais'd be rashness for it; let us know,
    O
ur indiscretion sometime serves us well
    When our deep plots do pall; and that should learn us

    There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
    Rough-hew them how we will-
  Hor. That is most c
ertain.
  Ham. Up from my cabin,
    My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
    Grop'd I to fi
nd out them; had my desire,
    Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew
    To mine own room a
gain; making so bold
    (My fears forgetting manners) to unseal
    Their grand commission; where
 I found, Horatio
    (O royal knavery!), an exact command,
    Larded with many several sorts of 
reasons,
    Importing Denmark's health, and England's too,
    With, hoo! such bugs and goblins i
n my life-
    That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
    No, not to stay the finding of the ax
e,
    My head should be struck off.
  Hor. Is't possible?
  Ham. Here's the commission; read it 
at more leisure.
    But wilt thou bear me how I did proceed?
  Hor. I beseech you.
  Ham. Being 
thus benetted round with villanies,
    Or I could make a prologue to my brains,
    They had begu
n the play. I sat me down;
    Devis'd a new commission; wrote it fair.
    I once did hold it, as
 our statists do,
    A baseness to write fair, and labour'd much
    How to forget that learning;
 but, sir, now
    It did me yeoman's service. Wilt thou know
    Th' effect of what I wrote?
  H
or. Ay, good my lord.
  Ham. An earnest conjuration from the King,
    As England was his faithful
 tributary,
    As love between them like the palm might flourish,
    As peace should still her w
heaten garland wear
    And stand a comma 'tween their amities,
    And many such-like as's of gre
at charge,
    That, on the view and knowing of these contents,
    Without debatement further, mo
re or less,
    He should the bearers put to sudden death,
    Not shriving time allow'd.
  Hor. 
How was this seal'd?
  Ham. Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
    I had my father's signet in
 my purse,
    Which was the model of that Danish seal;
    Folded the writ up in the form of th' 
other,
    Subscrib'd it, gave't th' impression, plac'd it safely,
    The changeling never known.
 Now, the next day
    Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent
    Thou know'st already.

  Hor. So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.
  Ham. Why, man, they did make love to this employm
ent!
    They are not near my conscience; their defeat
    Does by their own insinuation grow.
  
  'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
    Between the pass and fell incensed points
    Of 
mighty opposites.
  Hor. Why, what a king is this!
  Ham. Does it not, thinks't thee, stand me now
 upon-
    He that hath kill'd my king, and whor'd my mother;
    Popp'd in between th' election a
nd my hopes;
    Thrown out his angle for my proper life,
    And with such coz'nage- is't not per
fect conscience
    To quit him with this arm? And is't not to be damn'd
    To let this canker of
 our nature come
    In further evil?
  Hor. It must be shortly known to him from England
    Wha
t is the issue of the business there.
  Ham. It will be short; the interim is mine,
    And a man'
s life is no more than to say 'one.'
    But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
    That to Laertes I 
forgot myself,
    For by the image of my cause I see
    The portraiture of his. I'll court his f
avours.
    But sure the bravery of his grief did put me
    Into a tow'ring passion.
  Hor. Peac
e! Who comes here?

                 Enter young Osric, a courtier.

  Osr. Your lordship is rig
ht welcome back to Denmark.
  Ham. I humbly thank you, sir. [Aside to Horatio] Dost know this
    
waterfly?
  Hor. [aside to Hamlet] No, my good lord.
  Ham. [aside to Horatio] Thy state is the mo
re gracious; for
'tis a
    vice to know him. He hath much land, and fertile. Let a beast
be
   
 lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at the king's mess.
'Tis
    a chough; but, as I say, sp
acious in the possession of dirt.

  Osr. Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should

impart
    a thing to you from his Majesty.
  Ham. I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of s
pirit. Put
your
    bonnet to his right use. 'Tis for the head.
  Osr. I thank your lordship, it 
is very hot.
  Ham. No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly.
  Osr. It is indifferen
t cold, my lord, indeed.
  Ham. But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my
complexion.
  O
sr. Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry, as 'twere- I
cannot
    tell how. But, my lord, his M
ajesty bade me signify to you
that
    he has laid a great wager on your head. Sir, this is the
m
atter-
  Ham. I beseech you remember.
                           [Hamlet moves him to put on his h
at.]
  Osr. Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here
is
    newly come to court
 Laertes; believe me, an absolute
gentleman,
    full of most excellent differences, of very soft 
society and
    great showing. Indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the
card
    or calendar 
of gentry; for you shall find in him the
continent of
    what part a gentleman would see.
  Ham.
 Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you; though, I

    know, to divide him inventorially
 would dozy th' arithmetic
of
    memory, and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail.
 
   But, in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of
great
    article, and his infusion
 of such dearth and rareness as, to
make
    true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror, and
 who
else
    would trace him, his umbrage, nothing more.
  Osr. Your lordship speaks most infall
ibly of him.
  Ham. The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our
more
    rawer brea
th?
  Osr. Sir?
  Hor [aside to Hamlet] Is't not possible to understand in
another
    tongue? Y
ou will do't, sir, really.
  Ham. What imports the nomination of this gentleman?
  Osr. Of Laertes
?
  Hor. [aside] His purse is empty already. All's golden words are
    spent.
  Ham. Of him, sir
.
  Osr. I know you are not ignorant-
  Ham. I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it w
ould
not
    much approve me. Well, sir?
  Osr. You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes i
s-
  Ham. I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in
    excellence; but to know a
 man well were to know himself.
  Osr. I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on

him
    by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.
  Ham. What's his weapon?
  Osr. Rapier and dagger.

  Ham. That's two of his weapons- but well.
  Osr. The King, sir, hath wager'd with him six Barba
ry horses;
    against the which he has impon'd, as I take it, six French
    rapiers and poniards
, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers,
and
    so. Three of the carriages, in faith, are very d
ear to fancy,
    very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of
    very liberal c
onceit.
  Ham. What call you the carriages?
  Hor. [aside to Hamlet] I knew you must be edified by
 the
margent
    ere you had done.
  Osr. The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
  Ham. The phrase
 would be more germane to the matter if we could
    carry cannon by our sides. I would it might be
 hangers till
then.
    But on! Six Barbary horses against six French swords, their
    assigns, 
and three liberal-conceited carriages: that's the
French
    bet against the Danish. Why is this a
ll impon'd, as you call
it?
  Osr. The King, sir, hath laid that, in a dozen passes between
    y
ourself and him, he shall not exceed you three hits; he hath
    laid on twelve for nine, and it wo
uld come to immediate trial
    if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.
  Ham. How if I answe
r no?
  Osr. I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
  Ham. Sir, I will walk here
 in the hall. If it please his
Majesty,
    it is the breathing time of day with me. Let the foils
 be
    brought, the gentleman willing, and the King hold his
purpose,
    I will win for him if 
I can; if not, I will gain nothing but
my
    shame and the odd hits.
  Osr. Shall I redeliver yo
u e'en so?
  Ham. To this effect, sir, after what flourish your nature will.
  Osr. I commend my d
uty to your lordship.
  Ham. Yours, yours. [Exit Osric.] He does well to commend it
    himself; t
here are no tongues else for's turn.
  Hor. This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.
  H
am. He did comply with his dug before he suck'd it. Thus has
he,
    and many more of the same bev
y that I know the drossy age
dotes
    on, only got the tune of the time and outward habit of
enc
ounter-
    a kind of yesty collection, which carries them through and
    through the most fann'd
 and winnowed opinions; and do but
blow
    them to their trial-the bubbles are out,

          
                  Enter a Lord.

  Lord. My lord, his Majesty commended him to you by young Osric,

who
    brings back to him, that you attend him in the hall. He sends
to
    know if your pleas
ure hold to play with Laertes, or that you
will
    take longer time.
  Ham. I am constant to my 
purposes; they follow the King's
pleasure.
    If his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or whenso
ever,
provided
    I be so able as now.
  Lord. The King and Queen and all are coming down.
  Ha
m. In happy time.
  Lord. The Queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to
    Laertes be
fore you fall to play.
  Ham. She well instructs me.
                                             
       [Exit Lord.]
  Hor. You will lose this wager, my lord.
  Ham. I do not think so. Since he w
ent into France I have been
in
    continual practice. I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst

not
    think how ill all's here about my heart. But it is no matter.
  Hor. Nay, good my lord -

  Ham. It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gaingiving as
    would perhaps trouble a woman.

  Hor. If your mind dislike anything, obey it. I will forestall
their
    repair hither and say 
you are not fit.
  Ham. Not a whit, we defy augury; there's a special providence
in
    the fall 
of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not to come; if it
be
    not to come, it will be now; if it be n
ot now, yet it will
come:
    the readiness is all. Since no man knows aught of what he
leaves,

    what is't to leave betimes? Let be.

    Enter King, Queen, Laertes, Osric, and Lords, with ot
her
              Attendants with foils and gauntlets.
               A table and flagons of wine 
on it.

  King. Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
                    [The King put
s Laertes' hand into Hamlet's.]
  Ham. Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong;
    But pa
rdon't, as you are a gentleman.
    This presence knows,
    And you must needs have heard, how I 
am punish'd
    With sore distraction. What I have done
    That might your nature, honour, and ex
ception
    Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
    Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Ha
mlet.
    If Hamlet from himself be taken away,
    And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,

    Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
    Who does it, then? His madness. If't be so,
  
  Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
    His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
    Sir, in th
is audience,
    Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd evil
    Free me so far in your most generous 
thoughts
    That I have shot my arrow o'er the house
    And hurt my brother.
  Laer. I am satis
fied in nature,
    Whose motive in this case should stir me most
    To my revenge. But in my ter
ms of honour
    I stand aloof, and will no reconcilement
    Till by some elder masters of known 
honour
    I have a voice and precedent of peace
    To keep my name ungor'd. But till that time

    I do receive your offer'd love like love,
    And will not wrong it.
  Ham. I embrace it freel
y,
    And will this brother's wager frankly play.
    Give us the foils. Come on.
  Laer. Come, 
one for me.
  Ham. I'll be your foil, Laertes. In mine ignorance
    Your skill shall, like a star
 i' th' darkest night,
    Stick fiery off indeed.
  Laer. You mock me, sir.
  Ham. No, by this h
and.
  King. Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
    You know the wager?
  Ham. Very
 well, my lord.
    Your Grace has laid the odds o' th' weaker side.
  King. I do not fear it, I h
ave seen you both;
    But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.
  Laer. This is too heavy
; let me see another.
  Ham. This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
                  
                              Prepare to play.
  Osr. Ay, my good lord.
  King. Set me the stoups 
of wine upon that table.
    If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
    Or quit in answer of the 
third exchange,
    Let all the battlements their ordnance fire;
    The King shall drink to Hamle
t's better breath,
    And in the cup an union shall he throw
    Richer than that which four succ
essive kings
    In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;
    And let the kettle to the tru
mpet speak,
    The trumpet to the cannoneer without,
    The cannons to the heavens, the heaven t
o earth,
    'Now the King drinks to Hamlet.' Come, begin.
    And you the judges, bear a wary eye
.
  Ham. Come on, sir.
  Laer. Come, my lord.                                They play.
  Ham. On
e.
  Laer. No.
  Ham. Judgment!
  Osr. A hit, a very palpable hit.
  Laer. Well, again!
  King.
 Stay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
    Here's to thy health.
               [Drum;
 trumpets sound; a piece goes off [within].
    Give him the cup.
  Ham. I'll play this bout first
; set it by awhile.
    Come. (They play.) Another hit. What say you?
  Laer. A touch, a touch; I 
do confess't.
  King. Our son shall win.
  Queen. He's fat, and scant of breath.
    Here, Hamlet
, take my napkin, rub thy brows.
    The Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
  Ham. Good madam!

  King. Gertrude, do not drink.
  Queen. I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.          Drinks.

  King. [aside] It is the poison'd cup; it is too late.
  Ham. I dare not drink yet, madam; by-and
-by.
  Queen. Come, let me wipe thy face.
  Laer. My lord, I'll hit him now.
  King. I do not thi
nk't.
  Laer. [aside] And yet it is almost against my conscience.
  Ham. Come for the third, Laert
es! You but dally.
    Pray you pass with your best violence;
    I am afeard you make a wanton of
 me.
  Laer. Say you so? Come on.                               Play.
  Osr. Nothing neither way.

  Laer. Have at you now!
                [Laertes wounds Hamlet; then] in scuffling, they
       
             change rapiers, [and Hamlet wounds Laertes].
  King. Part them! They are incens'd.
  
Ham. Nay come! again!                         The Queen falls.

  Osr. Look to the Queen there, ho
!
  Hor. They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?
  Osr. How is't, Laertes?
  Laer. Why, as 
a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric.
    I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.
  Ham. How 
does the Queen?
  King. She sounds to see them bleed.
  Queen. No, no! the drink, the drink! O my 
dear Hamlet!
    The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.                 [Dies.]
  Ham. O villany! Ho
! let the door be lock'd.
    Treachery! Seek it out.
                                            
    [Laertes falls.]
  Laer. It is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain;
    No medicine in the wo
rld can do thee good.
    In thee there is not half an hour of life.
    The treacherous instrumen
t is in thy hand,
    Unbated and envenom'd. The foul practice
    Hath turn'd itself on me. Lo, h
ere I lie,
    Never to rise again. Thy mother's poison'd.
    I can no more. The King, the King's
 to blame.
  Ham. The point envenom'd too?
    Then, venom, to thy work.                    Hurts 
the King.
  All. Treason! treason!
  King. O, yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt.
  Ham. Here,
 thou incestuous, murd'rous, damned Dane,
    Drink off this potion! Is thy union here?
    Follow
 my mother.                                 King dies.
  Laer. He is justly serv'd.
    It is a po
ison temper'd by himself.
    Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet.
    Mine and my father's
 death come not upon thee,
    Nor thine on me!                                       Dies.
  Ham.
 Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.
    I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!
    Yo
u that look pale and tremble at this chance,
    That are but mutes or audience to this act,
    H
ad I but time (as this fell sergeant, Death,
    Is strict in his arrest) O, I could tell you-
   
 But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;
    Thou liv'st; report me and my cause aright
    To the unsa
tisfied.
  Hor. Never believe it.
    I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.
    Here's yet some
 liquor left.
  Ham. As th'art a man,
    Give me the cup. Let go! By heaven, I'll ha't.
    O go
od Horatio, what a wounded name
    (Things standing thus unknown) shall live behind me!
    If th
ou didst ever hold me in thy heart,
    Absent thee from felicity awhile,
    And in this harsh wo
rld draw thy breath in pain,
    To tell my story.         [March afar off, and shot within.]
    
What warlike noise is this?
  Osr. Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
    To the am
bassadors of England gives
    This warlike volley.
  Ham. O, I die, Horatio!
    The potent pois
on quite o'ercrows my spirit.
    I cannot live to hear the news from England,
    But I do prophe
sy th' election lights
    On Fortinbras. He has my dying voice.
    So tell him, with th' occurre
nts, more and less,
    Which have solicited- the rest is silence.             Dies.
  Hor. Now cr
acks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince,
    And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
   
                                              [March within.]
    Why does the drum come hither?


    Enter Fortinbras and English Ambassadors, with Drum,
                  Colours, and Attendants
.

  Fort. Where is this sight?
  Hor. What is it you will see?
    If aught of woe or wonder, c
ease your search.
  Fort. This quarry cries on havoc. O proud Death,
    What feast is toward in t
hine eternal cell
    That thou so many princes at a shot
    So bloodily hast struck.
  Ambassad
or. The sight is dismal;
    And our affairs from England come too late.
    The ears are senseles
s that should give us hearing
    To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd
    That Rosencrantz an
d Guildenstern are dead.
    Where should we have our thanks?
  Hor. Not from his mouth,
    Had 
it th' ability of life to thank you.
    He never gave commandment for their death.
    But since,
 so jump upon this bloody question,
    You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
    Are he
re arriv'd, give order that these bodies
    High on a stage be placed to the view;
    And let me
 speak to the yet unknowing world
    How these things came about. So shall you hear
    Of carnal
, bloody and unnatural acts;
    Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters;
    Of deaths put on 
by cunning and forc'd cause;
    And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
    Fall'n on th' inventors
' heads. All this can I
    Truly deliver.
  Fort. Let us haste to hear it,
    And call the nobl
est to the audience.
    For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.
    I have some rights of memor
y in this kingdom
    Which now, to claim my vantage doth invite me.
  Hor. Of that I shall have a
lso cause to speak,
    And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more.
    But let this same be
 presently perform'd,
    Even while men's minds are wild, lest more mischance
    On plots and er
rors happen.
  Fort. Let four captains
    Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage;
    For he wa
s likely, had he been put on,
    To have prov'd most royally; and for his passage
    The soldier
s' music and the rites of war
    Speak loudly for him.
    Take up the bodies. Such a sight as th
is
    Becomes the field but here shows much amiss.
    Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
            E
xeunt marching; after the which a peal of ordnance
                                                
   are shot off.

ACT I. Scene I.
Elsinore.
 A platform before the Castle.

Enter two Sentinels-[first,] Francisco, [who paces up and down
at
 his post; then] Bernardo, [who approaches him].

  Ber. Who's there?
  Fran. Nay, answer me. Sta
nd and unfold yourself.
  Ber. Long live the King!
  Fran. Bernardo?
  Ber. He.
  Fran. You come
 most carefully upon your hour.
  Ber. 'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.
  Fran.
 For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold,
    And I am sick at heart.
  Ber. Have you had qu
iet guard?
  Fran. Not a mouse stirring.
  Ber. Well, good night.
    If you do meet Horatio and 
Marcellus,
    The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.

                    Enter Horatio an
d Marcellus.

  Fran. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?
  Hor. Friends to this ground
.
  Mar. And liegemen to the Dane.
  Fran. Give you good night.
  Mar. O, farewell, honest soldie
r.
    Who hath reliev'd you?
  Fran. Bernardo hath my place.
    Give you good night.           
                        Exit.
  Mar. Holla, Bernardo!
  Ber. Say-
    What, is Horatio there ?
 
 Hor. A piece of him.
  Ber. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.
  Mar. What, has this thin
g appear'd again to-night?
  Ber. I have seen nothing.
  Mar. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,

    And will not let belief take hold of him
    Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.
  
  Therefore I have entreated him along,
    With us to watch the minutes of this night,
    That, 
if again this apparition come,
    He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
  Hor. Tush, tush, 'tw
ill not appear.
  Ber. Sit down awhile,
    And let us once again assail your ears,
    That are 
so fortified against our story,
    What we two nights have seen.
  Hor. Well, sit we down,
    A
nd let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
  Ber. Last night of all,
    When yond same star that's we
stward from the pole
    Had made his course t' illume that part of heaven
    Where now it burns,
 Marcellus and myself,
    The bell then beating one-

                        Enter Ghost.

  
Mar. Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!
  Ber. In the same figure, like the King tha
t's dead.
  Mar. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
  Ber. Looks it not like the King? Mark
 it, Horatio.
  Hor. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.
  Ber. It would be spoke to.

  Mar. Question it, Horatio.
  Hor. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night
    Together wi
th that fair and warlike form
    In which the majesty of buried Denmark
    Did sometimes march? 
By heaven I charge thee speak!
  Mar. It is offended.
  Ber. See, it stalks away!
  Hor. Stay! Sp
eak, speak! I charge thee speak!
                                                     Exit Ghost.

  Mar. 'Tis gone and will not answer.
  Ber. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale.
    Is n
ot this something more than fantasy?
    What think you on't?
  Hor. Before my God, I might not th
is believe
    Without the sensible and true avouch
    Of mine own eyes.
  Mar. Is it not like t
he King?
  Hor. As thou art to thyself.
    Such was the very armour he had on
    When he th' am
bitious Norway combated.
    So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,
    He smote the sledded 
Polacks on the ice.
    'Tis strange.
  Mar. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
    W
ith martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
  Hor. In what particular thought to work I know not;

    But, in the gross and scope of my opinion,
    This bodes some strange eruption to our state.

  Mar. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows,
    Why this same strict and most observant 
watch
    So nightly toils the subject of the land,
    And why such daily cast of brazen cannon

    And foreign mart for implements of war;
    Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
 
   Does not divide the Sunday from the week.
    What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
    
Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day?
    Who is't that can inform me?
  Hor. That can 
I.
    At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
    Whose image even but now appear'd to us,

    Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
    Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
  
  Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet
    (For so this side of our known world esteem'
d him)
    Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,
    Well ratified by law and herald
ry,
    Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
    Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqu
eror;
    Against the which a moiety competent
    Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
    
To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
    Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant
    And car
riage of the article design'd,
    His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
    Of unimprov
ed mettle hot and full,
    Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,
    Shark'd up a list of
 lawless resolutes,
    For food and diet, to some enterprise
    That hath a stomach in't; which 
is no other,
    As it doth well appear unto our state,
    But to recover of us, by strong hand

    And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
    So by his father lost; and this, I take it,
 
   Is the main motive of our preparations,
    The source of this our watch, and the chief head
  
  Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
  Ber. I think it be no other but e'en so.
    Well m
ay it sort that this portentous figure
    Comes armed through our watch, so like the King
    Tha
t was and is the question of these wars.
  Hor. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
    In the
 most high and palmy state of Rome,
    A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
    The graves sto
od tenantless, and the sheeted dead
    Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;
    As stars w
ith trains of fire, and dews of blood,
    Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
    Upon whose
 influence Neptune's empire stands
    Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.
    And even the 
like precurse of fierce events,
    As harbingers preceding still the fates
    And prologue to th
e omen coming on,
    Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
    Unto our climature and count
rymen.

                      Enter Ghost again.

    But soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again
!
    I'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!
                                         
      Spreads his arms.
    If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
    Speak to me.
    If ther
e be any good thing to be done,
    That may to thee do ease, and, race to me,
    Speak to me.
 
   If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
    Which happily foreknowing may avoid,
    O, speak!

    Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
    Extorted treasure in the womb of earth
    (For wh
ich, they say, you spirits oft walk in death),
                                                 The
 cock crows.
    Speak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!
  Mar. Shall I strike at it wi
th my partisan?
  Hor. Do, if it will not stand.
  Ber. 'Tis here!
  Hor. 'Tis here!
  Mar. 'Tis
 gone!
                                                     Exit Ghost.
    We do it wrong, being 
so majestical,
    To offer it the show of violence;
    For it is as the air, invulnerable,
    
And our vain blows malicious mockery.
  Ber. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
  Hor. And
 then it started, like a guilty thing
    Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
    The cock, that 
is the trumpet to the morn,
    Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
    Awake the god o
f day; and at his warning,
    Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
    Th' extravagant and er
ring spirit hies
    To his confine; and of the truth herein
    This present object made probatio
n.
  Mar. It faded on the crowing of the cock.
    Some say that ever, 'gainst that season comes

    Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
    The bird of dawning singeth all night long;
   
 And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,
    The nights are wholesome, then no planets stri
ke,
    No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
    So hallow'd and so gracious is the time
.
  Hor. So have I heard and do in part believe it.
    But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,

    Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.
    Break we our watch up; and by my advice
  
  Let us impart what we have seen to-night
    Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
    This spir
it, dumb to us, will speak to him.
    Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
    As needfu
l in our loves, fitting our duty?
    Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
    Where we sha
ll find him most conveniently.           Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A room of state in th
e Castle.

Flourish. [Enter Claudius, King of Denmark, Gertrude the Queen,
Hamlet,
Polonius, Lae
rtes and his sister Ophelia, [Voltemand, Cornelius,]
Lords Attendant.

  King. Though yet of Haml
et our dear brother's death
    The memory be green, and that it us befitted
    To bear our heart
s in grief, and our whole kingdom
    To be contracted in one brow of woe,
    Yet so far hath dis
cretion fought with nature
    That we with wisest sorrow think on him
    Together with remembran
ce of ourselves.
    Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
    Th' imperial jointress to t
his warlike state,
    Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,
    With an auspicious, and a dropp
ing eye,
    With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,
    In equal scale weighing deligh
t and dole,
    Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd
    Your better wisdoms, which have freel
y gone
    With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
    Now follows, that you know, young Fort
inbras,
    Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
    Or thinking by our late dear brother's death

    Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
    Colleagued with this dream of his advantage,

    He hath not fail'd to pester us with message
    Importing the surrender of those lands
    Lo
st by his father, with all bands of law,
    To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
    Now
 for ourself and for this time of meeting.
    Thus much the business is: we have here writ
    To
 Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,
    Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears
    Of this his n
ephew's purpose, to suppress
    His further gait herein, in that the levies,
    The lists, and f
ull proportions are all made
    Out of his subject; and we here dispatch
    You, good Cornelius,
 and you, Voltemand,
    For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,
    Giving to you no further 
personal power
    To business with the King, more than the scope
    Of these dilated articles al
low.            [Gives a paper.]
    Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
  Cor., Volt.
 In that, and all things, will we show our duty.
  King. We doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell.
 
                                Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius.
    And now, Laertes, what's the ne
ws with you?
    You told us of some suit. What is't, Laertes?
    You cannot speak of reason to t
he Dane
    And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
    That shall not be my offer, n
ot thy asking?
    The head is not more native to the heart,
    The hand more instrumental to the
 mouth,
    Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
    What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
  L
aer. My dread lord,
    Your leave and favour to return to France;
    From whence though willingl
y I came to Denmark
    To show my duty in your coronation,
    Yet now I must confess, that duty 
done,
    My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
    And bow them to your gracious leave 
and pardon.
  King. Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
  Pol. He hath, my lord, wru
ng from me my slow leave
    By laboursome petition, and at last
    Upon his will I seal'd my har
d consent.
    I do beseech you give him leave to go.
  King. Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be
 thine,
    And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
    But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son-

  Ham. [aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind!
  King. How is it that the clouds still 
hang on you?
  Ham. Not so, my lord. I am too much i' th' sun.
  Queen. Good Hamlet, cast thy nigh
ted colour off,
    And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
    Do not for ever with thy 
vailed lids
    Seek for thy noble father in the dust.
    Thou know'st 'tis common. All that live
s must die,
    Passing through nature to eternity.
  Ham. Ay, madam, it is common.
  Queen. If i
t be,
    Why seems it so particular with thee?
  Ham. Seems, madam, Nay, it is. I know not 'seems
.'
    'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
    Nor customary suits of solemn black,
    No
r windy suspiration of forc'd breath,
    No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
    Nor the dejec
ted havior of the visage,
    Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
    'That can denot
e me truly. These indeed seem,
    For they are actions that a man might play;
    But I have that
 within which passeth show-
    These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
  King. 'Tis sweet a
nd commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
    To give these mourning duties to your father;
    But y
ou must know, your father lost a father;
    That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
  
  In filial obligation for some term
    To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever
    In obstinate
 condolement is a course
    Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief;
    It shows a will most
 incorrect to heaven,
    A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
    An understanding simple and u
nschool'd;
    For what we know must be, and is as common
    As any the most vulgar thing to sens
e,
    Why should we in our peevish opposition
    Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,

    A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
    To reason most absurd, whose common theme
  
  Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
    From the first corse till he that died to-day,

    'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth
    This unprevailing woe, and think of us
   
 As of a father; for let the world take note
    You are the most immediate to our throne,
    And
 with no less nobility of love
    Than that which dearest father bears his son
    Do I impart to
ward you. For your intent
    In going back to school in Wittenberg,
    It is most retrograde to 
our desire;
    And we beseech you, bend you to remain
    Here in the cheer and comfort of our ey
e,
    Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
  Queen. Let not thy mother lose her prayers, H
amlet.
    I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.
  Ham. I shall in all my best obey you,
 madam.
  King. Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.
    Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come.
 
   This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet
    Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,
    N
o jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day
    But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
    
And the King's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,
    Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.
    
                            Flourish. Exeunt all but Hamlet.
  Ham. O that this too too solid flesh
 would melt,
    Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!
    Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
 
   His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
    How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
    
Seem to me all the uses of this world!
    Fie on't! ah, fie! 'Tis an unweeded garden
    That gro
ws to seed; things rank and gross in nature
    Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
  
  But two months dead! Nay, not so much, not two.
    So excellent a king, that was to this
    Hy
perion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
    That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
    Vis
it her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
    Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him
    As 
if increase of appetite had grown
    By what it fed on; and yet, within a month-
    Let me not t
hink on't! Frailty, thy name is woman!-
    A little month, or ere those shoes were old
    With w
hich she followed my poor father's body
    Like Niobe, all tears- why she, even she
    (O God! a
 beast that wants discourse of reason
    Would have mourn'd longer) married with my uncle;
    My
 father's brother, but no more like my father
    Than I to Hercules. Within a month,
    Ere yet 
the salt of most unrighteous tears
    Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
    She married. 
O, most wicked speed, to post
    With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
    It is not, nor it 
cannot come to good.
    But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue!

          Enter Horatio,
 Marcellus, and Bernardo.

  Hor. Hail to your lordship!
  Ham. I am glad to see you well.
    H
oratio!- or I do forget myself.
  Hor. The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
  Ham. Sir, 
my good friend- I'll change that name with you.
    And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?
  
  Marcellus?
  Mar. My good lord!
  Ham. I am very glad to see you.- [To Bernardo] Good even, sir.
-

    But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
  Hor. A truant disposition, good my lord.

  Ham. I would not hear your enemy say so,
    Nor shall you do my ear that violence
    To make i
t truster of your own report
    Against yourself. I know you are no truant.
    But what is your 
affair in Elsinore?
    We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
  Hor. My lord, I came to se
e your father's funeral.
  Ham. I prithee do not mock me, fellow student.
    I think it was to se
e my mother's wedding.
  Hor. Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.
  Ham. Thrift, thrift, Horat
io! The funeral bak'd meats
    Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
    Would I had met 
my dearest foe in heaven
    Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
    My father- methinks I see m
y father.
  Hor. O, where, my lord?
  Ham. In my mind's eye, Horatio.
  Hor. I saw him once. He w
as a goodly king.
  Ham. He was a man, take him for all in all.
    I shall not look upon his like
 again.
  Hor. My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
  Ham. Saw? who?
  Hor. My lord, the King 
your father.
  Ham. The King my father?
  Hor. Season your admiration for a while
    With an att
ent ear, till I may deliver
    Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
    This marvel to you.
  Ha
m. For God's love let me hear!
  Hor. Two nights together had these gentlemen
    (Marcellus and B
ernardo) on their watch
    In the dead vast and middle of the night
    Been thus encount'red. A 
figure like your father,
    Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
    Appears before them and with so
lemn march
    Goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walk'd
    By their oppress'd and fear-sur
prised eyes,
    Within his truncheon's length; whilst they distill'd
    Almost to jelly with the
 act of fear,
    Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
    In dreadful secrecy impart they 
did,
    And I with them the third night kept the watch;
    Where, as they had deliver'd, both in
 time,
    Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
    The apparition comes. I knew your 
father.
    These hands are not more like.
  Ham. But where was this?
  Mar. My lord, upon the pl
atform where we watch'd.
  Ham. Did you not speak to it?
  Hor. My lord, I did;
    But answer ma
de it none. Yet once methought
    It lifted up it head and did address
    Itself to motion, like
 as it would speak;
    But even then the morning cock crew loud,
    And at the sound it shrunk i
n haste away
    And vanish'd from our sight.
  Ham. 'Tis very strange.
  Hor. As I do live, my h
onour'd lord, 'tis true;
    And we did think it writ down in our duty
    To let you know of it.

  Ham. Indeed, indeed, sirs. But this troubles me.
    Hold you the watch to-night?
  Both [Mar. 
and Ber.] We do, my lord.
  Ham. Arm'd, say you?
  Both. Arm'd, my lord.
  Ham. From top to toe?

  Both. My lord, from head to foot.
  Ham. Then saw you not his face?
  Hor. O, yes, my lord! He 
wore his beaver up.
  Ham. What, look'd he frowningly.
  Hor. A countenance more in sorrow than in
 anger.
  Ham. Pale or red?
  Hor. Nay, very pale.
  Ham. And fix'd his eyes upon you?
  Hor. Mo
st constantly.
  Ham. I would I had been there.
  Hor. It would have much amaz'd you.
  Ham. Very
 like, very like. Stay'd it long?
  Hor. While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
  Bot
h. Longer, longer.
  Hor. Not when I saw't.
  Ham. His beard was grizzled- no?
  Hor. It was, as 
I have seen it in his life,
    A sable silver'd.
  Ham. I will watch to-night.
    Perchance 'tw
ill walk again.
  Hor. I warr'nt it will.
  Ham. If it assume my noble father's person,
    I'll 
speak to it, though hell itself should gape
    And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
    If y
ou have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
    Let it be tenable in your silence still;
    And whatso
ever else shall hap to-night,
    Give it an understanding but no tongue.
    I will requite your 
loves. So, fare you well.
    Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
    I'll visit you.
  
All. Our duty to your honour.
  Ham. Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell.
                       
                 Exeunt [all but Hamlet].
    My father's spirit- in arms? All is not well.
    I 
doubt some foul play. Would the night were come!
    Till then sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will 
rise,
    Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
Exit.




Scene III.
Elsinore.
 A room in the house of Polonius.

Enter Laertes and Ophelia.

  Laer. My necessaries are embark
'd. Farewell.
    And, sister, as the winds give benefit
    And convoy is assistant, do not sleep
,
    But let me hear from you.
  Oph. Do you doubt that?
  Laer. For Hamlet, and the trifling of
 his favour,
    Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood;
    A violet in the youth of primy nature,

    Forward, not permanent- sweet, not lasting;
    The perfume and suppliance of a minute;
    
No more.
  Oph. No more but so?
  Laer. Think it no more.
    For nature crescent does not grow a
lone
    In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,
    The inward service of the mind and soul

    Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
    And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
   
 The virtue of his will; but you must fear,
    His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
  
  For he himself is subject to his birth.
    He may not, as unvalued persons do,
    Carve for hi
mself, for on his choice depends
    The safety and health of this whole state,
    And therefore 
must his choice be circumscrib'd
    Unto the voice and yielding of that body
    Whereof he is th
e head. Then if he says he loves you,
    It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
    As he in hi
s particular act and place
    May give his saying deed; which is no further
    Than the main voi
ce of Denmark goes withal.
    Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain
    If with too creden
t ear you list his songs,
    Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
    To his unmast'r
ed importunity.
    Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
    And keep you in the rear of you
r affection,
    Out of the shot and danger of desire.
    The chariest maid is prodigal enough
 
   If she unmask her beauty to the moon.
    Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes.
    The 
canker galls the infants of the spring
    Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd,
    And in t
he morn and liquid dew of youth
    Contagious blastments are most imminent.
    Be wary then; bes
t safety lies in fear.
    Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
  Oph. I shall th' effec
t of this good lesson keep
    As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
    Do not as some u
ngracious pastors do,
    Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven,
    Whiles, like a puff'd an
d reckless libertine,
    Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads
    And recks not his own 
rede.
  Laer. O, fear me not!

                       Enter Polonius.

    I stay too long. But
 here my father comes.
    A double blessing is a double grace;
    Occasion smiles upon a second 
leave.
  Pol. Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame!
    The wind sits in the shoulder of y
our sail,
    And you are stay'd for. There- my blessing with thee!
    And these few precepts in 
thy memory
    Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
    Nor any unproportion'd though
t his act.
    Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar:
    Those friends thou hast, and their ad
option tried,
    Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel;
    But do not dull thy palm wit
h entertainment
    Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware
    Of entrance to a quarrel; b
ut being in,
    Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee.
    Give every man thine ear, but few
 thy voice;
    Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
    Costly thy habit as thy pur
se can buy,
    But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
    For the apparel oft proclaims the
 man,
    And they in France of the best rank and station
    Are most select and generous, chief 
in that.
    Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
    For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
 
   And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
    This above all- to thine own self be true,
    A
nd it must follow, as the night the day,
    Thou canst not then be false to any man.
    Farewell
. My blessing season this in thee!
  Laer. Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
  Pol. The tim
e invites you. Go, your servants tend.
  Laer. Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well
    What I hav
e said to you.
  Oph. 'Tis in my memory lock'd,
    And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
  
Laer. Farewell.                                          Exit.
  Pol. What is't, Ophelia, he hath s
aid to you?
  Oph. So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
  Pol. Marry, well bethought
!
    'Tis told me he hath very oft of late
    Given private time to you, and you yourself
    H
ave of your audience been most free and bounteous.
    If it be so- as so 'tis put on me,
    And 
that in way of caution- I must tell you
    You do not understand yourself so clearly
    As it be
hooves my daughter and your honour.
    What is between you? Give me up the truth.
  Oph. He hath,
 my lord, of late made many tenders
    Of his affection to me.
  Pol. Affection? Pooh! You speak 
like a green girl,
    Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
    Do you believe his tenders, as 
you call them?
  Oph. I do not know, my lord, what I should think,
  Pol. Marry, I will teach you!
 Think yourself a baby
    That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
    Which are not sterl
ing. Tender yourself more dearly,
    Or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
    Running it
 thus) you'll tender me a fool.
  Oph. My lord, he hath importun'd me with love
    In honourable 
fashion.
  Pol. Ay, fashion you may call it. Go to, go to!
  Oph. And hath given countenance to hi
s speech, my lord,
    With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
  Pol. Ay, springes to catch woodc
ocks! I do know,
    When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
    Lends the tongue vows. These 
blazes, daughter,
    Giving more light than heat, extinct in both
    Even in their promise, as i
t is a-making,
    You must not take for fire. From this time
    Be something scanter of your mai
den presence.
    Set your entreatments at a higher rate
    Than a command to parley. For Lord Ha
mlet,
    Believe so much in him, that he is young,
    And with a larger tether may he walk
    
Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia,
    Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
    Not
 of that dye which their investments show,
    But mere implorators of unholy suits,
    Breathing
 like sanctified and pious bawds,
    The better to beguile. This is for all:
    I would not, in 
plain terms, from this time forth
    Have you so slander any moment leisure
    As to give words 
or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
    Look to't, I charge you. Come your ways.
  Oph. I shall obey, my
 lord.
                                                         Exeunt.




Scene IV.
Elsinor
e. The platform before the Castle.

Enter Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus.

  Ham. The air bites 
shrewdly; it is very cold.
  Hor. It is a nipping and an eager air.
  Ham. What hour now?
  Hor. 
I think it lacks of twelve.
  Mar. No, it is struck.
  Hor. Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws 
near the season
    Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
                   A flourish of tru
mpets, and two pieces go off.
    What does this mean, my lord?
  Ham. The King doth wake to-night
 and takes his rouse,
    Keeps wassail, and the swagg'ring upspring reels,
    And, as he drains 
his draughts of Rhenish down,
    The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out
    The triumph of his 
pledge.
  Hor. Is it a custom?
  Ham. Ay, marry, is't;
    But to my mind, though I am native her
e
    And to the manner born, it is a custom
    More honour'd in the breach than the observance.

    This heavy-headed revel east and west
    Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations;
    T
hey clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase
    Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
    From 
our achievements, though perform'd at height,
    The pith and marrow of our attribute.
    So oft
 it chances in particular men
    That, for some vicious mole of nature in them,
    As in their b
irth,- wherein they are not guilty,
    Since nature cannot choose his origin,-
    By the o'ergro
wth of some complexion,
    Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
    Or by some habit 
that too much o'erleavens
    The form of plausive manners, that these men
    Carrying, I say, th
e stamp of one defect,
    Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,
    Their virtues else- be th
ey as pure as grace,
    As infinite as man may undergo-
    Shall in the general censure take cor
ruption
    From that particular fault. The dram of e'il
    Doth all the noble substance often do
ut To his own scandal.

                         Enter Ghost.

  Hor. Look, my lord, it comes!

  Ham. Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
    Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
 
   Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
    Be thy intents wicked or charitable,

    Thou com'st in such a questionable shape
    That I will speak to thee. I'll call thee Hamlet,

    King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me?
    Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell
    Why t
hy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,
    Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre
    Wherei
n we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
    Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws
    To cast thee up aga
in. What may this mean
    That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,
    Revisits thus the g
limpses of the moon,
    Making night hideous, and we fools of nature
    So horridly to shake our
 disposition
    With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
    Say, why is this? wherefore? W
hat should we do?
                                           Ghost beckons Hamlet.
  Hor. It becko
ns you to go away with it,
    As if it some impartment did desire
    To you alone.
  Mar. Look 
with what courteous action
    It waves you to a more removed ground.
    But do not go with it!

  Hor. No, by no means!
  Ham. It will not speak. Then will I follow it.
  Hor. Do not, my lord!

  Ham. Why, what should be the fear?
    I do not set my life at a pin's fee;
    And for my soul,
 what can it do to that,
    Being a thing immortal as itself?
    It waves me forth again. I'll f
ollow it.
  Hor. What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
    Or to the dreadful summit of 
the cliff
    That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
    And there assume some other, horrible f
orm
    Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
    And draw you into madness? Think of it.

    The very place puts toys of desperation,
    Without more motive, into every brain
    That 
looks so many fadoms to the sea
    And hears it roar beneath.
  Ham. It waves me still.
    Go o
n. I'll follow thee.
  Mar. You shall not go, my lord.
  Ham. Hold off your hands!
  Hor. Be rul'
d. You shall not go.
  Ham. My fate cries out
    And makes each petty artire in this body
    As
 hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
                                                [Ghost beckons.]


    Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
    By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets 
me!-
    I say, away!- Go on. I'll follow thee.
                                        Exeunt Gho
st and Hamlet.
  Hor. He waxes desperate with imagination.
  Mar. Let's follow. 'Tis not fit thus 
to obey him.
  Hor. Have after. To what issue will this come?
  Mar. Something is rotten in the st
ate of Denmark.
  Hor. Heaven will direct it.
  Mar. Nay, let's follow him.
                     
                                    Exeunt.




Scene V.
Elsinore. The Castle. Another part of
 the fortifications.

Enter Ghost and Hamlet.

  Ham. Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak! I'll go 
no further.
  Ghost. Mark me.
  Ham. I will.
  Ghost. My hour is almost come,
    When I to sulp
h'rous and tormenting flames
    Must render up myself.
  Ham. Alas, poor ghost!
  Ghost. Pity me
 not, but lend thy serious hearing
    To what I shall unfold.
  Ham. Speak. I am bound to hear.

  Ghost. So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
  Ham. What?
  Ghost. I am thy father's spi
rit,
    Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
    And for the day confin'd to fast in fire
s,
    Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
    Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am
 forbid
    To tell the secrets of my prison house,
    I could a tale unfold whose lightest word

    Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
    Make thy two eyes, like stars, start fro
m their spheres,
    Thy knotted and combined locks to part,
    And each particular hair to stand
 on end
    Like quills upon the fretful porcupine.
    But this eternal blazon must not be
    T
o ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
    If thou didst ever thy dear father love-
  Ham
. O God!
  Ghost. Revenge his foul and most unnatural murther.
  Ham. Murther?
  Ghost. Murther m
ost foul, as in the best it is;
    But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.
  Ham. Haste me to
 know't, that I, with wings as swift
    As meditation or the thoughts of love,
    May sweep to m
y revenge.
  Ghost. I find thee apt;
    And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
    That r
ots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
    Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.
    'Tis 
given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
    A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark
    Is
 by a forged process of my death
    Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth,
    The serpent th
at did sting thy father's life
    Now wears his crown.
  Ham. O my prophetic soul!
    My uncle?

  Ghost. Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
    With witchcraft of his wit, with traitor
ous gifts-
    O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
    So to seduce!- won to his shameful 
lust
    The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.
    O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there,

    From me, whose love was of that dignity
    That it went hand in hand even with the vow
    I 
made to her in marriage, and to decline
    Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
    To tho
se of mine!
    But virtue, as it never will be mov'd,
    Though lewdness court it in a shape of 
heaven,
    So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
    Will sate itself in a celestial bed
  
  And prey on garbage.
    But soft! methinks I scent the morning air.
    Brief let me be. Sleepi
ng within my orchard,
    My custom always of the afternoon,
    Upon my secure hour thy uncle sto
le,
    With juice of cursed hebona in a vial,
    And in the porches of my ears did pour
    The
 leperous distilment; whose effect
    Holds such an enmity with blood of man
    That swift as qu
icksilver it courses through
    The natural gates and alleys of the body,
    And with a sudden v
igour it doth posset
    And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
    The thin and wholesome bloo
d. So did it mine;
    And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
    Most lazar-like, with vile and 
loathsome crust
    All my smooth body.
    Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
    Of life
, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd;
    Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
    Unhous'l
ed, disappointed, unanel'd,
    No reckoning made, but sent to my account
    With all my imperfec
tions on my head.
  Ham. O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
  Ghost. If thou hast nature in 
thee, bear it not.
    Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
    A couch for luxury and damned inces
t.
    But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
    Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
 
   Against thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven,
    And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge

    To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once.
    The glowworm shows the matin to be near
  
  And gins to pale his uneffectual fire.
    Adieu, adieu, adieu! Remember me.                     
 Exit.

  Ham. O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?
    And shall I couple hell? Hold, h
old, my heart!
    And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
    But bear me stiffly up. Remember 
thee?
    Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
    In this distracted globe. Remember th
ee?
    Yea, from the table of my memory
    I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
    All saw
s of books, all forms, all pressures past
    That youth and observation copied there,
    And thy
 commandment all alone shall live
    Within the book and volume of my brain,
    Unmix'd with bas
er matter. Yes, by heaven!
    O most pernicious woman!
    O villain, villain, smiling, damned vi
llain!
    My tables! Meet it is I set it down
    That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain
;
    At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark.        [Writes.]
    So, uncle, there you are. N
ow to my word:
    It is 'Adieu, adieu! Remember me.'
    I have sworn't.
  Hor. (within) My lord
, my lord!

                   Enter Horatio and Marcellus.

  Mar. Lord Hamlet!
  Hor. Heaven 
secure him!
  Ham. So be it!
  Mar. Illo, ho, ho, my lord!
  Ham. Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird,
 come.
  Mar. How is't, my noble lord?
  Hor. What news, my lord?
  Mar. O, wonderful!
  Hor. Go
od my lord, tell it.
  Ham. No, you will reveal it.
  Hor. Not I, my lord, by heaven!
  Mar. Nor 
I, my lord.
  Ham. How say you then? Would heart of man once think it?
    But you'll be secret?

  Both. Ay, by heaven, my lord.
  Ham. There's neer a villain dwelling in all Denmark
    But he's
 an arrant knave.
  Hor. There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
    To tell us this.

  Ham. Why, right! You are in the right!
    And so, without more circumstance at all,
    I hold 
it fit that we shake hands and part;
    You, as your business and desires shall point you,
    Fo
r every man hath business and desire,
    Such as it is; and for my own poor part,
    Look you, I
'll go pray.
  Hor. These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
  Ham. I am sorry they offend 
you, heartily;
    Yes, faith, heartily.
  Hor. There's no offence, my lord.
  Ham. Yes, by Saint
 Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
    And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
    It is an
 honest ghost, that let me tell you.
    For your desire to know what is between us,
    O'ermaste
r't as you may. And now, good friends,
    As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,
    Give me
 one poor request.
  Hor. What is't, my lord? We will.
  Ham. Never make known what you have seen 
to-night.
  Both. My lord, we will not.
  Ham. Nay, but swear't.
  Hor. In faith,
    My lord, n
ot I.
  Mar. Nor I, my lord- in faith.
  Ham. Upon my sword.
  Mar. We have sworn, my lord, alrea
dy.
  Ham. Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.

                 Ghost cries under the stage.

  Gho
st. Swear.
  Ham. Aha boy, say'st thou so? Art thou there, truepenny?
    Come on! You hear this f
ellow in the cellarage.
    Consent to swear.
  Hor. Propose the oath, my lord.
  Ham. Never to s
peak of this that you have seen.
    Swear by my sword.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
  Ham. Hic et u
bique? Then we'll shift our ground.
    Come hither, gentlemen,
    And lay your hands again upon 
my sword.
    Never to speak of this that you have heard:
    Swear by my sword.
  Ghost. [beneat
h] Swear by his sword.
  Ham. Well said, old mole! Canst work i' th' earth so fast?
    A worthy p
ioner! Once more remove, good friends."
  Hor. O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
  Ha
m. And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
    There are more things in heaven and earth, Hora
tio,
    Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
    But come!
    Here, as before, never, so help
 you mercy,
    How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself
    (As I perchance hereafter shall think 
meet
    To put an antic disposition on),
    That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
   
 With arms encumb'red thus, or this head-shake,
    Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
   
 As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'
    Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There b
e, an if they might,'
    Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
    That you know aught of me- thi
s is not to do,
    So grace and mercy at your most need help you,
    Swear.
  Ghost. [beneath] 
Swear.
                                                   [They swear.]
  Ham. Rest, rest, perturb
ed spirit! So, gentlemen,
    With all my love I do commend me to you;
    And what so poor a man 
as Hamlet is
    May do t' express his love and friending to you,
    God willing, shall not lack.
 Let us go in together;
    And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
    The time is out of jo
int. O cursed spite
    That ever I was born to set it right!
    Nay, come, let's go together.
 
                                                        Exeunt.

Act II. Scene I
.
Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius.

Enter Polonius and Reynaldo.

  Pol. Give him thi
s money and these notes, Reynaldo.
  Rey. I will, my lord.
  Pol. You shall do marvell's wisely, g
ood Reynaldo,
    Before You visit him, to make inquire
    Of his behaviour.
  Rey. My lord, I d
id intend it.
  Pol. Marry, well said, very well said. Look you, sir,
    Enquire me first what Da
nskers are in Paris;
    And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
    What company, at w
hat expense; and finding
    By this encompassment and drift of question
    That they do know my 
son, come you more nearer
    Than your particular demands will touch it.
    Take you, as 'twere,
 some distant knowledge of him;
    As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
    And in part h
im.' Do you mark this, Reynaldo?
  Rey. Ay, very well, my lord.
  Pol. 'And in part him, but,' you
 may say, 'not well.
    But if't be he I mean, he's very wild
    Addicted so and so'; and there 
put on him
    What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
    As may dishonour him- take heed 
of that;
    But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips
    As are companions noted and most kno
wn
    To youth and liberty.
  Rey. As gaming, my lord.
  Pol. Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing
, quarrelling,
    Drabbing. You may go so far.
  Rey. My lord, that would dishonour him.
  Pol. 
Faith, no, as you may season it in the charge.
    You must not put another scandal on him,
    Th
at he is open to incontinency.
    That's not my meaning. But breathe his faults so quaintly
    T
hat they may seem the taints of liberty,
    The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
    A savagen
ess in unreclaimed blood,
    Of general assault.
  Rey. But, my good lord-
  Pol. Wherefore shou
ld you do this?
  Rey. Ay, my lord,
    I would know that.
  Pol. Marry, sir, here's my drift,
 
   And I believe it is a fetch of warrant.
    You laying these slight sullies on my son
    As 't
were a thing a little soil'd i' th' working,
    Mark you,
    Your party in converse, him you wou
ld sound,
    Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
    The youth you breathe of guilty, be a
ssur'd
    He closes with you in this consequence:
    'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentlem
an'-
    According to the phrase or the addition
    Of man and country-
  Rey. Very good, my lor
d.
  Pol. And then, sir, does 'a this- 'a does- What was I about to
say?
    By the mass, I was a
bout to say something! Where did I leave?
  Rey. At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,'
 and
    gentleman.'
  Pol. At 'closes in the consequence'- Ay, marry!
    He closes thus: 'I kno
w the gentleman.
    I saw him yesterday, or t'other day,
    Or then, or then, with such or such;
 and, as you say,
    There was 'a gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
    There falling out at ten
nis'; or perchance,
    'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'
    Videlicet, a brothel, or so fo
rth.
    See you now-
    Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth;
    And thus do we of 
wisdom and of reach,
    With windlasses and with assays of bias,
    By indirections find directi
ons out.
    So, by my former lecture and advice,
    Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?

  Rey. My lord, I have.
  Pol. God b' wi' ye, fare ye well!
  Rey. Good my lord!                
                    [Going.]
  Pol. Observe his inclination in yourself.
  Rey. I shall, my lord.

  Pol. And let him ply his music.
  Rey. Well, my lord.
  Pol. Farewell!
                       
                           Exit Reynaldo.

                       Enter Ophelia.

    How now, O
phelia? What's the matter?
  Oph. O my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
  Pol. With what,
 i' th' name of God?
  Oph. My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
    Lord Hamlet, with his doubl
et all unbrac'd,
    No hat upon his head, his stockings foul'd,
    Ungart'red, and down-gyved to
 his ankle;
    Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,
    And with a look so piteous i
n purport
    As if he had been loosed out of hell
    To speak of horrors- he comes before me.
 
 Pol. Mad for thy love?
  Oph. My lord, I do not know,
    But truly I do fear it.
  Pol. What sa
id he?
  Oph. He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
    Then goes he to the length of all his 
arm,
    And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
    He falls to such perusal of my face
   
 As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so.
    At last, a little shaking of mine arm,
    And thrice
 his head thus waving up and down,
    He rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound
    As it did seem
 to shatter all his bulk
    And end his being. That done, he lets me go,
    And with his head ov
er his shoulder turn'd
    He seem'd to find his way without his eyes,
    For out o' doors he wen
t without their help
    And to the last bended their light on me.
  Pol. Come, go with me. I will
 go seek the King.
    This is the very ecstasy of love,
    Whose violent property fordoes itself

    And leads the will to desperate undertakings
    As oft as any passion under heaven
    That
 does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
    What, have you given him any hard words of late?
  Oph.
 No, my good lord; but, as you did command,
    I did repel his letters and denied
    His access 
to me.
  Pol. That hath made him mad.
    I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
    I had
 not quoted him. I fear'd he did but trifle
    And meant to wrack thee; but beshrew my jealousy!

    By heaven, it is as proper to our age
    To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
    As it i
s common for the younger sort
    To lack discretion. Come, go we to the King.
    This must be kn
own; which, being kept close, might move
    More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
    Come.

                                                         Exeunt.

Scene II.
Elsinore. A room in
 the Castle.

Flourish. [Enter King and Queen, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern,
cum aliis.

  King
. Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
    Moreover that we much did long to see you,
    T
he need we have to use you did provoke
    Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
    Of Haml
et's transformation. So I call it,
    Sith nor th' exterior nor the inward man
    Resembles that
 it was. What it should be,
    More than his father's death, that thus hath put him
    So much f
rom th' understanding of himself,
    I cannot dream of. I entreat you both
    That, being of so 
young days brought up with him,
    And since so neighbour'd to his youth and haviour,
    That yo
u vouchsafe your rest here in our court
    Some little time; so by your companies
    To draw him
 on to pleasures, and to gather
    So much as from occasion you may glean,
    Whether aught to u
s unknown afflicts him thus
    That, open'd, lies within our remedy.
  Queen. Good gentlemen, he 
hath much talk'd of you,
    And sure I am two men there are not living
    To whom he more adhere
s. If it will please you
    To show us so much gentry and good will
    As to expend your time wi
th us awhile
    For the supply and profit of our hope,
    Your visitation shall receive such tha
nks
    As fits a king's remembrance.
  Ros. Both your Majesties
    Might, by the sovereign powe
r you have of us,
    Put your dread pleasures more into command
    Than to entreaty.
  Guil. Bu
t we both obey,
    And here give up ourselves, in the full bent,
    To lay our service freely at
 your feet,
    To be commanded.
  King. Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
  Queen. Th
anks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz.
    And I beseech you instantly to visit
    My too muc
h changed son.- Go, some of you,
    And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
  Guil. Heavens ma
ke our presence and our practices
    Pleasant and helpful to him!
  Queen. Ay, amen!
           
      Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, [with some
                                             
       Attendants].

                         Enter Polonius.

  Pol. Th' ambassadors from Norwa
y, my good lord,
    Are joyfully return'd.
  King. Thou still hast been the father of good news.

  Pol. Have I, my lord? Assure you, my good liege,
    I hold my duty as I hold my soul,
    Both
 to my God and to my gracious king;
    And I do think- or else this brain of mine
    Hunts not t
he trail of policy so sure
    As it hath us'd to do- that I have found
    The very cause of Haml
et's lunacy.
  King. O, speak of that! That do I long to hear.
  Pol. Give first admittance to th'
 ambassadors.
    My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
  King. Thyself do grace to them
, and bring them in.
                                                [Exit Polonius.]
    He tells
 me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found
    The head and source of all your son's distemper.
  Queen.
 I doubt it is no other but the main,
    His father's death and our o'erhasty marriage.
  King. W
ell, we shall sift him.

              Enter Polonius, Voltemand, and Cornelius.

    Welcome, m
y good friends.
    Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?
  Volt. Most fair return of gree
tings and desires.
    Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
    His nephew's levies; which to h
im appear'd
    To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack,
    But better look'd into, he truly found

    It was against your Highness; whereat griev'd,
    That so his sickness, age, and impotence

    Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
    On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys,
   
 Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,
    Makes vow before his uncle never more
    To give 
th' assay of arms against your Majesty.
    Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
    Gives him t
hree thousand crowns in annual fee
    And his commission to employ those soldiers,
    So levied 
as before, against the Polack;
    With an entreaty, herein further shown,
                       
                         [Gives a paper.]
    That it might please you to give quiet pass
    Thro
ugh your dominions for this enterprise,
    On such regards of safety and allowance
    As therein
 are set down.
  King. It likes us well;
    And at our more consider'd time we'll read,
    Answ
er, and think upon this business.
    Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour.
    Go to y
our rest; at night we'll feast together.
    Most welcome home!                       Exeunt Ambass
adors.
  Pol. This business is well ended.
    My liege, and madam, to expostulate
    What majes
ty should be, what duty is,
    Why day is day, night is night, and time is time.
    Were nothing
 but to waste night, day, and time.
    Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
    And tedio
usness the limbs and outward flourishes,
    I will be brief. Your noble son is mad.
    Mad call 
I it; for, to define true madness,
    What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
    But let that 
go.
  Queen. More matter, with less art.
  Pol. Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
    That he i
s mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
    And pity 'tis 'tis true. A foolish figure!
    But fare
well it, for I will use no art.
    Mad let us grant him then. And now remains
    That we find ou
t the cause of this effect-
    Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
    For this effect defec
tive comes by cause.
    Thus it remains, and the remainder thus.
    Perpend.
    I have a daugh
ter (have while she is mine),
    Who in her duty and obedience, mark,
    Hath given me this. Now
 gather, and surmise.
                                             [Reads] the letter.
    'To the
 celestial, and my soul's idol, the most beautified
      Ophelia,'-

    That's an ill phrase, a
 vile phrase; 'beautified' is a vile
      phrase.
    But you shall hear. Thus:
                
                                        [Reads.]
    'In her excellent white bosom, these, &c.'
  
Queen. Came this from Hamlet to her?
  Pol. Good madam, stay awhile. I will be faithful.     [Reads
.]


          'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
            Doubt that the sun doth move;
      
    Doubt truth to be a liar;
            But never doubt I love.
      'O dear Ophelia, I am ill 
at these numbers; I have not art
to
    reckon my groans; but that I love thee best, O most best,

believe
    it. Adieu.
      'Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to
him,


HAMLET.'

    This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me;
    And more above, hath his solicit
ings,
    As they fell out by time, by means, and place,
    All given to mine ear.
  King. But h
ow hath she
    Receiv'd his love?
  Pol. What do you think of me?
  King. As of a man faithful a
nd honourable.
  Pol. I would fain prove so. But what might you think,
    When I had seen this ho
t love on the wing
    (As I perceiv'd it, I must tell you that,
    Before my daughter told me), 
what might you,
    Or my dear Majesty your queen here, think,
    If I had play'd the desk or tab
le book,
    Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
    Or look'd upon this love with idle si
ght?
    What might you think? No, I went round to work
    And my young mistress thus I did bespe
ak:
    'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star.
    This must not be.' And then I prescripts ga
ve her,
    That she should lock herself from his resort,
    Admit no messengers, receive no toke
ns.
    Which done, she took the fruits of my advice,
    And he, repulsed, a short tale to make,

    Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
    Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
    The
nce to a lightness, and, by this declension,
    Into the madness wherein now he raves,
    And al
l we mourn for.
  King. Do you think 'tis this?
  Queen. it may be, very like.
  Pol. Hath there 
been such a time- I would fain know that-
    That I have Positively said ''Tis so,'
    When it p
rov'd otherwise.?
  King. Not that I know.
  Pol. [points to his head and shoulder] Take this from
 this, if
this
      be otherwise.
    If circumstances lead me, I will find
    Where truth is 
hid, though it were hid indeed
    Within the centre.
  King. How may we try it further?
  Pol. Y
ou know sometimes he walks for hours together
    Here in the lobby.
  Queen. So he does indeed.

  Pol. At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him.
    Be you and I behind an arras then.
    Ma
rk the encounter. If he love her not,
    And he not from his reason fall'n thereon
    Let me be 
no assistant for a state,
    But keep a farm and carters.
  King. We will try it.

            
     Enter Hamlet, reading on a book.

  Queen. But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading
.
  Pol. Away, I do beseech you, both away
    I'll board him presently. O, give me leave.
      
                 Exeunt King and Queen, [with Attendants].
    How does my good Lord Hamlet?
  Ham
. Well, God-a-mercy.
  Pol. Do you know me, my lord?
  Ham. Excellent well. You are a fishmonger.

  Pol. Not I, my lord.
  Ham. Then I would you were so honest a man.
  Pol. Honest, my lord?
  H
am. Ay, sir. To be honest, as this world goes, is to be one
man
    pick'd out of ten thousand.
 
 Pol. That's very true, my lord.
  Ham. For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god
  
  kissing carrion- Have you a daughter?
  Pol. I have, my lord.
  Ham. Let her not walk i' th' sun
. Conception is a blessing, but
not
    as your daughter may conceive. Friend, look to't.
  Pol. 
[aside] How say you by that? Still harping on my daughter.
Yet
    he knew me not at first. He sai
d I was a fishmonger. He is
far
    gone, far gone! And truly in my youth I suff'red much
extremi
ty
    for love- very near this. I'll speak to him again.- What do
you
    read, my lord?
  Ham.
 Words, words, words.
  Pol. What is the matter, my lord?
  Ham. Between who?
  Pol. I mean, the 
matter that you read, my lord.
  Ham. Slanders, sir; for the satirical rogue says here that old
me
n
    have grey beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes
    purging thick amber and plum
-tree gum; and that they have a
    plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams. All
which
,
    sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I
hold it
    not honesty to have i
t thus set down; for you yourself, sir,
    should be old as I am if, like a crab, you could go bac
kward.

  Pol. [aside] Though this be madness, yet there is a method
in't.-
   Will You walk out
 of the air, my lord?
  Ham. Into my grave?
  Pol. Indeed, that is out o' th' air. [Aside] How pre
gnant
sometimes
    his replies are! a happiness that often madness hits on,
which
    reason an
d sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of.
I
    will leave him and suddenly contrive the
 means of meeting
between
    him and my daughter.- My honourable lord, I will most humbly
take

    my leave of you.
  Ham. You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more
    willingly 
part withal- except my life, except my life, except
my
    life,

                    Enter Rose
ncrantz and Guildenstern.

  Pol. Fare you well, my lord.
  Ham. These tedious old fools!
  Pol.
 You go to seek the Lord Hamlet. There he is.
  Ros. [to Polonius] God save you, sir!
            
                                    Exit [Polonius].

  Guil. My honour'd lord!
  Ros. My most de
ar lord!
  Ham. My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern?
Ah,
    Rosencrantz! Good
 lads, how do ye both?
  Ros. As the indifferent children of the earth.
  Guil. Happy in that we a
re not over-happy.
    On Fortune's cap we are not the very button.
  Ham. Nor the soles of her sh
oe?
  Ros. Neither, my lord.
  Ham. Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her
    fa
vours?
  Guil. Faith, her privates we.
  Ham. In the secret parts of Fortune? O! most true! she is
 a
    strumpet. What news ?
  Ros. None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
  Ham. Then
 is doomsday near! But your news is not true. Let me
    question more in particular. What have you
, my good friends,
    deserved at the hands of Fortune that she sends you to prison
    hither?

  Guil. Prison, my lord?
  Ham. Denmark's a prison.
  Ros. Then is the world one.
  Ham. A goodly
 one; in which there are many confines, wards, and
    dungeons, Denmark being one o' th' worst.
 
 Ros. We think not so, my lord.
  Ham. Why, then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either
goo
d
    or bad but thinking makes it so. To me it is a prison.
  Ros. Why, then your ambition makes 
it one. 'Tis too narrow for
your
    mind.
  Ham. O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and cou
nt myself a
    king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.
  Guil. Which dreams i
ndeed are ambition; for the very substance
of
    the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.

  Ham. A dream itself is but a shadow.
  Ros. Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a qua
lity
that
    it is but a shadow's shadow.
  Ham. Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs a
nd
outstretch'd
    heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we to th' court? for, by
my
    fay, I ca
nnot reason.
  Both. We'll wait upon you.
  Ham. No such matter! I will not sort you with the rest
 of my
    servants; for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most
    dreadfully attended. B
ut in the beaten way of friendship,
what
    make you at Elsinore?
  Ros. To visit you, my lord; 
no other occasion.
  Ham. Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank
you;
    and su
re, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny.
Were
    you not sent for? Is it your own in
clining? Is it a free
    visitation? Come, deal justly with me. Come, come! Nay,
speak.
  Guil. 
What should we say, my lord?
  Ham. Why, anything- but to th' purpose. You were sent for; and
    
there is a kind of confession in your looks, which your
modesties
    have not craft enough to col
our. I know the good King and
Queen
    have sent for you.
  Ros. To what end, my lord?
  Ham. T
hat you must teach me. But let me conjure you by the
rights
    of our fellowship, by the consonan
cy of our youth, by the
    obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear
a
    be
tter proposer could charge you withal, be even and direct
with
    me, whether you were sent for o
r no.
  Ros. [aside to Guildenstern] What say you?
  Ham. [aside] Nay then, I have an eye of you.-
 If you love me,
hold
    not off.
  Guil. My lord, we were sent for.
  Ham. I will tell you why
. So shall my anticipation prevent your
    discovery, and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult
 no
    feather. I have of late- but wherefore I know not- lost all
my
    mirth, forgone all cus
tom of exercises; and indeed, it goes
so
    heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, t
he
earth,
    seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy,
the
    air, look yo
u, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this
majestical
    roof fretted with golden fire- why, it ap
peareth no other
thing
    to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What
a
    p
iece of work is a man! how noble in reason! how infinite in
    faculties! in form and moving how e
xpress and admirable! in
    action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the
    bea
uty of the world, the paragon of animals! And yet to me
what
    is this quintessence of dust? Man
 delights not me- no, nor
woman
    neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.
  Ros. My
 lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.
  Ham. Why did you laugh then, when I said 'Man deli
ghts not me'?
  Ros. To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten
    entertainment t
he players shall receive from you. We coted
them
    on the way, and hither are they coming to off
er you service.
  Ham. He that plays the king shall be welcome- his Majesty shall
    have tribute
 of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil
and
    target; the lover shall not sigh gratis;
 the humorous man
shall
    end his part in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose
    lun
gs are tickle o' th' sere; and the lady shall say her mind
    freely, or the blank verse shall hal
t for't. What players are
    they?
  Ros. Even those you were wont to take such delight in, the

    tragedians of the city.
  Ham. How chances it they travel? Their residence, both in
    reputa
tion and profit, was better both ways.
  Ros. I think their inhibition comes by the means of the la
te
    innovation.
  Ham. Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in
the
    city? 
Are they so follow'd?
  Ros. No indeed are they not.
  Ham. How comes it? Do they grow rusty?
  R
os. Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there
is,
    sir, an eyrie of children, li
ttle eyases, that cry out on the
top
    of question and are most tyrannically clapp'd for't. Thes
e
are now
    the fashion, and so berattle the common stages (so they call
    them) that many we
aring rapiers are afraid of goosequills and
    dare scarce come thither.
  Ham. What, are they ch
ildren? Who maintains 'em? How are they
    escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than th
ey can
    sing? Will they not say afterwards, if they should grow
    themselves to common player
s (as it is most like, if their
means
    are no better), their writers do them wrong to make them

exclaim
    against their own succession.
  Ros. Faith, there has been much to do on both sides;
 and the
nation
    holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy. There was, for
a
    while, no
 money bid for argument unless the poet and the
player
    went to cuffs in the question.
  Ham. 
Is't possible?
  Guil. O, there has been much throwing about of brains.
  Ham. Do the boys carry i
t away?
  Ros. Ay, that they do, my lord- Hercules and his load too.
  Ham. It is not very strange
; for my uncle is King of Denmark,
and
    those that would make mows at him while my father lived
 give
    twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his picture
in
    little. 'Sblood, t
here is something in this more than
natural, if
    philosophy could find it out.

             
        Flourish for the Players.

  Guil. There are the players.
  Ham. Gentlemen, you are welco
me to Elsinore. Your hands, come!
Th'
    appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me

comply
    with you in this garb, lest my extent to the players (which I
    tell you must show f
airly outwards) should more appear like
    entertainment than yours. You are welcome. But my
uncl
e-father
    and aunt-mother are deceiv'd.
  Guil. In what, my dear lord?
  Ham. I am but mad nor
th-north-west. When the wind is southerly
I
    know a hawk from a handsaw.

                   
         Enter Polonius.

  Pol. Well be with you, gentlemen!
  Ham. Hark you, Guildenstern- and 
you too- at each ear a hearer!
    That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling
 
   clouts.
  Ros. Happily he's the second time come to them; for they say an
old
    man is twice
 a child.
  Ham. I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players. Mark
it.-
   You say right, 
sir; a Monday morning; twas so indeed.
  Pol. My lord, I have news to tell you.
  Ham. My lord, I 
have news to tell you. When Roscius was an
actor in
    Rome-
  Pol. The actors are come hither, 
my lord.
  Ham. Buzz, buzz!
  Pol. Upon my honour-
  Ham. Then came each actor on his ass-
  Pol
. The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy,
    history, pastoral, pastoral-comical
, historical-pastoral,
    tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral;
scene
    i
ndividable, or poem unlimited. Seneca cannot be too heavy,
nor
    Plautus too light. For the law 
of writ and the liberty, these
are
    the only men.
  Ham. O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a t
reasure hadst thou!
  Pol. What treasure had he, my lord?
  Ham. Why,

         'One fair daught
er, and no more,
           The which he loved passing well.'

  Pol. [aside] Still on my daughte
r.
  Ham. Am I not i' th' right, old Jephthah?
  Pol. If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a d
aughter that I
    love passing well.
  Ham. Nay, that follows not.
  Pol. What follows then, my 
lord?
  Ham. Why,

           'As by lot, God wot,'

 and then, you know,

           'It cam
e to pass, as most like it was.'

    The first row of the pious chanson will show you more; for

look
    where my abridgment comes.

                     Enter four or five Players.

    You 
are welcome, masters; welcome, all.- I am glad to see
thee
    well.- Welcome, good friends.- O, m
y old friend? Why, thy
face is
    valanc'd since I saw thee last. Com'st' thou to' beard me in
 
   Denmark?- What, my young lady and mistress? By'r Lady, your
    ladyship is nearer to heaven tha
n when I saw you last by the
    altitude of a chopine. Pray God your voice, like a piece of
    u
ncurrent gold, be not crack'd within the ring.- Masters, you
are
    all welcome. We'll e'en to't 
like French falconers, fly at
    anything we see. We'll have a speech straight. Come, give us
a

    taste of your quality. Come, a passionate speech.
  1. Play. What speech, my good lord?
  Ham.
 I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never
acted;
    or if it was, not above once; fo
r the play, I remember,
pleas'd
    not the million, 'twas caviary to the general; but it was (as

I
    receiv'd it, and others, whose judgments in such matters
cried in
    the top of mine) an 
excellent play, well digested in the
scenes,
    set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remem
ber one said
    there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter
savoury,
    nor no matter
 in the phrase that might indict the author of
    affectation; but call'd it an honest method, as 
wholesome as
    sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech
in't
    I chiefly l
ov'd. 'Twas AEneas' tale to Dido, and thereabout
of it
    especially where he speaks of Priam's s
laughter. If it live
in
    your memory, begin at this line- let me see, let me see:

         '
The rugged Pyrrhus, like th' Hyrcanian beast-'

    'Tis not so; it begins with Pyrrhus:

      
   'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
         Black as his purpose, did the night resemble

         When he lay couched in the ominous horse,
         Hath now this dread and black complexi
on smear'd
         With heraldry more dismal. Head to foot
         Now is be total gules, horrid
ly trick'd
         With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
         Bak'd and impasted w
ith the parching streets,
         That lend a tyrannous and a damned light
         To their lord
's murther. Roasted in wrath and fire,
         And thus o'ersized with coagulate gore,
         W
ith eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
         Old grandsire Priam seeks.'

    So, proce
ed you.
  Pol. Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good
     discretion.

  1. 
Play. 'Anon he finds him,
      Striking too short at Greeks. His antique sword,
      Rebellious 
to his arm, lies where it falls,
      Repugnant to command. Unequal match'd,
      Pyrrhus at Pri
am drives, in rage strikes wide;
      But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
      Th' unn
erved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
      Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
      
Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
      Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear. For lo! his sword,

      Which was declining on the milky head
      Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' th' air to stick.

      So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
      And, like a neutral to his will and matter,
  
    Did nothing.
      But, as we often see, against some storm,
      A silence in the heavens, t
he rack stand still,
      The bold winds speechless, and the orb below
      As hush as death- an
on the dreadful thunder
      Doth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
      Aroused vengea
nce sets him new awork;
      And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
      On Mars's armour, forg
'd for proof eterne,
      With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
      Now falls on Priam
.
      Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods,
      In general synod take away her power;

      Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
      And bowl the round nave down the hil
l of heaven,
      As low as to the fiends!

  Pol. This is too long.
  Ham. It shall to the bar
ber's, with your beard.- Prithee say
on.
    He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps. Say
 on;
come to
    Hecuba.

  1. Play. 'But who, O who, had seen the mobled queen-'

  Ham. 'The
 mobled queen'?
  Pol. That's good! 'Mobled queen' is good.

  1. Play. 'Run barefoot up and down
, threat'ning the flames
      With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head
      Where late the diad
em stood, and for a robe,
      About her lank and all o'erteemed loins,
      A blanket, in the a
larm of fear caught up-
      Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd
      'Gainst Fortun
e's state would treason have pronounc'd.
      But if the gods themselves did see her then,
      
When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
      In Mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,
   
   The instant burst of clamour that she made
      (Unless things mortal move them not at all)
  
    Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven
      And passion in the gods.'

  Pol. Look
, whe'r he has not turn'd his colour, and has tears
in's
    eyes. Prithee no more!
  Ham. 'Tis w
ell. I'll have thee speak out the rest of this
soon.-
    Good my lord, will you see the players w
ell bestow'd? Do you
    hear? Let them be well us'd; for they are the abstract and
brief
    chr
onicles of the time. After your death you were better have
a
    bad epitaph than their ill report
 while you live.
  Pol. My lord, I will use them according to their desert.
  Ham. God's bodykins,
 man, much better! Use every man after his
    desert, and who should scape whipping? Use them afte
r your
own
    honour and dignity. The less they deserve, the more merit is
in
    your bounty. 
Take them in.
  Pol. Come, sirs.
  Ham. Follow him, friends. We'll hear a play to-morrow.
       
          Exeunt Polonius and Players [except the First].
    Dost thou hear me, old friend? Can yo
u play 'The Murther of
    Gonzago'?
  1. Play. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. We'll ha't to-morrow night. Y
ou could, for a need, study a
    speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which I would set down
and

    insert in't, could you not?
  1. Play. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Very well. Follow that lord- and 
look you mock him not.
                                            [Exit First Player.]
    My goo
d friends, I'll leave you till night. You are welcome
to
    Elsinore.
  Ros. Good my lord!
  Ha
m. Ay, so, God b' wi' ye!
                            [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
    Now
 I am alone.
    O what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
    Is it not monstrous that this player h
ere,
    But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
    Could force his soul so to his own conceit

    That, from her working, all his visage wann'd,
    Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,

    A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
    With forms to his conceit? And all for noth
ing!
    For Hecuba!
    What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
    That he should weep for her? 
What would he do,
    Had he the motive and the cue for passion
    That I have? He would drown th
e stage with tears
    And cleave the general ear with horrid speech;
    Make mad the guilty and 
appal the free,
    Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed
    The very faculties of eyes and ear
s.
    Yet I,
    A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak
    Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my 
cause,
    And can say nothing! No, not for a king,
    Upon whose property and most dear life
  
  A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
    Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
    Pl
ucks off my beard and blows it in my face?
    Tweaks me by th' nose? gives me the lie i' th' throa
t
    As deep as to the lungs? Who does me this, ha?
    'Swounds, I should take it! for it cannot
 be
    But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall
    To make oppression bitter, or ere this
    I sh
ould have fatted all the region kites
    With this slave's offal. Bloody bawdy villain!
    Remor
seless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
    O, vengeance!
    Why, what an ass am I! Thi
s is most brave,
    That I, the son of a dear father murther'd,
    Prompted to my revenge by hea
ven and hell,
    Must (like a whore) unpack my heart with words
    And fall a-cursing like a ver
y drab,
    A scullion!
    Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! Hum, I have heard
    That guilty c
reatures, sitting at a play,
    Have by the very cunning of the scene
    Been struck so to the s
oul that presently
    They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
    For murther, though it have no
 tongue, will speak
    With most miraculous organ, I'll have these Players
    Play something lik
e the murther of my father
    Before mine uncle. I'll observe his looks;
    I'll tent him to the
 quick. If he but blench,
    I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
    May be a devil; an
d the devil hath power
    T' assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
    Out of my weakness and
 my melancholy,
    As he is very potent with such spirits,
    Abuses me to damn me. I'll have gr
ounds
    More relative than this. The play's the thing
    Wherein I'll catch the conscience of t
he King.         Exit.

ACT III. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

En
ter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern,
and Lords.

  King. And can you by
 no drift of circumstance
    Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
    Grating so harshly a
ll his days of quiet
    With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
  Ros. He does confess he feels hims
elf distracted,
    But from what cause he will by no means speak.
  Guil. Nor do we find him forw
ard to be sounded,
    But with a crafty madness keeps aloof
    When we would bring him on to som
e confession
    Of his true state.
  Queen. Did he receive you well?
  Ros. Most like a gentlema
n.
  Guil. But with much forcing of his disposition.
  Ros. Niggard of question, but of our demand
s
    Most free in his reply.
  Queen. Did you assay him
    To any pastime?
  Ros. Madam, it so
 fell out that certain players
    We o'erraught on the way. Of these we told him,
    And there d
id seem in him a kind of joy
    To hear of it. They are here about the court,
    And, as I think
, they have already order
    This night to play before him.
  Pol. 'Tis most true;
    And he be
seech'd me to entreat your Majesties
    To hear and see the matter.
  King. With all my heart, an
d it doth much content me
    To hear him so inclin'd.
    Good gentlemen, give him a further edge

    And drive his purpose on to these delights.
  Ros. We shall, my lord.
                      
      Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
  King. Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
    For we have c
losely sent for Hamlet hither,
    That he, as 'twere by accident, may here
    Affront Ophelia.

    Her father and myself (lawful espials)
    Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing unseen,
    W
e may of their encounter frankly judge
    And gather by him, as he is behav'd,
    If't be th' af
fliction of his love, or no,
    That thus he suffers for.
  Queen. I shall obey you;
    And for
 your part, Ophelia, I do wish
    That your good beauties be the happy cause
    Of Hamlet's wild
ness. So shall I hope your virtues
    Will bring him to his wonted way again,
    To both your ho
nours.
  Oph. Madam, I wish it may.
                                                   [Exit Queen
.]
  Pol. Ophelia, walk you here.- Gracious, so please you,
    We will bestow ourselves.- [To Oph
elia] Read on this book,
    That show of such an exercise may colour
    Your loneliness.- We are
 oft to blame in this,
    'Tis too much prov'd, that with devotion's visage
    And pious action 
we do sugar o'er
    The Devil himself.
  King. [aside] O, 'tis too true!
    How smart a lash th
at speech doth give my conscience!
    The harlot's cheek, beautied with plast'ring art,
    Is no
t more ugly to the thing that helps it
    Than is my deed to my most painted word.
    O heavy bu
rthen!
  Pol. I hear him coming. Let's withdraw, my lord.
                                      Ex
eunt King and Polonius].

                           Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. To be, or not to be- 
that is the question:
    Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
    The slings and arrows of o
utrageous fortune
    Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
    And by opposing end them. To 
die- to sleep-
    No more; and by a sleep to say we end
    The heartache, and the thousand natur
al shocks
    That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation
    Devoutly to be wish'd. To die- to sle
ep.
    To sleep- perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub!
    For in that sleep of death what dre
ams may come
    When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
    Must give us pause. There's the r
espect
    That makes calamity of so long life.
    For who would bear the whips and scorns of tim
e,
    Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
    The pangs of despis'd love, the law's
 delay,
    The insolence of office, and the spurns
    That patient merit of th' unworthy takes,

    When he himself might his quietus make
    With a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear,

    To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
    But that the dread of something after death-
    Th
e undiscover'd country, from whose bourn
    No traveller returns- puzzles the will,
    And makes
 us rather bear those ills we have
    Than fly to others that we know not of?
    Thus conscience
 does make cowards of us all,
    And thus the native hue of resolution
    Is sicklied o'er with 
the pale cast of thought,
    And enterprises of great pith and moment
    With this regard their 
currents turn awry
    And lose the name of action.- Soft you now!
    The fair Ophelia!- Nymph, i
n thy orisons
    Be all my sins rememb'red.
  Oph. Good my lord,
    How does your honour for th
is many a day?
  Ham. I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
  Oph. My lord, I have remembrances of
 yours
    That I have longed long to re-deliver.
    I pray you, now receive them.
  Ham. No, no
t I!
    I never gave you aught.
  Oph. My honour'd lord, you know right well you did,
    And wi
th them words of so sweet breath compos'd
    As made the things more rich. Their perfume lost,
  
  Take these again; for to the noble mind
    Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
    Th
ere, my lord.
  Ham. Ha, ha! Are you honest?
  Oph. My lord?
  Ham. Are you fair?
  Oph. What me
ans your lordship?
  Ham. That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit
no
    discou
rse to your beauty.
  Oph. Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with
honesty?
  Ham. 
Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform
    honesty from what it is to a bawd than
 the force of honesty
can
    translate beauty into his likeness. This was sometime a
paradox,
 
   but now the time gives it proof. I did love you once.
  Oph. Indeed, my lord, you made me believ
e so.
  Ham. You should not have believ'd me; for virtue cannot so
    inoculate our old stock but
 we shall relish of it. I loved
you
    not.
  Oph. I was the more deceived.
  Ham. Get thee to 
a nunnery! Why wouldst thou be a breeder of
    sinners? I am myself indifferent honest, but yet I 
could
accuse
    me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne
me.
    I am very
 proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more offences at
my
    beck than I have thoughts to put them 
in, imagination to give
    them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows
as I
   
 do, crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves
all;
    believe none of us. Go thy w
ays to a nunnery. Where's your
    father?
  Oph. At home, my lord.
  Ham. Let the doors be shut 
upon him, that he may play the fool
    nowhere but in's own house. Farewell.
  Oph. O, help him, 
you sweet heavens!
  Ham. If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy
dowry:
    be th
ou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not
escape
    calumny. Get thee to a nunnery. Go
, farewell. Or if thou wilt
    needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what
    
monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go; and quickly too.
    Farewell.
  Oph. O heavenly powe
rs, restore him!
  Ham. I have heard of your paintings too, well enough. God hath
    given you on
e face, and you make yourselves another. You jig,
you
    amble, and you lisp; you nickname God's 
creatures and make
your
    wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't! it hath
made
  
  me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages. Those that are
    married already- all but one- s
hall live; the rest shall keep
as
    they are. To a nunnery, go.                            Exit.

  Oph. O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
    The courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, to
ngue, sword,
    Th' expectancy and rose of the fair state,
    The glass of fashion and the mould
 of form,
    Th' observ'd of all observers- quite, quite down!
    And I, of ladies most deject a
nd wretched,
    That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
    Now see that noble and most sovereig
n reason,
    Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
    That unmatch'd form and feature
 of blown youth
    Blasted with ecstasy. O, woe is me
    T' have seen what I have seen, see what
 I see!

                   Enter King and Polonius.

  King. Love? his affections do not that w
ay tend;
    Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,
    Was not like madness. There's 
something in his soul
    O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
    And I do doubt the hatch an
d the disclose
    Will be some danger; which for to prevent,
    I have in quick determination
 
   Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England
    For the demand of our neglected tribute.
 
   Haply the seas, and countries different,
    With variable objects, shall expel
    This someth
ing-settled matter in his heart,
    Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
    From fashi
on of himself. What think you on't?
  Pol. It shall do well. But yet do I believe
    The origin a
nd commencement of his grief
    Sprung from neglected love.- How now, Ophelia?
    You need not t
ell us what Lord Hamlet said.
    We heard it all.- My lord, do as you please;
    But if you hold
 it fit, after the play
    Let his queen mother all alone entreat him
    To show his grief. Let 
her be round with him;
    And I'll be plac'd so please you, in the ear
    Of all their conferenc
e. If she find him not,
    To England send him; or confine him where
    Your wisdom best shall t
hink.
  King. It shall be so.
    Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.         Exeunt.





Scene II.
Elsinore. hall in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet and three of the Players.

  Ham. S
peak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounc'd it to you,
    trippingly on the tongue. But if you mo
uth it, as many of our
    players do, I had as live the town crier spoke my lines. Nor
do
    no
t saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all
    gently; for in the very torrent, tempe
st, and (as I may say)
    whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and beget a
    temperance 
that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to
the
    soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated f
ellow tear a passion
to
    tatters, to very rags, to split the cars of the groundlings,
who
   
 (for the most part) are capable of nothing but inexplicable
dumb
    shows and noise. I would hav
e such a fellow whipp'd for
o'erdoing
    Termagant. It out-herods Herod. Pray you avoid it.
  Pl
ayer. I warrant your honour.
  Ham. Be not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be
your

    tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the action;
with
    this special observance, 
that you o'erstep not the modesty of
    nature: for anything so overdone is from the purpose of
p
laying,
    whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as
    'twere, the mirror u
p to nature; to show Virtue her own
feature,
    scorn her own image, and the very age and body of
 the time
his
    form and pressure. Now this overdone, or come tardy off,
though
    it make th
e unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious
    grieve; the censure of the which one must in y
our allowance
    o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that
I
    have seen p
lay, and heard others praise, and that highly (not
to
    speak it profanely), that, neither havin
g the accent of
    Christians, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have
so
    strutted a
nd bellowed that I have thought some of Nature's
    journeymen had made men, and not made them wel
l, they
imitated
    humanity so abominably.
  Player. I hope we have reform'd that indifferently
 with us,
sir.
  Ham. O, reform it altogether! And let those that play your
clowns
    speak no 
more than is set down for them. For there be of them
    that will themselves laugh, to set on some
 quantity of barren
    spectators to laugh too, though in the mean time some
necessary
    quest
ion of the play be then to be considered. That's
villanous
    and shows a most pitiful ambition i
n the fool that uses it.
Go
    make you ready.
                                                 
Exeunt Players.

            Enter Polonius, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.

    How now, my lor
d? Will the King hear this piece of work?
  Pol. And the Queen too, and that presently.
  Ham. Bid
 the players make haste, [Exit Polonius.] Will you two
    help to hasten them?
  Both. We will, m
y lord.                       Exeunt they two.
  Ham. What, ho, Horatio!

                      E
nter Horatio.

  Hor. Here, sweet lord, at your service.
  Ham. Horatio, thou art e'en as just a 
man
    As e'er my conversation cop'd withal.
  Hor. O, my dear lord!
  Ham. Nay, do not think I 
flatter;
    For what advancement may I hope from thee,
    That no revenue hast but thy good spir
its
    To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
    No, let the candied tongue 
lick absurd pomp,
    And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
    Where thrift may follow fawnin
g. Dost thou hear?
    Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
    And could of men distingu
ish, her election
    Hath seal'd thee for herself. For thou hast been
    As one, in suff'ring al
l, that suffers nothing;
    A man that Fortune's buffets and rewards
    Hast ta'en with equal th
anks; and blest are those
    Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled
    That they are no
t a pipe for Fortune's finger
    To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
    That is not 
passion's slave, and I will wear him
    In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
    As I do
 thee. Something too much of this I
    There is a play to-night before the King.
    One scene of
 it comes near the circumstance,
    Which I have told thee, of my father's death.
    I prithee, 
when thou seest that act afoot,
    Even with the very comment of thy soul
    Observe my uncle. I
f his occulted guilt
    Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
    It is a damned ghost that we ha
ve seen,
    And my imaginations are as foul
    As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
    F
or I mine eyes will rivet to his face,
    And after we will both our judgments join
    In censur
e of his seeming.
  Hor. Well, my lord.
    If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
  
  And scape detecting, I will pay the theft.

    Sound a flourish. [Enter Trumpets and Kettledrum
s. Danish

      Guildenstern, and o
ther Lords attendant, with the Guard
                       carrying torches.

  Ham. They are co
ming to the play. I must be idle.
    Get you a place.
  King. How fares our cousin Hamlet?
  Ham
. Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish. I eat the
air,
    promise-cramm'd. You cannot fee
d capons so.
  King. I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet. These words are
not
    mine.
  Ha
m. No, nor mine now. [To Polonius] My lord, you play'd once
    i' th' university, you say?
  Pol.
 That did I, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.
  Ham. What did you enact?
  Pol. I did enac
t Julius Caesar; I was kill'd i' th' Capitol;
Brutus
    kill'd me.
  Ham. It was a brute part of
 him to kill so capital a calf
there. Be
    the players ready.
  Ros. Ay, my lord. They stay upo
n your patience.
  Queen. Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
  Ham. No, good mother. Here's m
etal more attractive.
  Pol. [to the King] O, ho! do you mark that?
  Ham. Lady, shall I lie in yo
ur lap?
                                  [Sits down at Ophelia's feet.]

  Oph. No, my lord.
  
Ham. I mean, my head upon your lap?
  Oph. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Do you think I meant country matter
s?
  Oph. I think nothing, my lord.
  Ham. That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
  Op
h. What is, my lord?
  Ham. Nothing.
  Oph. You are merry, my lord.
  Ham. Who, I?
  Oph. Ay, my
 lord.
  Ham. O God, your only jig-maker! What should a man do but be
merry?
    For look you how
 cheerfully my mother looks, and my father
died
    within 's two hours.
  Oph. Nay 'tis twice tw
o months, my lord.
  Ham. So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I'll have
a
    suit o
f sables. O heavens! die two months ago, and not
forgotten
    yet? Then there's hope a great man'
s memory may outlive his
life
    half a year. But, by'r Lady, he must build churches then; or
el
se
    shall he suffer not thinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose

    epitaph is 'For O, for O
, the hobby-horse is forgot!'

               Hautboys play. The dumb show enters.

    Enter a 
King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing
    him and he her. She kneels, and makes show 
of protestation
    unto him. He takes her up, and declines his head upon her
    neck. He lays hi
m down upon a bank of flowers. She, seeing
    him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, take
s off his
    crown, kisses it, pours poison in the sleeper's ears, and
    leaves him. The Queen 
returns, finds the King dead, and makes
    passionate action. The Poisoner with some three or four

Mutes,
    comes in again, seem to condole with her. The dead body is
    carried away. The Pois
oner wooes the Queen with gifts; she
    seems harsh and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts

    his love.
                                                         Exeunt.

  Oph. What means
 this, my lord?
  Ham. Marry, this is miching malhecho; it means mischief.
  Oph. Belike this show
 imports the argument of the play.

                      Enter Prologue.

  Ham. We shall know 
by this fellow. The players cannot keep
counsel;
    they'll tell all.
  Oph. Will he tell us wha
t this show meant?
  Ham. Ay, or any show that you'll show him. Be not you asham'd
to
    show, h
e'll not shame to tell you what it means.
  Oph. You are naught, you are naught! I'll mark the play
.

    Pro. For us, and for our tragedy,
      Here stooping to your clemency,
      We beg your
 hearing patiently.                     [Exit.]

  Ham. Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?

  Oph. 'Tis brief, my lord.
  Ham. As woman's love.

              Enter [two Players as] King 
and Queen.

    King. Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round
      Neptune's salt wash a
nd Tellus' orbed ground,
      And thirty dozen moons with borrowed sheen
      About the world ha
ve times twelve thirties been,
      Since love our hearts, and Hymen did our hands,
      Unite c
omutual in most sacred bands.
    Queen. So many journeys may the sun and moon
      Make us again
 count o'er ere love be done!
      But woe is me! you are so sick of late,
      So far from chee
r and from your former state.
      That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
      Discomfort 
you, my lord, it nothing must;
      For women's fear and love holds quantity,
      In neither au
ght, or in extremity.
      Now what my love is, proof hath made you know;
      And as my love is
 siz'd, my fear is so.
      Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
      Where little
 fears grow great, great love grows there.
    King. Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly to
o;
      My operant powers their functions leave to do.
      And thou shalt live in this fair wor
ld behind,
      Honour'd, belov'd, and haply one as kind
      For husband shalt thou-
    Queen
. O, confound the rest!
      Such love must needs be treason in my breast.
      When second husb
and let me be accurst!
      None wed the second but who killed the first.

  Ham. [aside] Wormwo
od, wormwood!

    Queen. The instances that second marriage move
      Are base respects of thri
ft, but none of love.
      A second time I kill my husband dead
      When second husband kisses 
me in bed.
    King. I do believe you think what now you speak;
      But what we do determine oft
 we break.
      Purpose is but the slave to memory,
      Of violent birth, but poor validity;
 
     Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree,
      But fall unshaken when they mellow be.

      Most necessary 'tis that we forget
      To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt.
     
 What to ourselves in passion we propose,
      The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
      T
he violence of either grief or joy
      Their own enactures with themselves destroy.
      Where 
joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
      Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
     
 This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
      That even our loves should with our fortunes
 change;
      For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
      Whether love lead fortune, or else 
fortune love.
      The great man down, you mark his favourite flies,
      The poor advanc'd make
s friends of enemies;
      And hitherto doth love on fortune tend,
      For who not needs shall 
never lack a friend,
      And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
      Directly seasons him hi
s enemy.
      But, orderly to end where I begun,
      Our wills and fates do so contrary run
  
    That our devices still are overthrown;
      Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own.

      So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
      But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is
 dead.
    Queen. Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light,
      Sport and repose lock from me
 day and night,
      To desperation turn my trust and hope,
      An anchor's cheer in prison be 
my scope,
      Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
      Meet what I would have well, and i
t destroy,
      Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
      If, once a widow, ever I be w
ife!

  Ham. If she should break it now!

    King. 'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhi
le.
      My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile
      The tedious day with sleep.
    Qu
een. Sleep rock thy brain,
                                                    [He] sleeps.
      
And never come mischance between us twain!
Exit.

  Ham. Madam, how like you this play?
  Queen.
 The lady doth protest too much, methinks.
  Ham. O, but she'll keep her word.
  King. Have you he
ard the argument? Is there no offence in't?
  Ham. No, no! They do but jest, poison in jest; no off
ence i'
th'
    world.
  King. What do you call the play?
  Ham. 'The Mousetrap.' Marry, how? Tr
opically. This play is the
    image of a murther done in Vienna. Gonzago is the duke's
name;
   
 his wife, Baptista. You shall see anon. 'Tis a knavish piece
of
    work; but what o' that? Your 
Majesty, and we that have free
    souls, it touches us not. Let the gall'd jade winch; our
wither
s
    are unwrung.

                         Enter Lucianus.

    This is one Lucianus, nephew 
to the King.
  Oph. You are as good as a chorus, my lord.
  Ham. I could interpret between you and
 your love, if I could
see
    the puppets dallying.
  Oph. You are keen, my lord, you are keen.

  Ham. It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
  Oph. Still better, and worse.
  Ham. S
o you must take your husbands.- Begin, murtherer. Pox,
leave
    thy damnable faces, and begin! Co
me, the croaking raven doth
    bellow for revenge.

    Luc. Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fi
t, and time agreeing;
      Confederate season, else no creature seeing;
      Thou mixture rank, 
of midnight weeds collected,
      With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,
      Thy na
tural magic and dire property
      On wholesome life usurp immediately.
                         
          Pours the poison in his ears.

  Ham. He poisons him i' th' garden for's estate. His nam
e's
Gonzago.
    The story is extant, and written in very choice Italian. You
    shall see anon 
how the murtherer gets the love of Gonzago's
wife.
  Oph. The King rises.
  Ham. What, frighted w
ith false fire?
  Queen. How fares my lord?
  Pol. Give o'er the play.
  King. Give me some light
! Away!
  All. Lights, lights, lights!
                              Exeunt all but Hamlet and Hor
atio.
  Ham.   Why, let the strucken deer go weep,
          The hart ungalled play;
         For
 some must watch, while some must sleep:
          Thus runs the world away.
    Would not this, s
ir, and a forest of feathers- if the rest of
my
    fortunes turn Turk with me-with two Provincial
 roses on my
raz'd
    shoes, get me a fellowship in a cry of players, sir?
  Hor. Half a share.

  Ham.   A whole one I!
         For thou dost know, O Damon dear,
           This realm dismantl
ed was
         Of Jove himself; and now reigns here
           A very, very- pajock.
  Hor. You 
might have rhym'd.
  Ham. O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand
    pound! Did
st perceive?
  Hor. Very well, my lord.
  Ham. Upon the talk of the poisoning?
  Hor. I did very 
well note him.
  Ham.   Aha! Come, some music! Come, the recorders!
         For if the King like 
not the comedy,
         Why then, belike he likes it not, perdy.
    Come, some music!

       
         Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Guil. Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.

  Ham. Sir, a whole history.
  Guil. The King, sir-
  Ham. Ay, sir, what of him?
  Guil. Is in h
is retirement, marvellous distemper'd.
  Ham. With drink, sir?
  Guil. No, my lord; rather with ch
oler.
  Ham. Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this
to
    the doctor; for me
 to put him to his purgation would perhaps
    plunge him into far more choler.
  Guil. Good my lo
rd, put your discourse into some frame, and
start
    not so wildly from my affair.
  Ham. I am t
ame, sir; pronounce.
  Guil. The Queen, your mother, in most great affliction of
spirit
    hath 
sent me to you.
  Ham. You are welcome.
  Guil. Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the rig
ht
breed.
    If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, I will
do
    your mother's 
commandment; if not, your pardon and my return
    shall be the end of my business.
  Ham. Sir, I 
cannot.
  Guil. What, my lord?
  Ham. Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseas'd. But, sir,
s
uch
    answer as I can make, you shall command; or rather, as you
say,
    my mother. Therefore 
no more, but to the matter! My mother,
you
    say-
  Ros. Then thus she says: your behaviour hat
h struck her into
    amazement and admiration.
  Ham. O wonderful son, that can so stonish a moth
er! But is
there no
    sequel at the heels of this mother's admiration? Impart.
  Ros. She desir
es to speak with you in her closet ere you go to
bed.
  Ham. We shall obey, were she ten times our
 mother. Have you any
    further trade with us?
  Ros. My lord, you once did love me.
  Ham. And
 do still, by these pickers and stealers!
  Ros. Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? You
 do
surely
    bar the door upon your own liberty, if you deny your griefs
to
    your friend.

  Ham. Sir, I lack advancement.
  Ros. How can that be, when you have the voice of the King
himsel
f
    for your succession in Denmark?
  Ham. Ay, sir, but 'while the grass grows'- the proverb is

something
    musty.

                     Enter the Players with recorders.

    O, the recor
ders! Let me see one. To withdraw with you- why
do
    you go about to recover the wind of me, as 
if you would drive
me
    into a toil?
  Guil. O my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too

unmannerly.
  Ham. I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this
pipe?
  Guil. My lord,
 I cannot.
  Ham. I pray you.
  Guil. Believe me, I cannot.
  Ham. I do beseech you.
  Guil. I k
now, no touch of it, my lord.
  Ham. It is as easy as lying. Govern these ventages with your
    f
ingers and thumbs, give it breath with your mouth, and it
will
    discourse most eloquent music. 
Look you, these are the stops.
  Guil. But these cannot I command to any utt'rance of harmony. I
 
   have not the skill.
  Ham. Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me!
You
    wou
ld play upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you
would
    pluck out the heart of my mystery;
 you would sound me from my
    lowest note to the top of my compass; and there is much
music,
  
  excellent voice, in this little organ, yet cannot you make it
    speak. 'Sblood, do you think I 
am easier to be play'd on than
a
    pipe? Call me what instrument you will, though you can fret

me,
    you cannot play upon me.

                        Enter Polonius.

    God bless you, s
ir!
  Pol. My lord, the Queen would speak with you, and presently.
  Ham. Do you see yonder cloud 
that's almost in shape of a camel?
  Pol. By th' mass, and 'tis like a camel indeed.
  Ham. Methin
ks it is like a weasel.
  Pol. It is back'd like a weasel.
  Ham. Or like a whale.
  Pol. Very li
ke a whale.
  Ham. Then will I come to my mother by-and-by.- They fool me to
the
    top of my be
nt.- I will come by-and-by.
  Pol. I will say so.                                      Exit.
  Ham
. 'By-and-by' is easily said.- Leave me, friends.
                                        [Exeunt a
ll but Hamlet.]

    'Tis now the very witching time of night,
    When churchyards yawn, and hel
l itself breathes out
    Contagion to this world. Now could I drink hot blood
    And do such bit
ter business as the day
    Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother!
    O heart, lose not 
thy nature; let not ever
    The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom.
    Let me be cruel, not unna
tural;
    I will speak daggers to her, but use none.
    My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites
-
    How in my words somever she be shent,
    To give them seals never, my soul, consent!       
      Exit.




Scene III.
A room in the Castle.

Enter King, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.


  King. I like him not, nor stands it safe with us
    To let his madness range. Therefore prep
are you;
    I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
    And he to England shall along with you
.
    The terms of our estate may not endure
    Hazard so near us as doth hourly grow
    Out of
 his lunacies.
  Guil. We will ourselves provide.
    Most holy and religious fear it is
    To k
eep those many many bodies safe
    That live and feed upon your Majesty.
  Ros. The single and pe
culiar life is bound
    With all the strength and armour of the mind
    To keep itself from noya
nce; but much more
    That spirit upon whose weal depends and rests
    The lives of many. The ce
sse of majesty
    Dies not alone, but like a gulf doth draw
    What's near it with it. It is a m
assy wheel,
    Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,
    To whose huge spokes ten thousand le
sser things
    Are mortis'd and adjoin'd; which when it falls,
    Each small annexment, petty co
nsequence,
    Attends the boist'rous ruin. Never alone
    Did the king sigh, but with a general 
groan.
  King. Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;
    For we will fetters put upon this f
ear,
    Which now goes too free-footed.
  Both. We will haste us.
                              
                 Exeunt Gentlemen.

                   Enter Polonius.

  Pol. My lord, he's goi
ng to his mother's closet.
    Behind the arras I'll convey myself
    To hear the process. I'll w
arrant she'll tax him home;
    And, as you said, and wisely was it said,
    'Tis meet that some 
more audience than a mother,
    Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear
    The speech, 
of vantage. Fare you well, my liege.
    I'll call upon you ere you go to bed
    And tell you wha
t I know.
  King. Thanks, dear my lord.
                                                Exit [Polo
nius].
    O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven;
    It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,

    A brother's murther! Pray can I not,
    Though inclination be as sharp as will.
    My stro
nger guilt defeats my strong intent,
    And, like a man to double business bound,
    I stand in 
pause where I shall first begin,
    And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
    Were thicker t
han itself with brother's blood,
    Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
    To wash it 
white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
    But to confront the visage of offence?
    And what's in p
rayer but this twofold force,
    To be forestalled ere we come to fall,
    Or pardon'd being dow
n? Then I'll look up;
    My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer
    Can serve my turn? 'Fo
rgive me my foul murther'?
    That cannot be; since I am still possess'd
    Of those effects for
 which I did the murther-
    My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.
    May one be pardon'd a
nd retain th' offence?
    In the corrupted currents of this world
    Offence's gilded hand may s
hove by justice,
    And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
    Buys out the law; but 'tis not 
so above.
    There is no shuffling; there the action lies
    In his true nature, and we ourselve
s compell'd,
    Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
    To give in evidence. What then?
 What rests?
    Try what repentance can. What can it not?
    Yet what can it when one cannot rep
ent?
    O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
    O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,

    Art more engag'd! Help, angels! Make assay.
    Bow, stubborn knees; and heart with strings of
 steel,
    Be soft as sinews of the new-born babe!
    All may be well.                          
        He kneels.

                         Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Now might I do it pat, now he
 is praying;
    And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven,
    And so am I reveng'd. That would
 be scann'd.
    A villain kills my father; and for that,
    I, his sole son, do this same villai
n send
    To heaven.
    Why, this is hire and salary, not revenge!
    He took my father grossl
y, full of bread,
    With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
    And how his audit stan
ds, who knows save heaven?
    But in our circumstance and course of thought,
    'Tis heavy with 
him; and am I then reveng'd,
    To take him in the purging of his soul,
    When he is fit and se
asoned for his passage?
    No.
    Up, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent.
    When he is d
runk asleep; or in his rage;
    Or in th' incestuous pleasure of his bed;
    At gaming, swearing
, or about some act
    That has no relish of salvation in't-
    Then trip him, that his heels ma
y kick at heaven,
    And that his soul may be as damn'd and black
    As hell, whereto it goes. M
y mother stays.
    This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.              Exit.
  King. [rises] M
y words fly up, my thoughts remain below.
    Words without thoughts never to heaven go.           
  Exit.




Scene IV.
The Queen's closet.

Enter Queen and Polonius.

  Pol. He will come 
straight. Look you lay home to him.
    Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,
    
And that your Grace hath screen'd and stood between
    Much heat and him. I'll silence me even her
e.
    Pray you be round with him.
  Ham. (within) Mother, mother, mother!
  Queen. I'll warrant 
you; fear me not. Withdraw; I hear him
coming.
                              [Polonius hides behin
d the arras.]

                          Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Now, mother, what's the matter?

  Queen. Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
  Ham. Mother, you have my father much offende
d.
  Queen. Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
  Ham. Go, go, you question with a wicked 
tongue.
  Queen. Why, how now, Hamlet?
  Ham. What's the matter now?
  Queen. Have you forgot me?

  Ham. No, by the rood, not so!
    You are the Queen, your husband's brother's wife,
    And (w
ould it were not so!) you are my mother.
  Queen. Nay, then I'll set those to you that can speak.

  Ham. Come, come, and sit you down. You shall not budge;
    You go not till I set you up a glass

    Where you may see the inmost part of you.
  Queen. What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murther me
?
    Help, help, ho!
  Pol. [behind] What, ho! help, help, help!
  Ham. [draws] How now? a rat? 
Dead for a ducat, dead!
            [Makes a pass through the arras and] kills Polonius.
  Pol. [b
ehind] O, I am slain!
  Queen. O me, what hast thou done?
  Ham. Nay, I know not. Is it the King?

  Queen. O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
  Ham. A bloody deed- almost as bad, good mother,

    As kill a king, and marry with his brother.
  Queen. As kill a king?
  Ham. Ay, lady, it was
 my word.
                         [Lifts up the arras and sees Polonius.]
    Thou wretched, rash
, intruding fool, farewell!
    I took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune.
    Thou find'st to 
be too busy is some danger.
    Leave wringing of your hands. Peace! sit you down
    And let me w
ring your heart; for so I shall
    If it be made of penetrable stuff;
    If damned custom have n
ot braz'd it so
    That it is proof and bulwark against sense.
  Queen. What have I done that tho
u dar'st wag thy tongue
    In noise so rude against me?
  Ham. Such an act
    That blurs the gr
ace and blush of modesty;
    Calls virtue hypocrite; takes off the rose
    From the fair forehea
d of an innocent love,
    And sets a blister there; makes marriage vows
    As false as dicers' o
aths. O, such a deed
    As from the body of contraction plucks
    The very soul, and sweet relig
ion makes
    A rhapsody of words! Heaven's face doth glow;
    Yea, this solidity and compound ma
ss,
    With tristful visage, as against the doom,
    Is thought-sick at the act.
  Queen. Ah me
, what act,
    That roars so loud and thunders in the index?
  Ham. Look here upon th's picture, 
and on this,
    The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
    See what a grace was seated on t
his brow;
    Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
    An eye like Mars, to threaten and c
ommand;
    A station like the herald Mercury
    New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill:
    A com
bination and a form indeed
    Where every god did seem to set his seal
    To give the world assu
rance of a man.
    This was your husband. Look you now what follows.
    Here is your husband, li
ke a mildew'd ear
    Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
    Could you on this fair mo
untain leave to feed,
    And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes
    You cannot call it love; 
for at your age
    The heyday in the blood is tame, it's humble,
    And waits upon the judgment;
 and what judgment
    Would step from this to this? Sense sure you have,
    Else could you not h
ave motion; but sure that sense
    Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,
    Nor sense to ecst
acy was ne'er so thrall'd
    But it reserv'd some quantity of choice
    To serve in such a diffe
rence. What devil was't
    That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
    Eyes without feeling,
 feeling without sight,
    Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
    Or but a sickly par
t of one true sense
    Could not so mope.
    O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
    
If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
    To flaming youth let virtue be as wax
    And melt i
n her own fire. Proclaim no shame
    When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
    Since frost
 itself as actively doth burn,
    And reason panders will.
  Queen. O Hamlet, speak no more!
   
 Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul,
    And there I see such black and grained spots
    As
 will not leave their tinct.
  Ham. Nay, but to live
    In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
  
  Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love
    Over the nasty sty!
  Queen. O, speak to me n
o more!
    These words like daggers enter in mine ears.
    No more, sweet Hamlet!
  Ham. A murt
herer and a villain!
    A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
    Of your precedent lord; 
a vice of kings;
    A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
    That from a shelf the precious dia
dem stole
    And put it in his pocket!
  Queen. No more!

                Enter the Ghost in hi
s nightgown.

  Ham. A king of shreds and patches!-
    Save me and hover o'er me with your wings
,
    You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?
  Queen. Alas, he's mad!
  Ham. Do yo
u not come your tardy son to chide,
    That, laps'd in time and passion, lets go by
    Th' impor
tant acting of your dread command?
    O, say!
  Ghost. Do not forget. This visitation
    Is but
 to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
    But look, amazement on thy mother sits.
    O, step betwe
en her and her fighting soul
    Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works.
    Speak to her, Haml
et.
  Ham. How is it with you, lady?
  Queen. Alas, how is't with you,
    That you do bend your 
eye on vacancy,
    And with th' encorporal air do hold discourse?
    Forth at your eyes your spi
rits wildly peep;
    And, as the sleeping soldiers in th' alarm,
    Your bedded hairs, like life
 in excrements,
    Start up and stand an end. O gentle son,
    Upon the heat and flame of thy di
stemper
    Sprinkle cool patience! Whereon do you look?
  Ham. On him, on him! Look you how pale 
he glares!
    His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
    Would make them capable.- Do
 not look upon me,
    Lest with this piteous action you convert
    My stern effects. Then what I
 have to do
    Will want true colour- tears perchance for blood.
  Queen. To whom do you speak th
is?
  Ham. Do you see nothing there?
  Queen. Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
  Ham. Nor d
id you nothing hear?
  Queen. No, nothing but ourselves.
  Ham. Why, look you there! Look how it s
teals away!
    My father, in his habit as he liv'd!
    Look where he goes even now out at the po
rtal!
                                                     Exit Ghost.
  Queen. This is the very c
oinage of your brain.
    This bodiless creation ecstasy
    Is very cunning in.
  Ham. Ecstasy?

    My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time
    And makes as healthful music. It is not madne
ss
    That I have utt'red. Bring me to the test,
    And I the matter will reword; which madness

    Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
    Lay not that flattering unction to your soul

    That not your trespass but my madness speaks.
    It will but skin and film the ulcerous plac
e,
    Whiles rank corruption, mining all within,
    Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;

    Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
    And do not spread the compost on the weeds
   
 To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;
    For in the fatness of these pursy times
    V
irtue itself of vice must pardon beg-
    Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.
  Queen. O H
amlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
  Ham. O, throw away the worser part of it,
    And live
 the purer with the other half,
    Good night- but go not to my uncle's bed.
    Assume a virtue,
 if you have it not.
    That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat
    Of habits evil, is angel
 yet in this,
    That to the use of actions fair and good
    He likewise gives a frock or livery
,
    That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,
    And that shall lend a kind of easiness
    To t
he next abstinence; the next more easy;
    For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
    And
 either [master] the devil, or throw him out
    With wondrous potency. Once more, good night;
   
 And when you are desirous to be blest,
    I'll blessing beg of you.- For this same lord,
    I d
o repent; but heaven hath pleas'd it so,
    To punish me with this, and this with me,
    That I 
must be their scourge and minister.
    I will bestow him, and will answer well
    The death I ga
ve him. So again, good night.
    I must be cruel, only to be kind;
    Thus bad begins, and worse
 remains behind.
    One word more, good lady.
  Queen. What shall I do?
  Ham. Not this, by no m
eans, that I bid you do:
    Let the bloat King tempt you again to bed;
    Pinch wanton on your c
heek; call you his mouse;
    And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
    Or paddling in your ne
ck with his damn'd fingers,
    Make you to ravel all this matter out,
    That I essentially am n
ot in madness,
    But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;
    For who that's but a queen,
 fair, sober, wise,
    Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib
    Such dear concernings hide? Wh
o would do so?
    No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
    Unpeg the basket on the house's top,

    Let the birds fly, and like the famous ape,
    To try conclusions, in the basket creep
    An
d break your own neck down.
  Queen. Be thou assur'd, if words be made of breath,
    And breath o
f life, I have no life to breathe
    What thou hast said to me.
  Ham. I must to England; you kno
w that?
  Queen. Alack,
    I had forgot! 'Tis so concluded on.
  Ham. There's letters seal'd; an
d my two schoolfellows,
    Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,
    They bear the mandate; 
they must sweep my way
    And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
    For 'tis the sport to have 
the enginer
    Hoist with his own petar; and 't shall go hard
    But I will delve one yard below
 their mines
    And blow them at the moon. O, 'tis most sweet
    When in one line two crafts dir
ectly meet.
    This man shall set me packing.
    I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.-
  
  Mother, good night.- Indeed, this counsellor
    Is now most still, most secret, and most grave,

    Who was in life a foolish peating knave.
    Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.
    G
ood night, mother.
                  [Exit the Queen. Then] Exit Hamlet, tugging in
              
                                         Polonius.

ACT IV. Scene I.
Elsinore. 
A room in the Castle.

Enter King and Queen, with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  King. There's
 matter in these sighs. These profound heaves
    You must translate; 'tis fit we understand them.

    Where is your son?
  Queen. Bestow this place on us a little while.
                         
 [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
    Ah, mine own lord, what have I seen to-night!
  King. 
What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
  Queen. Mad as the sea and wind when both contend
    Which is t
he mightier. In his lawless fit
    Behind the arras hearing something stir,
    Whips out his rap
ier, cries 'A rat, a rat!'
    And in this brainish apprehension kills
    The unseen good old man
.
  King. O heavy deed!
    It had been so with us, had we been there.
    His liberty is full of
 threats to all-
    To you yourself, to us, to every one.
    Alas, how shall this bloody deed be
 answer'd?
    It will be laid to us, whose providence
    Should have kept short, restrain'd, and
 out of haunt
    This mad young man. But so much was our love
    We would not understand what wa
s most fit,
    But, like the owner of a foul disease,
    To keep it from divulging, let it feed

    Even on the pith of life. Where is he gone?
  Queen. To draw apart the body he hath kill'd;
 
   O'er whom his very madness, like some ore
    Among a mineral of metals base,
    Shows itself 
pure. He weeps for what is done.
  King. O Gertrude, come away!
    The sun no sooner shall the mo
untains touch
    But we will ship him hence; and this vile deed
    We must with all our majesty 
and skill
    Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!

             Enter Rosencrantz and 
Guildenstern.

    Friends both, go join you with some further aid.
    Hamlet in madness hath Po
lonius slain,
    And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him.
    Go seek him out; speak fai
r, and bring the body
    Into the chapel. I pray you haste in this.
                          Exe
unt [Rosencrantz and Guildenstern].
    Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends
    And l
et them know both what we mean to do
    And what's untimely done. [So haply slander-]
    Whose w
hisper o'er the world's diameter,
    As level as the cannon to his blank,
    Transports his pois
oned shot- may miss our name
    And hit the woundless air.- O, come away!
    My soul is full of 
discord and dismay.
                                                         Exeunt.




Scene
 II.
Elsinore. A passage in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Safely stow'd.
  Gentlemen. (wi
thin) Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!
  Ham. But soft! What noise? Who calls on Hamlet? O, here they
come.


               Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Ros. What have you done, my lord, with the 
dead body?
  Ham. Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
  Ros. Tell us where 'tis, that we ma
y take it thence
    And bear it to the chapel.
  Ham. Do not believe it.
  Ros. Believe what?
 
 Ham. That I can keep your counsel, and not mine own. Besides,
to be
    demanded of a sponge, wha
t replication should be made by the
son
    of a king?
  Ros. Take you me for a sponge, my lord?

  Ham. Ay, sir; that soaks up the King's countenance, his
rewards,
    his authorities. But such 
officers do the King best service
in
    the end. He keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his

jaw;
    first mouth'd, to be last swallowed. When he needs what you
have
    glean'd, it is bu
t squeezing you and, sponge, you shall be
dry
    again.
  Ros. I understand you not, my lord.
 
 Ham. I am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.
  Ros. My lord, you must tell us w
here the body is and go with us
to
    the King.
  Ham. The body is with the King, but the King i
s not with the
body.
    The King is a thing-
  Guil. A thing, my lord?
  Ham. Of nothing. Bring
 me to him. Hide fox, and all after.
                                                         Exeun
t.




Scene III.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King.

  King. I have sent to see
k him and to find the body.
    How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
    Yet must not we 
put the strong law on him.
    He's lov'd of the distracted multitude,
    Who like not in their j
udgment, but their eyes;
    And where 'tis so, th' offender's scourge is weigh'd,
    But never t
he offence. To bear all smooth and even,
    This sudden sending him away must seem
    Deliberate
 pause. Diseases desperate grown
    By desperate appliance are reliev'd,
    Or not at all.

  
                  Enter Rosencrantz.

    How now O What hath befall'n?
  Ros. Where the dead bod
y is bestow'd, my lord,
    We cannot get from him.
  King. But where is he?
  Ros. Without, my l
ord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
  King. Bring him before us.
  Ros. Ho, Guildenstern! Bring i
n my lord.

        Enter Hamlet and Guildenstern [with Attendants].

  King. Now, Hamlet, where
's Polonius?
  Ham. At supper.
  King. At supper? Where?
  Ham. Not where he eats, but where he i
s eaten. A certain
    convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your worm is
your
    only e
mperor for diet. We fat all creatures else to fat us,
and
    we fat ourselves for maggots. Your f
at king and your lean
beggar
    is but variable service- two dishes, but to one table. That's
th
e
    end.
  King. Alas, alas!
  Ham. A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and

eat
    of the fish that hath fed of that worm.
  King. What dost thou mean by this?
  Ham. Nothi
ng but to show you how a king may go a progress
through
    the guts of a beggar.
  King. Where i
s Polonius?
  Ham. In heaven. Send thither to see. If your messenger find him
not
    there, seek
 him i' th' other place yourself. But indeed, if
you
    find him not within this month, you shall
 nose him as you go
up
    the stair, into the lobby.
  King. Go seek him there. [To Attendants.]

  Ham. He will stay till you come.
                                            [Exeunt Attendants
.]
  King. Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,-
    Which we do tender as we dearly grie
ve
    For that which thou hast done,- must send thee hence
    With fiery quickness. Therefore pr
epare thyself.
    The bark is ready and the wind at help,
    Th' associates tend, and everything
 is bent
    For England.
  Ham. For England?
  King. Ay, Hamlet.
  Ham. Good.
  King. So is it
, if thou knew'st our purposes.
  Ham. I see a cherub that sees them. But come, for England!
    F
arewell, dear mother.
  King. Thy loving father, Hamlet.
  Ham. My mother! Father and mother is ma
n and wife; man and wife
is
    one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England!
Exit.
  King. F
ollow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard.
    Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night.
  
  Away! for everything is seal'd and done
    That else leans on th' affair. Pray you make haste.

                            Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]
    And, England, if my love thou 
hold'st at aught,-
    As my great power thereof may give thee sense,
    Since yet thy cicatrice 
looks raw and red
    After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
    Pays homage to us,- thou mayst 
not coldly set
    Our sovereign process, which imports at full,
    By letters congruing to that 
effect,
    The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;
    For like the hectic in my blood he ra
ges,
    And thou must cure me. Till I know 'tis done,
    Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er beg
un.             Exit.

Scene IV.
Near Elsinore.

Enter Fortinbras with his Ar
my over the stage.

  For. Go, Captain, from me greet the Danish king.
    Tell him that by his l
icense Fortinbras
    Craves the conveyance of a promis'd march
    Over his kingdom. You know the
 rendezvous.
    If that his Majesty would aught with us,
    We shall express our duty in his eye
;
    And let him know so.
  Capt. I will do't, my lord.
  For. Go softly on.
                  
                 Exeunt [all but the Captain].

       Enter Hamlet, Rosencrantz, [Guildenstern,] 
and others.

  Ham. Good sir, whose powers are these?
  Capt. They are of Norway, sir.
  Ham. Ho
w purpos'd, sir, I pray you?
  Capt. Against some part of Poland.
  Ham. Who commands them, sir?

  Capt. The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.
  Ham. Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
    
Or for some frontier?
  Capt. Truly to speak, and with no addition,
    We go to gain a little pat
ch of ground
    That hath in it no profit but the name.
    To pay five ducats, five, I would not
 farm it;
    Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
    A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.

  Ham. Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
  Capt. Yes, it is already garrison'd.
  Ham. 
Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
    Will not debate the question of this straw.
    
This is th' imposthume of much wealth and peace,
    That inward breaks, and shows no cause without

    Why the man dies.- I humbly thank you, sir.
  Capt. God b' wi' you, sir.                     
        [Exit.]
  Ros. Will't please you go, my lord?
  Ham. I'll be with you straight. Go a littl
e before.
                                        [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]
    How all occasions d
o inform against me
    And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
    If his chief good and market 
of his time
    Be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.
    Sure he that made us with such lar
ge discourse,
    Looking before and after, gave us not
    That capability and godlike reason
  
  To fust in us unus'd. Now, whether it be
    Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple
    Of thi
nking too precisely on th' event,-
    A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
    An
d ever three parts coward,- I do not know
    Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do,'
    Sith
 I have cause, and will, and strength, and means
    To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me.
 
   Witness this army of such mass and charge,
    Led by a delicate and tender prince,
    Whose s
pirit, with divine ambition puff'd,
    Makes mouths at the invisible event,
    Exposing what is 
mortal and unsure
    To all that fortune, death, and danger dare,
    Even for an eggshell. Right
ly to be great
    Is not to stir without great argument,
    But greatly to find quarrel in a str
aw
    When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,
    That have a father kill'd, a mother stain
'd,
    Excitements of my reason and my blood,
    And let all sleep, while to my shame I see
   
 The imminent death of twenty thousand men
    That for a fantasy and trick of fame
    Go to thei
r graves like beds, fight for a plot
    Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
    Which is no
t tomb enough and continent
    To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,
    My thoughts be blo
ody, or be nothing worth!            Exit.

Scene V.
Elsinore. A room in the Ca
stle.

Enter Horatio, Queen, and a Gentleman.

  Queen. I will not speak with her.
  Gent. She 
is importunate, indeed distract.
    Her mood will needs be pitied.
  Queen. What would she have?

  Gent. She speaks much of her father; says she hears
    There's tricks i' th' world, and hems, a
nd beats her heart;
    Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,
    That carry but hal
f sense. Her speech is nothing,
    Yet the unshaped use of it doth move
    The hearers to collec
tion; they aim at it,
    And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;
    Which, as her wink
s and nods and gestures yield them,
    Indeed would make one think there might be thought,
    Th
ough nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
  Hor. 'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew

    Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.
  Queen. Let her come in.
                       
                        [Exit Gentleman.]
    [Aside] To my sick soul (as sin's true nature is)
  
  Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.

                 Enter Ophelia distracted.

  Oph. Where is 
the beauteous Majesty of Denmark?
  Queen. How now, Ophelia?
  Oph. (sings)
         How should I
 your true-love know
           From another one?
         By his cockle bat and' staff
         
  And his sandal shoon.

  Queen. Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
  Oph. Say you? Nay, 
pray You mark.

    (Sings) He is dead and gone, lady,
              He is dead and gone;
      
      At his head a grass-green turf,
              At his heels a stone.

    O, ho!
  Queen. N
ay, but Ophelia-
  Oph. Pray you mark.

    (Sings) White his shroud as the mountain snow-

   
                 Enter King.

  Queen. Alas, look here, my lord!
  Oph. (Sings)
           Larde
d all with sweet flowers;
         Which bewept to the grave did not go
           With true-love 
showers.

  King. How do you, pretty lady?
  Oph. Well, God dild you! They say the owl was a bake
r's
daughter.
    Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be. God
be at
    your tab
le!
  King. Conceit upon her father.
  Oph. Pray let's have no words of this; but when they ask, y
ou
what
    it means, say you this:

    (Sings) To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,
          
    All in the morning bedtime,
            And I a maid at your window,
              To be your 
Valentine.

            Then up he rose and donn'd his clo'es
              And dupp'd the chambe
r door,
            Let in the maid, that out a maid
              Never departed more.

  King.
 Pretty Ophelia!
  Oph. Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't!

    [Sings] By Gis a
nd by Saint Charity,
              Alack, and fie for shame!
            Young men will do't if th
ey come to't
              By Cock, they are to blame.

            Quoth she, 'Before you tumble
d me,
              You promis'd me to wed.'

    He answers:

            'So would I 'a' done
, by yonder sun,
              An thou hadst not come to my bed.'

  King. How long hath she been
 thus?
  Oph. I hope all will be well. We must be patient; but I cannot
    choose but weep to thi
nk they would lay him i' th' cold
ground.
    My brother shall know of it; and so I thank you for 
your good
    counsel. Come, my coach! Good night, ladies. Good night,
sweet
    ladies. Good nig
ht, good night.                         Exit
  King. Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray 
you.
                                                 [Exit Horatio.]

    O, this is the poison 
of deep grief; it springs
    All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
    When sorrows 
come, they come not single spies.
    But in battalions! First, her father slain;
    Next, your s
on gone, and he most violent author
    Of his own just remove; the people muddied,
    Thick and 
and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers
    For good Polonius' death, and we have done but g
reenly
    In hugger-mugger to inter him; poor Ophelia
    Divided from herself and her fair judgm
ent,
    Without the which we are pictures or mere beasts;
    Last, and as much containing as all
 these,
    Her brother is in secret come from France;
    And wants not buzzers to infect his ear

    Feeds on his wonder, keep, himself in clouds,
    With pestilent speeches of his father's dea
th,
    Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
    Will nothing stick our person to arraign
    I
n ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
    Like to a murd'ring piece, in many places
    Give me
 superfluous death.                  A noise within.
  Queen. Alack, what noise is this?
  King. W
here are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.

                     Enter a Messenger.

    Wha
t is the matter?
  Mess. Save Yourself, my lord:
    The ocean, overpeering of his list,
    Eats
 not the flats with more impetuous haste
    Than Young Laertes, in a riotous head,
    O'erbears 
Your offices. The rabble call him lord;
    And, as the world were now but to begin,
    Antiquity
 forgot, custom not known,
    The ratifiers and props of every word,
    They cry 'Choose we! Lae
rtes shall be king!'
    Caps, hands, and tongues applaud it to the clouds,
    'Laertes shall be 
king! Laertes king!'
                                                 A noise within.
  Queen. How
 cheerfully on the false trail they cry!
    O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!
  King. Th
e doors are broke.

                    Enter Laertes with others.

  Laer. Where is this king?-
 Sirs, staid you all without.
  All. No, let's come in!
  Laer. I pray you give me leave.
  All. 
We will, we will!
  Laer. I thank you. Keep the door.      [Exeunt his Followers.]
    O thou vile
 king,
    Give me my father!
  Queen. Calmly, good Laertes.
  Laer. That drop of blood that's ca
lm proclaims me bastard;
    Cries cuckold to my father; brands the harlot
    Even here between t
he chaste unsmirched brows
    Of my true mother.
  King. What is the cause, Laertes,
    That th
y rebellion looks so giantlike?
    Let him go, Gertrude. Do not fear our person.
    There's such
 divinity doth hedge a king
    That treason can but peep to what it would,
    Acts little of his
 will. Tell me, Laertes,
    Why thou art thus incens'd. Let him go, Gertrude.
    Speak, man.
  
Laer. Where is my father?
  King. Dead.
  Queen. But not by him!
  King. Let him demand his fill.

  Laer. How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
    To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackes
t devil
    Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
    I dare damnation. To this point I st
and,
    That both the world, I give to negligence,
    Let come what comes; only I'll be reveng'd

    Most throughly for my father.
  King. Who shall stay you?
  Laer. My will, not all the world
!
    And for my means, I'll husband them so well
    They shall go far with little.
  King. Good
 Laertes,
    If you desire to know the certainty
    Of your dear father's death, is't writ in yo
ur revenge
    That sweepstake you will draw both friend and foe,
    Winner and loser?
  Laer. N
one but his enemies.
  King. Will you know them then?
  Laer. To his good friends thus wide I'll o
pe my arms
    And, like the kind life-rend'ring pelican,
    Repast them with my blood.
  King. 
Why, now You speak
    Like a good child and a true gentleman.
    That I am guiltless of your fat
her's death,
    And am most sensibly in grief for it,
    It shall as level to your judgment pier
ce
    As day does to your eye.
                              A noise within: 'Let her come in.'

  Laer. How now? What noise is that?

                      Enter Ophelia.

    O heat, dry up m
y brains! Tears seven times salt
    Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!
    By heaven, thy
 madness shall be paid by weight
    Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!
    Dear maid, k
ind sister, sweet Ophelia!
    O heavens! is't possible a young maid's wits
    Should be as morta
l as an old man's life?
    Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,
    It sends some preciou
s instance of itself
    After the thing it loves.

  Oph. (sings)
         They bore him barefa
c'd on the bier
           (Hey non nony, nony, hey nony)
         And in his grave rain'd many a 
tear.

    Fare you well, my dove!
  Laer. Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
    
It could not move thus.
  Oph. You must sing 'A-down a-down, and you call him a-down-a.'
O,
    h
ow the wheel becomes it! It is the false steward, that stole
his
    master's daughter.
  Laer. T
his nothing's more than matter.
  Oph. There's rosemary, that's for remembrance. Pray you, love,
 
   remember. And there is pansies, that's for thoughts.
  Laer. A document in madness! Thoughts and
 remembrance fitted.
  Oph. There's fennel for you, and columbines. There's rue for
you,
    and 
here's some for me. We may call it herb of grace o'
Sundays.
    O, you must wear your rue with a 
difference! There's a daisy.
I
    would give you some violets, but they wither'd all when my
fat
her
    died. They say he made a good end.

    [Sings] For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.

 
 Laer. Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,
    She turns to favour and to prettiness.
  
Oph. (sings)
         And will he not come again?
         And will he not come again?
          
 No, no, he is dead;
           Go to thy deathbed;
         He never will come again.

        
 His beard was as white as snow,
         All flaxen was his poll.
           He is gone, he is go
ne,
           And we cast away moan.
         God 'a'mercy on his soul!

    And of all Christi
an souls, I pray God. God b' wi' you.
Exit.
  Laer. Do you see this, O God?
  King. Laertes, I mu
st commune with your grief,
    Or you deny me right. Go but apart,
    Make choice of whom your w
isest friends you will,
    And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me.
    If by direct or b
y collateral hand
    They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,
    Our crown, our life, and
 all that we call ours,
    To you in satisfaction; but if not,
    Be you content to lend your pa
tience to us,
    And we shall jointly labour with your soul
    To give it due content.
  Laer. 
Let this be so.
    His means of death, his obscure funeral-
    No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o
'er his bones,
    No noble rite nor formal ostentation,-
    Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heav
en to earth,
    That I must call't in question.
  King. So you shall;
    And where th' offence 
is let the great axe fall.
    I pray you go with me.

selves too

grapple I
    boarded them.
 On the instant they got clear of our ship; so I

Scene VII.
Elsinore. Another r
oom in the Castle.

Enter King and Laertes.

  King. Now must your conscience my acquittance sea
l,
    And You must put me in your heart for friend,
    Sith you have heard, and with a knowing e
ar,
    That he which hath your noble father slain
    Pursued my life.
  Laer. It well appears. 
But tell me
    Why you proceeded not against these feats
    So crimeful and so capital in nature
,
    As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
    You mainly were stirr'd up.
  King. O, for 
two special reasons,
    Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,
    But yet to me they ar
e strong. The Queen his mother
    Lives almost by his looks; and for myself,-
    My virtue or my
 plague, be it either which,-
    She's so conjunctive to my life and soul
    That, as the star m
oves not but in his sphere,
    I could not but by her. The other motive
    Why to a public count
 I might not go
    Is the great love the general gender bear him,
    Who, dipping all his faults
 in their affection,
    Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
    Convert his gives 
to graces; so that my arrows,
    Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,
    Would have reverte
d to my bow again,
    And not where I had aim'd them.
  Laer. And so have I a noble father lost;

    A sister driven into desp'rate terms,
    Whose worth, if praises may go back again,
    Stoo
d challenger on mount of all the age
    For her perfections. But my revenge will come.
  King. Br
eak not your sleeps for that. You must not think
    That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
  
  That we can let our beard be shook with danger,
    And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear 
more.
    I lov'd your father, and we love ourself,
    And that, I hope, will teach you to imagin
e-

                 Enter a Messenger with letters.

    How now? What news?
  Mess. Letters, 
my lord, from Hamlet:
    This to your Majesty; this to the Queen.
  King. From Hamlet? Who brough
t them?
  Mess. Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not.
    They were given me by Claudio; he 
receiv'd them
    Of him that brought them.
  King. Laertes, you shall hear them.
    Leave us.

                                                 Exit Messenger.
    [Reads]'High and Mighty,-You s
hall know I am set naked on
your
    kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes;

    when I shall (first asking your pardon thereunto) recount the
    occasion of my sudden and m
ore strange return.
                                                     'HAMLET.'
    What should
 this mean? Are all the rest come back?
    Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?
  Laer. Know y
ou the hand?
  King. 'Tis Hamlet's character. 'Naked!'
    And in a postscript here, he says 'alon
e.'
    Can you advise me?
  Laer. I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come!
    It warms the v
ery sickness in my heart
    That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,
    'Thus didest thou.'

  King. If it be so, Laertes
    (As how should it be so? how otherwise?),
    Will you be rul'd 
by me?
  Laer. Ay my lord,
    So you will not o'errule me to a peace.
  King. To thine own peace
. If he be now return'd
    As checking at his voyage, and that he means
    No more to undertake 
it, I will work him
    To exploit now ripe in my device,
    Under the which he shall not choose 
but fall;
    And for his death no wind shall breathe
    But even his mother shall uncharge the p
ractice
    And call it accident.
  Laer. My lord, I will be rul'd;
    The rather, if you could 
devise it so
    That I might be the organ.
  King. It falls right.
    You have been talk'd of s
ince your travel much,
    And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality
    Wherein they say you sh
ine, Your sum of parts
    Did not together pluck such envy from him
    As did that one; and that
, in my regard,
    Of the unworthiest siege.
  Laer. What part is that, my lord?
  King. A very 
riband in the cap of youth-
    Yet needfull too; for youth no less becomes
    The light and care
less livery that it wears
    Than settled age his sables and his weeds,
    Importing health and 
graveness. Two months since
    Here was a gentleman of Normandy.
    I have seen myself, and serv
'd against, the French,
    And they can well on horseback; but this gallant
    Had witchcraft in
't. He grew unto his seat,
    And to such wondrous doing brought his horse
    As had he been inc
orps'd and demi-natur'd
    With the brave beast. So far he topp'd my thought
    That I, in forge
ry of shapes and tricks,
    Come short of what he did.
  Laer. A Norman was't?
  King. A Norman.

  Laer. Upon my life, Lamound.
  King. The very same.
  Laer. I know him well. He is the broach 
indeed
    And gem of all the nation.
  King. He made confession of you;
    And gave you such a 
masterly report
    For art and exercise in your defence,
    And for your rapier most especially,

    That he cried out 'twould be a sight indeed
    If one could match you. The scrimers of their
 nation
    He swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
    If you oppos'd them. Sir, this report
 of his
    Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
    That he could nothing do but wish and beg
   
 Your sudden coming o'er to play with you.
    Now, out of this-
  Laer. What out of this, my lord
?
  King. Laertes, was your father dear to you?
    Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
   
 A face without a heart,'
  Laer. Why ask you this?
  King. Not that I think you did not love your
 father;
    But that I know love is begun by time,
    And that I see, in passages of proof,
   
 Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
    There lives within the very flame of love
    A kind
 of wick or snuff that will abate it;
    And nothing is at a like goodness still;
    For goodnes
s, growing to a plurisy,
    Dies in his own too-much. That we would do,
    We should do when we 
would; for this 'would' changes,
    And hath abatements and delays as many
    As there are tongu
es, are hands, are accidents;
    And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
    That hurt
s by easing. But to the quick o' th' ulcer!
    Hamlet comes back. What would you undertake
    To
 show yourself your father's son in deed
    More than in words?
  Laer. To cut his throat i' th' 
church!
  King. No place indeed should murther sanctuarize;
    Revenge should have no bounds. But
, good Laertes,
    Will you do this? Keep close within your chamber.
    Hamlet return'd shall kn
ow you are come home.
    We'll put on those shall praise your excellence
    And set a double var
nish on the fame
    The Frenchman gave you; bring you in fine together
    And wager on your head
s. He, being remiss,
    Most generous, and free from all contriving,
    Will not peruse the foil
s; so that with ease,
    Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
    A sword unbated, and, in 
a pass of practice,
    Requite him for your father.
  Laer. I will do't!
    And for that purpos
e I'll anoint my sword.
    I bought an unction of a mountebank,
    So mortal that, but dip a kni
fe in it,
    Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
    Collected from all simples that have 
virtue
    Under the moon, can save the thing from death
    This is but scratch'd withal. I'll to
uch my point
    With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
    It may be death.
  King. 
Let's further think of this,
    Weigh what convenience both of time and means
    May fit us to o
ur shape. If this should fall,
    And that our drift look through our bad performance.
    'Twere
 better not assay'd. Therefore this project
    Should have a back or second, that might hold
    
If this did blast in proof. Soft! let me see.
    We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings-
    
I ha't!
    When in your motion you are hot and dry-
    As make your bouts more violent to that e
nd-
    And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepar'd him
    A chalice for the nonce; whereon b
ut sipping,
    If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
    Our purpose may hold there.- But st
ay, what noise,

                           Enter Queen.

    How now, sweet queen?
  Queen. On
e woe doth tread upon another's heel,
    So fast they follow. Your sister's drown'd, Laertes.
  L
aer. Drown'd! O, where?
  Queen. There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
    That shows his hoar l
eaves in the glassy stream.
    There with fantastic garlands did she come
    Of crowflowers, net
tles, daisies, and long purples,
    That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
    But our cold 
maids do dead men's fingers call them.
    There on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds
    Clamb
'ring to hang, an envious sliver broke,
    When down her weedy trophies and herself
    Fell in t
he weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide
    And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up;
    Whic
h time she chaunted snatches of old tunes,
    As one incapable of her own distress,
    Or like a
 creature native and indued
    Unto that element; but long it could not be
    Till that her garm
ents, heavy with their drink,
    Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay
    To muddy death
.
  Laer. Alas, then she is drown'd?
  Queen. Drown'd, drown'd.
  Laer. Too much of water hast th
ou, poor Ophelia,
    And therefore I forbid my tears; but yet
    It is our trick; nature her cus
tom holds,
    Let shame say what it will. When these are gone,
    The woman will be out. Adieu, 
my lord.
    I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze
    But that this folly douts it.     
                     Exit.
  King. Let's follow, Gertrude.
    How much I had to do to calm his ra
ge I
    Now fear I this will give it start again;
    Therefore let's follow.
                  
                                       Exeunt.

ACT V. Scene I.
Elsinore. A chu
rchyard.

Enter two Clowns, [with spades and pickaxes].

  Clown. Is she to be buried in Christi
an burial when she
wilfully
    seeks her own salvation?
  Other. I tell thee she is; therefore m
ake her grave straight.
    The crowner hath sate on her, and finds it Christian burial.
  Clown. 
How can that be, unless she drown'd herself in her own
    defence?
  Other. Why, 'tis found so.

  Clown. It must be se offendendo; it cannot be else. For here
lies
    the point: if I drown myse
lf wittingly, it argues an act; and
an
    act hath three branches-it is to act, to do, and to per
form;
    argal, she drown'd herself wittingly.
  Other. Nay, but hear you, Goodman Delver!
  Clo
wn. Give me leave. Here lies the water; good. Here stands
the
    man; good. If the man go to this
 water and drown himself, it
is,
    will he nill he, he goes- mark you that. But if the water
co
me to
    him and drown him, he drowns not himself. Argal, he that is
not
    guilty of his own d
eath shortens not his own life.
  Other. But is this law?
  Clown. Ay, marry, is't- crowner's ques
t law.
  Other. Will you ha' the truth an't? If this had not been a
    gentlewoman, she should ha
ve been buried out o' Christian
burial.
  Clown. Why, there thou say'st! And the more pity that gr
eat
folk
    should have count'nance in this world to drown or hang
themselves
    more than the
ir even-Christian. Come, my spade! There is no
    ancient gentlemen but gard'ners, ditchers, and g
rave-makers.
They
    hold up Adam's profession.
  Other. Was he a gentleman?
  Clown. 'A was th
e first that ever bore arms.
  Other. Why, he had none.
  Clown. What, art a heathen? How dost tho
u understand the
Scripture?
    The Scripture says Adam digg'd. Could he dig without arms?
I'll

    put another question to thee. If thou answerest me not to the
    purpose, confess thyself-
  
Other. Go to!
  Clown. What is he that builds stronger than either the mason,
the
    shipwright,
 or the carpenter?
  Other. The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand
    tenants.
  
Clown. I like thy wit well, in good faith. The gallows does
well.
    But how does it well? It doe
s well to those that do ill. Now,
    thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the

    church. Argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To't again,
come!
  Other. Who builds stronger
 than a mason, a shipwright, or a
    carpenter?
  Clown. Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
  Other. 
Marry, now I can tell!
  Clown. To't.
  Other. Mass, I cannot tell.

                 Enter Haml
et and Horatio afar off.

  Clown. Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull ass
will
  
  not mend his pace with beating; and when you are ask'd this
    question next, say 'a grave-maker
.' The houses he makes lasts
    till doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan; fetch me a stoup of
    l
iquor.
                                            [Exit Second Clown.]


                      
 [Clown digs and] sings.

       In youth when I did love, did love,
         Methought it was ve
ry sweet;
       To contract- O- the time for- a- my behove,
         O, methought there- a- was n
othing- a- meet.

  Ham. Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings
at
    grave-
making?
  Hor. Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.
  Ham. 'Tis e'en so. The hand of
 little employment hath the
daintier
    sense.
  Clown. (sings)
         But age with his steal
ing steps
           Hath clawed me in his clutch,
         And hath shipped me intil the land,
 
          As if I had never been such.
                                            [Throws up a sku
ll.]

  Ham. That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once. How
the
    knave jowls it to t
he ground,as if 'twere Cain's jawbone,
that
    did the first murther! This might be the pate of a

Politician,
    which this ass now o'erreaches; one that would circumvent
God,
    might it not
?
  Hor. It might, my lord.
  Ham. Or of a courtier, which could say 'Good morrow, sweet
lord!
 
   How dost thou, good lord?' This might be my Lord Such-a-one,
that
    prais'd my Lord Such-a-on
e's horse when he meant to beg it-
might
    it not?
  Hor. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Why, e'en so! an
d now my Lady Worm's, chapless, and
knock'd
    about the mazzard with a sexton's spade. Here's fi
ne
revolution,
    and we had the trick to see't. Did these bones cost no more
the
    breeding 
but to play at loggets with 'em? Mine ache to think
    on't.
  Clown. (Sings)
         A pickaxe
 and a spade, a spade,
           For and a shrouding sheet;
         O, a Pit of clay for to be m
ade
           For such a guest is meet.
                                      Throws up [another 
skull].

  Ham. There's another. Why may not that be the skull of a
lawyer?
    Where be his qui
ddits now, his quillets, his cases, his
tenures,
    and his tricks? Why does he suffer this rude 
knave now to
knock
    him about the sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell
him
    of hi
s action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be in's time
a
    great buyer of land, with his statu
tes, his recognizances,
his
    fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries. Is this the fine
of

    his fines, and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his
fine
    pate full of fine dirt? Wi
ll his vouchers vouch him no more
of
    his purchases, and double ones too, than the length and

breadth
    of a pair of indentures? The very conveyances of his lands
will
    scarcely lie in t
his box; and must th' inheritor himself have
no
    more, ha?
  Hor. Not a jot more, my lord.
  
Ham. Is not parchment made of sheepskins?
  Hor. Ay, my lord, And of calveskins too.
  Ham. They a
re sheep and calves which seek out assurance in
that. I
    will speak to this fellow. Whose grave
's this, sirrah?
  Clown. Mine, sir.

    [Sings] O, a pit of clay for to be made
              
For such a guest is meet.

  Ham. I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in't.
  Clown. You l
ie out on't, sir, and therefore 'tis not yours.
    For my part, I do not lie in't, yet it is mine.

  Ham. Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine. 'Tis
for
    the dead, not for the qu
ick; therefore thou liest.
  Clown. 'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away again from me to you.
  Ham
. What man dost thou dig it for?
  Clown. For no man, sir.
  Ham. What woman then?
  Clown. For n
one neither.
  Ham. Who is to be buried in't?
  Clown. One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her so
ul, she's
dead.
  Ham. How absolute the knave is! We must speak by the card, or
    equivocation 
will undo us. By the Lord, Horatio, this three
years
    I have taken note of it, the age is grown
 so picked that the
toe
    of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he
galls
    h
is kibe.- How long hast thou been a grave-maker?
  Clown. Of all the days i' th' year, I came to't 
that day that
our
    last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.
  Ham. How long is that since?
  Clo
wn. Cannot you tell that? Every fool can tell that. It was
the
    very day that young Hamlet was 
born- he that is mad, and sent
    into England.
  Ham. Ay, marry, why was be sent into England?

  Clown. Why, because 'a was mad. 'A shall recover his wits
there;
    or, if 'a do not, 'tis no g
reat matter there.
  Ham. Why?
  Clown. 'Twill not he seen in him there. There the men are as
mad
 as
    he.
  Ham. How came he mad?
  Clown. Very strangely, they say.
  Ham. How strangely?
  
Clown. Faith, e'en with losing his wits.
  Ham. Upon what ground?
  Clown. Why, here in Denmark. I
 have been sexton here, man and
boy
    thirty years.
  Ham. How long will a man lie i' th' earth
 ere he rot?
  Clown. Faith, if 'a be not rotten before 'a die (as we have
many
    pocky corses 
now-a-days that will scarce hold the laying in,
I
    will last you some eight year or nine year. 
A tanner will
last
    you nine year.
  Ham. Why he more than another?
  Clown. Why, sir, his hi
de is so tann'd with his trade that 'a
will
    keep out water a great while; and your water is a 
sore
decayer of
    your whoreson dead body. Here's a skull now. This skull hath
lien
    you i'
 th' earth three-and-twenty years.
  Ham. Whose was it?
  Clown. A whoreson, mad fellow's it was. 
Whose do you think it
was?
  Ham. Nay, I know not.
  Clown. A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! 
'A pour'd a flagon
of
    Rhenish on my head once. This same skull, sir, was Yorick's
    skull, 
the King's jester.
  Ham. This?
  Clown. E'en that.
  Ham. Let me see. [Takes the skull.] Alas, p
oor Yorick! I knew
him,
    Horatio. A fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy.
He
    
hath borne me on his back a thousand times. And now how
abhorred
    in my imagination it is! My g
orge rises at it. Here hung
those
    lips that I have kiss'd I know not how oft. Where be your
g
ibes
    now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment that
    were wont to set the ta
ble on a roar? Not one now, to mock
your
    own grinning? Quite chap- fall'n? Now get you to my l
ady's
    chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this
    favour she must come. Ma
ke her laugh at that. Prithee,
Horatio,
    tell me one thing.
  Hor. What's that, my lord?
  Ha
m. Dost thou think Alexander look'd o' this fashion i' th'
earth?
  Hor. E'en so.
  Ham. And smel
t so? Pah!
                                          [Puts down the skull.]
  Hor. E'en so, my lor
d.
  Ham. To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not
    imagination trace the noble du
st of Alexander till he find it
    stopping a bunghole?
  Hor. 'Twere to consider too curiously, 
to consider so.
  Ham. No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with
modesty
    enough, a
nd likelihood to lead it; as thus: Alexander died,
    Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth in
to dust; the dust
is
    earth; of earth we make loam; and why of that loam (whereto
he
    was 
converted) might they not stop a beer barrel?
    Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
    M
ight stop a hole to keep the wind away.
    O, that that earth which kept the world in awe
    Sho
uld patch a wall t' expel the winter's flaw!
    But soft! but soft! aside! Here comes the King-


    Enter [priests with] a coffin [in funeral procession], King,
             Queen, Laertes, with
 Lords attendant.]

    The Queen, the courtiers. Who is this they follow?
    And with such maim
ed rites? This doth betoken
    The corse they follow did with desp'rate hand
    Fordo it own lif
e. 'Twas of some estate.
    Couch we awhile, and mark.
                                         [
Retires with Horatio.]

  Laer. What ceremony else?
  Ham. That is Laertes,
    A very noble you
th. Mark.
  Laer. What ceremony else?
  Priest. Her obsequies have been as far enlarg'd
    As we
 have warranty. Her death was doubtful;
    And, but that great command o'ersways the order,
    S
he should in ground unsanctified have lodg'd
    Till the last trumpet. For charitable prayers,
  
  Shards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on her.
    Yet here she is allow'd her virgin rites
,
    Her maiden strewments, and the bringing home
    Of bell and burial.
  Laer. Must there no 
more be done?
  Priest. No more be done.
    We should profane the service of the dead
    To sin
g a requiem and such rest to her
    As to peace-parted souls.
  Laer. Lay her i' th' earth;
    
And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
    May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,
    A
 minist'ring angel shall my sister be
    When thou liest howling.
  Ham. What, the fair Ophelia?

  Queen. Sweets to the sweet! Farewell.
                                             [Scatters flo
wers.]
    I hop'd thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
    I thought thy bride-bed to have d
eck'd, sweet maid,
    And not have strew'd thy grave.
  Laer. O, treble woe
    Fall ten times t
reble on that cursed head
    Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
    Depriv'd thee of! Hol
d off the earth awhile,
    Till I have caught her once more in mine arms.
                       
                      Leaps in the grave.
    Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead
    Till 
of this flat a mountain you have made
    T' o'ertop old Pelion or the skyish head
    Of blue Oly
mpus.
  Ham. [comes forward] What is he whose grief
    Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of so
rrow
    Conjures the wand'ring stars, and makes them stand
    Like wonder-wounded hearers? This 
is I,
    Hamlet the Dane.                    [Leaps in after Laertes.
  Laer. The devil take thy 
soul!
                                            [Grapples with him].
  Ham. Thou pray'st not wel
l.
    I prithee take thy fingers from my throat;
    For, though I am not splenitive and rash,
 
   Yet have I in me something dangerous,
    Which let thy wisdom fear. Hold off thy hand!
  King.
 Pluck them asunder.
  Queen. Hamlet, Hamlet!
  All. Gentlemen!
  Hor. Good my lord, be quiet.
 
            [The Attendants part them, and they come out of the
                                   
                      grave.]
  Ham. Why, I will fight with him upon this theme
    Until my eyeli
ds will no longer wag.
  Queen. O my son, what theme?
  Ham. I lov'd Ophelia. Forty thousand broth
ers
    Could not (with all their quantity of love)
    Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?

  King. O, he is mad, Laertes.
  Queen. For love of God, forbear him!
  Ham. 'Swounds, show me w
hat thou't do.
    Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?
    Woo't drink up esi
ll? eat a crocodile?
    I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?
    To outface me with leaping i
n her grave?
    Be buried quick with her, and so will I.
    And if thou prate of mountains, let 
them throw
    Millions of acres on us, till our ground,
    Singeing his pate against the burning
 zone,
    Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
    I'll rant as well as thou.
  Queen. 
This is mere madness;
    And thus a while the fit will work on him.
    Anon, as patient as the f
emale dove
    When that her golden couplets are disclos'd,
    His silence will sit drooping.
  
Ham. Hear you, sir!
    What is the reason that you use me thus?
    I lov'd you ever. But it is n
o matter.
    Let Hercules himself do what he may,
    The cat will mew, and dog will have his day
.
Exit.
  King. I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.
                                       
            Exit Horatio.
    [To Laertes] Strengthen your patience in our last night's
speech.
 
   We'll put the matter to the present push.-
    Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.-
  
  This grave shall have a living monument.
    An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
    Till the
n in patience our proceeding be.
                                                         Exeunt.





Scene II.
Elsinore. A hall in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet and Horatio.

  Ham. So much fo
r this, sir; now shall you see the other.
    You do remember all the circumstance?
  Hor. Remembe
r it, my lord!
  Ham. Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting
    That would not let me slee
p. Methought I lay
    Worse than the mutinies in the bilboes. Rashly-
    And prais'd be rashness
 for it; let us know,
    Our indiscretion sometime serves us well
    When our deep plots do pall
; and that should learn us
    There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
    Rough-hew them how we 
will-
  Hor. That is most certain.
  Ham. Up from my cabin,
    My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in 
the dark
    Grop'd I to find out them; had my desire,
    Finger'd their packet, and in fine with
drew
    To mine own room again; making so bold
    (My fears forgetting manners) to unseal
    T
heir grand commission; where I found, Horatio
    (O royal knavery!), an exact command,
    Larded
 with many several sorts of reasons,
    Importing Denmark's health, and England's too,
    With, 
hoo! such bugs and goblins in my life-
    That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
    No, not t
o stay the finding of the axe,
    My head should be struck off.
  Hor. Is't possible?
  Ham. Her
e's the commission; read it at more leisure.
    But wilt thou bear me how I did proceed?
  Hor. I
 beseech you.
  Ham. Being thus benetted round with villanies,
    Or I could make a prologue to m
y brains,
    They had begun the play. I sat me down;
    Devis'd a new commission; wrote it fair.

    I once did hold it, as our statists do,
    A baseness to write fair, and labour'd much
    
How to forget that learning; but, sir, now
    It did me yeoman's service. Wilt thou know
    Th' 
effect of what I wrote?
  Hor. Ay, good my lord.
  Ham. An earnest conjuration from the King,
   
 As England was his faithful tributary,
    As love between them like the palm might flourish,
   
 As peace should still her wheaten garland wear
    And stand a comma 'tween their amities,
    An
d many such-like as's of great charge,
    That, on the view and knowing of these contents,
    Wi
thout debatement further, more or less,
    He should the bearers put to sudden death,
    Not shr
iving time allow'd.
  Hor. How was this seal'd?
  Ham. Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
   
 I had my father's signet in my purse,
    Which was the model of that Danish seal;
    Folded the
 writ up in the form of th' other,
    Subscrib'd it, gave't th' impression, plac'd it safely,
   
 The changeling never known. Now, the next day
    Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent

    Thou know'st already.
  Hor. So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.
  Ham. Why, man, they d
id make love to this employment!
    They are not near my conscience; their defeat
    Does by the
ir own insinuation grow.
    'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
    Between the pass and f
ell incensed points
    Of mighty opposites.
  Hor. Why, what a king is this!
  Ham. Does it not,
 thinks't thee, stand me now upon-
    He that hath kill'd my king, and whor'd my mother;
    Popp
'd in between th' election and my hopes;
    Thrown out his angle for my proper life,
    And with
 such coz'nage- is't not perfect conscience
    To quit him with this arm? And is't not to be damn'
d
    To let this canker of our nature come
    In further evil?
  Hor. It must be shortly known 
to him from England
    What is the issue of the business there.
  Ham. It will be short; the inte
rim is mine,
    And a man's life is no more than to say 'one.'
    But I am very sorry, good Hora
tio,
    That to Laertes I forgot myself,
    For by the image of my cause I see
    The portrait
ure of his. I'll court his favours.
    But sure the bravery of his grief did put me
    Into a to
w'ring passion.
  Hor. Peace! Who comes here?

                 Enter young Osric, a courtier.


  Osr. Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
  Ham. I humbly thank you, sir. [Aside to H
oratio] Dost know this
    waterfly?
  Hor. [aside to Hamlet] No, my good lord.
  Ham. [aside to 
Horatio] Thy state is the more gracious; for
'tis a
    vice to know him. He hath much land, and f
ertile. Let a beast
be
    lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at the king's mess.
'Tis
   
 a chough; but, as I say, spacious in the possession of dirt.

  Osr. Sweet lord, if your lordship
 were at leisure, I should
impart
    a thing to you from his Majesty.
  Ham. I will receive it, 
sir, with all diligence of spirit. Put
your
    bonnet to his right use. 'Tis for the head.
  Osr
. I thank your lordship, it is very hot.
  Ham. No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is norther
ly.
  Osr. It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
  Ham. But yet methinks it is very sultry and 
hot for my
complexion.
  Osr. Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry, as 'twere- I
cannot
    t
ell how. But, my lord, his Majesty bade me signify to you
that
    he has laid a great wager on yo
ur head. Sir, this is the
matter-
  Ham. I beseech you remember.
                           [Haml
et moves him to put on his hat.]
  Osr. Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here

is
    newly come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute
gentleman,
    full of most excellen
t differences, of very soft society and
    great showing. Indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is
 the
card
    or calendar of gentry; for you shall find in him the
continent of
    what part a 
gentleman would see.
  Ham. Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you; though, I

    know,
 to divide him inventorially would dozy th' arithmetic
of
    memory, and yet but yaw neither in r
espect of his quick sail.
    But, in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of
great
 
   article, and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as, to
make
    true diction of him, his 
semblable is his mirror, and who
else
    would trace him, his umbrage, nothing more.
  Osr. Your
 lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
  Ham. The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman 
in our
more
    rawer breath?
  Osr. Sir?
  Hor [aside to Hamlet] Is't not possible to understan
d in
another
    tongue? You will do't, sir, really.
  Ham. What imports the nomination of this g
entleman?
  Osr. Of Laertes?
  Hor. [aside] His purse is empty already. All's golden words are
  
  spent.
  Ham. Of him, sir.
  Osr. I know you are not ignorant-
  Ham. I would you did, sir; yet
, in faith, if you did, it would
not
    much approve me. Well, sir?
  Osr. You are not ignorant 
of what excellence Laertes is-
  Ham. I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in
 
   excellence; but to know a man well were to know himself.
  Osr. I mean, sir, for his weapon; but
 in the imputation laid on
him
    by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.
  Ham. What's his weapon
?
  Osr. Rapier and dagger.
  Ham. That's two of his weapons- but well.
  Osr. The King, sir, hat
h wager'd with him six Barbary horses;
    against the which he has impon'd, as I take it, six Fren
ch
    rapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers,
and
    so. Three of the car
riages, in faith, are very dear to fancy,
    very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages
, and of
    very liberal conceit.
  Ham. What call you the carriages?
  Hor. [aside to Hamlet] I
 knew you must be edified by the
margent
    ere you had done.
  Osr. The carriages, sir, are the
 hangers.
  Ham. The phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could
    carry cannon by ou
r sides. I would it might be hangers till
then.
    But on! Six Barbary horses against six French 
swords, their
    assigns, and three liberal-conceited carriages: that's the
French
    bet again
st the Danish. Why is this all impon'd, as you call
it?
  Osr. The King, sir, hath laid that, in a
 dozen passes between
    yourself and him, he shall not exceed you three hits; he hath
    laid o
n twelve for nine, and it would come to immediate trial
    if your lordship would vouchsafe the an
swer.
  Ham. How if I answer no?
  Osr. I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.

  Ham. Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please his
Majesty,
    it is the breathing time o
f day with me. Let the foils be
    brought, the gentleman willing, and the King hold his
purpose,

    I will win for him if I can; if not, I will gain nothing but
my
    shame and the odd hits.

  Osr. Shall I redeliver you e'en so?
  Ham. To this effect, sir, after what flourish your nature 
will.
  Osr. I commend my duty to your lordship.
  Ham. Yours, yours. [Exit Osric.] He does well t
o commend it
    himself; there are no tongues else for's turn.
  Hor. This lapwing runs away with
 the shell on his head.
  Ham. He did comply with his dug before he suck'd it. Thus has
he,
    a
nd many more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age
dotes
    on, only got the tune of the ti
me and outward habit of
encounter-
    a kind of yesty collection, which carries them through and

    through the most fann'd and winnowed opinions; and do but
blow
    them to their trial-the bu
bbles are out,

                            Enter a Lord.

  Lord. My lord, his Majesty commende
d him to you by young Osric,
who
    brings back to him, that you attend him in the hall. He sends

to
    know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you
will
    take longer time.

  Ham. I am constant to my purposes; they follow the King's
pleasure.
    If his fitness speaks, 
mine is ready; now or whensoever,
provided
    I be so able as now.
  Lord. The King and Queen an
d all are coming down.
  Ham. In happy time.
  Lord. The Queen desires you to use some gentle ente
rtainment to
    Laertes before you fall to play.
  Ham. She well instructs me.
                 
                                   [Exit Lord.]
  Hor. You will lose this wager, my lord.
  Ham. I
 do not think so. Since he went into France I have been
in
    continual practice. I shall win at 
the odds. But thou wouldst
not
    think how ill all's here about my heart. But it is no matter.

  Hor. Nay, good my lord -
  Ham. It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gaingiving as
    wo
uld perhaps trouble a woman.
  Hor. If your mind dislike anything, obey it. I will forestall
their

    repair hither and say you are not fit.
  Ham. Not a whit, we defy augury; there's a special p
rovidence
in
    the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not to come; if it
be
    not to come
, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will
come:
    the readiness is all. Since no man knows
 aught of what he
leaves,
    what is't to leave betimes? Let be.

    Enter King, Queen, Laerte
s, Osric, and Lords, with other
              Attendants with foils and gauntlets.
               
A table and flagons of wine on it.

  King. Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
     
               [The King puts Laertes' hand into Hamlet's.]
  Ham. Give me your pardon, sir. I have
 done you wrong;
    But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.
    This presence knows,
    And you m
ust needs have heard, how I am punish'd
    With sore distraction. What I have done
    That might
 your nature, honour, and exception
    Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
    Was't Haml
et wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet.
    If Hamlet from himself be taken away,
    And when he's not 
himself does wrong Laertes,
    Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
    Who does it, then? 
His madness. If't be so,
    Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
    His madness is poor Ham
let's enemy.
    Sir, in this audience,
    Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd evil
    Free me s
o far in your most generous thoughts
    That I have shot my arrow o'er the house
    And hurt my 
brother.
  Laer. I am satisfied in nature,
    Whose motive in this case should stir me most
    
To my revenge. But in my terms of honour
    I stand aloof, and will no reconcilement
    Till by 
some elder masters of known honour
    I have a voice and precedent of peace
    To keep my name u
ngor'd. But till that time
    I do receive your offer'd love like love,
    And will not wrong it
.
  Ham. I embrace it freely,
    And will this brother's wager frankly play.
    Give us the foi
ls. Come on.
  Laer. Come, one for me.
  Ham. I'll be your foil, Laertes. In mine ignorance
    Y
our skill shall, like a star i' th' darkest night,
    Stick fiery off indeed.
  Laer. You mock me
, sir.
  Ham. No, by this hand.
  King. Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
    You 
know the wager?
  Ham. Very well, my lord.
    Your Grace has laid the odds o' th' weaker side.
 
 King. I do not fear it, I have seen you both;
    But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds
.
  Laer. This is too heavy; let me see another.
  Ham. This likes me well. These foils have all a
 length?
                                                Prepare to play.
  Osr. Ay, my good lord.

  King. Set me the stoups of wine upon that table.
    If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
 
   Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
    Let all the battlements their ordnance fire;
    T
he King shall drink to Hamlet's better breath,
    And in the cup an union shall he throw
    Rich
er than that which four successive kings
    In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;
    A
nd let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
    The trumpet to the cannoneer without,
    The cannons 
to the heavens, the heaven to earth,
    'Now the King drinks to Hamlet.' Come, begin.
    And you
 the judges, bear a wary eye.
  Ham. Come on, sir.
  Laer. Come, my lord.                         
       They play.
  Ham. One.
  Laer. No.
  Ham. Judgment!
  Osr. A hit, a very palpable hit.
 
 Laer. Well, again!
  King. Stay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
    Here's to thy he
alth.
               [Drum; trumpets sound; a piece goes off [within].
    Give him the cup.
  Ha
m. I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile.
    Come. (They play.) Another hit. What say you?

  Laer. A touch, a touch; I do confess't.
  King. Our son shall win.
  Queen. He's fat, and scant 
of breath.
    Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows.
    The Queen carouses to thy fortune,
 Hamlet.
  Ham. Good madam!
  King. Gertrude, do not drink.
  Queen. I will, my lord; I pray you 
pardon me.          Drinks.
  King. [aside] It is the poison'd cup; it is too late.
  Ham. I dare 
not drink yet, madam; by-and-by.
  Queen. Come, let me wipe thy face.
  Laer. My lord, I'll hit hi
m now.
  King. I do not think't.
  Laer. [aside] And yet it is almost against my conscience.
  Ha
m. Come for the third, Laertes! You but dally.
    Pray you pass with your best violence;
    I am
 afeard you make a wanton of me.
  Laer. Say you so? Come on.                               Play.

  Osr. Nothing neither way.
  Laer. Have at you now!
                [Laertes wounds Hamlet; then]
 in scuffling, they
                    change rapiers, [and Hamlet wounds Laertes].
  King. Part 
them! They are incens'd.
  Ham. Nay come! again!                         The Queen falls.

  Osr.
 Look to the Queen there, ho!
  Hor. They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?
  Osr. How is't
, Laertes?
  Laer. Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric.
    I am justly kill'd with mine
 own treachery.
  Ham. How does the Queen?
  King. She sounds to see them bleed.
  Queen. No, no!
 the drink, the drink! O my dear Hamlet!
    The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.                 [
Dies.]
  Ham. O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd.
    Treachery! Seek it out.
                
                                [Laertes falls.]
  Laer. It is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain
;
    No medicine in the world can do thee good.
    In thee there is not half an hour of life.
 
   The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
    Unbated and envenom'd. The foul practice
    Hat
h turn'd itself on me. Lo, here I lie,
    Never to rise again. Thy mother's poison'd.
    I can n
o more. The King, the King's to blame.
  Ham. The point envenom'd too?
    Then, venom, to thy wor
k.                    Hurts the King.
  All. Treason! treason!
  King. O, yet defend me, friends! 
I am but hurt.
  Ham. Here, thou incestuous, murd'rous, damned Dane,
    Drink off this potion! Is
 thy union here?
    Follow my mother.                                 King dies.
  Laer. He is ju
stly serv'd.
    It is a poison temper'd by himself.
    Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamle
t.
    Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
    Nor thine on me!                        
               Dies.
  Ham. Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.
    I am dead, Horatio. Wr
etched queen, adieu!
    You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
    That are but mutes or 
audience to this act,
    Had I but time (as this fell sergeant, Death,
    Is strict in his arres
t) O, I could tell you-
    But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;
    Thou liv'st; report me and my c
ause aright
    To the unsatisfied.
  Hor. Never believe it.
    I am more an antique Roman than 
a Dane.
    Here's yet some liquor left.
  Ham. As th'art a man,
    Give me the cup. Let go! By 
heaven, I'll ha't.
    O good Horatio, what a wounded name
    (Things standing thus unknown) shal
l live behind me!
    If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,
    Absent thee from felicity awhil
e,
    And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
    To tell my story.         [March afar 
off, and shot within.]
    What warlike noise is this?
  Osr. Young Fortinbras, with conquest come
 from Poland,
    To the ambassadors of England gives
    This warlike volley.
  Ham. O, I die, H
oratio!
    The potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit.
    I cannot live to hear the news from E
ngland,
    But I do prophesy th' election lights
    On Fortinbras. He has my dying voice.
    S
o tell him, with th' occurrents, more and less,
    Which have solicited- the rest is silence.     
        Dies.
  Hor. Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince,
    And flights of angels
 sing thee to thy rest!
                                                 [March within.]
    Why d
oes the drum come hither?

    Enter Fortinbras and English Ambassadors, with Drum,
             
     Colours, and Attendants.

  Fort. Where is this sight?
  Hor. What is it you will see?
    
If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
  Fort. This quarry cries on havoc. O proud Death,
 
   What feast is toward in thine eternal cell
    That thou so many princes at a shot
    So blood
ily hast struck.
  Ambassador. The sight is dismal;
    And our affairs from England come too late
.
    The ears are senseless that should give us hearing
    To tell him his commandment is fulfil
l'd
    That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.
    Where should we have our thanks?
  Hor. N
ot from his mouth,
    Had it th' ability of life to thank you.
    He never gave commandment for 
their death.
    But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
    You from the Polack wars, and y
ou from England,
    Are here arriv'd, give order that these bodies
    High on a stage be placed 
to the view;
    And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
    How these things came about. So s
hall you hear
    Of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts;
    Of accidental judgments, casual slaugh
ters;
    Of deaths put on by cunning and forc'd cause;
    And, in this upshot, purposes mistook

    Fall'n on th' inventors' heads. All this can I
    Truly deliver.
  Fort. Let us haste to hea
r it,
    And call the noblest to the audience.
    For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.
   
 I have some rights of memory in this kingdom
    Which now, to claim my vantage doth invite me.
 
 Hor. Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
    And from his mouth whose voice will draw on mor
e.
    But let this same be presently perform'd,
    Even while men's minds are wild, lest more mi
schance
    On plots and errors happen.
  Fort. Let four captains
    Bear Hamlet like a soldier 
to the stage;
    For he was likely, had he been put on,
    To have prov'd most royally; and for 
his passage
    The soldiers' music and the rites of war
    Speak loudly for him.
    Take up th
e bodies. Such a sight as this
    Becomes the field but here shows much amiss.
    Go, bid the so
ldiers shoot.
            Exeunt marching; after the which a peal of ordnance
                    
                               are shot off.

ACT I. Scene I.
Elsinore. A platform before the Castle.

Enter two Sentinels-[first,] Francisco
, [who paces up and down
at his post; then] Bernardo, [who approaches him].

  Ber. Who's there?

  Fran. Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.
  Ber. Long live the King!
  Fran. Bernardo?

  Ber. He.
  Fran. You come most carefully upon your hour.
  Ber. 'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee
 to bed, Francisco.
  Fran. For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold,
    And I am sick at he
art.
  Ber. Have you had quiet guard?
  Fran. Not a mouse stirring.
  Ber. Well, good night.
   
 If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
    The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.

        
            Enter Horatio and Marcellus.

  Fran. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?
 
 Hor. Friends to this ground.
  Mar. And liegemen to the Dane.
  Fran. Give you good night.
  Mar
. O, farewell, honest soldier.
    Who hath reliev'd you?
  Fran. Bernardo hath my place.
    Giv
e you good night.                                   Exit.
  Mar. Holla, Bernardo!
  Ber. Say-
   
 What, is Horatio there ?
  Hor. A piece of him.
  Ber. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.

  Mar. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
  Ber. I have seen nothing.
  Mar. Horatio 
says 'tis but our fantasy,
    And will not let belief take hold of him
    Touching this dreaded 
sight, twice seen of us.
    Therefore I have entreated him along,
    With us to watch the minute
s of this night,
    That, if again this apparition come,
    He may approve our eyes and speak to
 it.
  Hor. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
  Ber. Sit down awhile,
    And let us once again assa
il your ears,
    That are so fortified against our story,
    What we two nights have seen.
  Ho
r. Well, sit we down,
    And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
  Ber. Last night of all,
    W
hen yond same star that's westward from the pole
    Had made his course t' illume that part of hea
ven
    Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
    The bell then beating one-

              
          Enter Ghost.

  Mar. Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!
  Ber. In the sa
me figure, like the King that's dead.
  Mar. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
  Ber. Look
s it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.
  Hor. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.
  
Ber. It would be spoke to.
  Mar. Question it, Horatio.
  Hor. What art thou that usurp'st this ti
me of night
    Together with that fair and warlike form
    In which the majesty of buried Denmar
k
    Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!
  Mar. It is offended.
  Ber. See, it s
talks away!
  Hor. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!
                                      
               Exit Ghost.
  Mar. 'Tis gone and will not answer.
  Ber. How now, Horatio? You trem
ble and look pale.
    Is not this something more than fantasy?
    What think you on't?
  Hor. B
efore my God, I might not this believe
    Without the sensible and true avouch
    Of mine own ey
es.
  Mar. Is it not like the King?
  Hor. As thou art to thyself.
    Such was the very armour h
e had on
    When he th' ambitious Norway combated.
    So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle
,
    He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
    'Tis strange.
  Mar. Thus twice before, and ju
mp at this dead hour,
    With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
  Hor. In what particular 
thought to work I know not;
    But, in the gross and scope of my opinion,
    This bodes some str
ange eruption to our state.
  Mar. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows,
    Why this sam
e strict and most observant watch
    So nightly toils the subject of the land,
    And why such d
aily cast of brazen cannon
    And foreign mart for implements of war;
    Why such impress of shi
pwrights, whose sore task
    Does not divide the Sunday from the week.
    What might be toward, 
that this sweaty haste
    Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day?
    Who is't that can 
inform me?
  Hor. That can I.
    At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
    Whose image e
ven but now appear'd to us,
    Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
    Thereto prick'd on 
by a most emulate pride,
    Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet
    (For so this sid
e of our known world esteem'd him)
    Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,
    Wel
l ratified by law and heraldry,
    Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
    Which he s
tood seiz'd of, to the conqueror;
    Against the which a moiety competent
    Was gaged by our ki
ng; which had return'd
    To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
    Had he been vanquisher, as, by th
e same cov'nant
    And carriage of the article design'd,
    His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young 
Fortinbras,
    Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
    Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and ther
e,
    Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
    For food and diet, to some enterprise
    That
 hath a stomach in't; which is no other,
    As it doth well appear unto our state,
    But to rec
over of us, by strong hand
    And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
    So by his father l
ost; and this, I take it,
    Is the main motive of our preparations,
    The source of this our w
atch, and the chief head
    Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
  Ber. I think it be no ot
her but e'en so.
    Well may it sort that this portentous figure
    Comes armed through our watc
h, so like the King
    That was and is the question of these wars.
  Hor. A mote it is to trouble
 the mind's eye.
    In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
    A little ere the mightiest Juli
us fell,
    The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead
    Did squeak and gibber in the Ro
man streets;
    As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood,
    Disasters in the sun; and th
e moist star
    Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
    Was sick almost to doomsday with
 eclipse.
    And even the like precurse of fierce events,
    As harbingers preceding still the f
ates
    And prologue to the omen coming on,
    Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
    
Unto our climature and countrymen.

                      Enter Ghost again.

    But soft! beho
ld! Lo, where it comes again!
    I'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!
             
                                  Spreads his arms.
    If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
 
   Speak to me.
    If there be any good thing to be done,
    That may to thee do ease, and, race
 to me,
    Speak to me.
    If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
    Which happily foreknowi
ng may avoid,
    O, speak!
    Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
    Extorted treasure in th
e womb of earth
    (For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death),
                        
                         The cock crows.
    Speak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!
  
Mar. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
  Hor. Do, if it will not stand.
  Ber. 'Tis here!
  
Hor. 'Tis here!
  Mar. 'Tis gone!
                                                     Exit Ghost.

    We do it wrong, being so majestical,
    To offer it the show of violence;
    For it is as 
the air, invulnerable,
    And our vain blows malicious mockery.
  Ber. It was about to speak, whe
n the cock crew.
  Hor. And then it started, like a guilty thing
    Upon a fearful summons. I hav
e heard
    The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
    Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding
 throat
    Awake the god of day; and at his warning,
    Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,

    Th' extravagant and erring spirit hies
    To his confine; and of the truth herein
    This 
present object made probation.
  Mar. It faded on the crowing of the cock.
    Some say that ever,
 'gainst that season comes
    Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
    The bird of dawning 
singeth all night long;
    And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,
    The nights are who
lesome, then no planets strike,
    No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
    So hallow'd
 and so gracious is the time.
  Hor. So have I heard and do in part believe it.
    But look, the 
morn, in russet mantle clad,
    Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.
    Break we our wa
tch up; and by my advice
    Let us impart what we have seen to-night
    Unto young Hamlet; for, 
upon my life,
    This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
    Do you consent we shall acquaint
 him with it,
    As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
    Let's do't, I pray; and I this mo
rning know
    Where we shall find him most conveniently.           Exeunt.




Scene II.
Els
inore. A room of state in the Castle.

Flourish. [Enter Claudius, King of Denmark, Gertrude the Qu
een,
Hamlet,
Polonius, Laertes and his sister Ophelia, [Voltemand, Cornelius,]
Lords Attendant.


  King. Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
    The memory be green, and that it us bef
itted
    To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom
    To be contracted in one brow of w
oe,
    Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
    That we with wisest sorrow think on him

    Together with remembrance of ourselves.
    Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
   
 Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,
    Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,
    Wit
h an auspicious, and a dropping eye,
    With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,
    In
 equal scale weighing delight and dole,
    Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd
    Your bett
er wisdoms, which have freely gone
    With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
    Now follow
s, that you know, young Fortinbras,
    Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
    Or thinking by o
ur late dear brother's death
    Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
    Colleagued with th
is dream of his advantage,
    He hath not fail'd to pester us with message
    Importing the surr
ender of those lands
    Lost by his father, with all bands of law,
    To our most valiant brothe
r. So much for him.
    Now for ourself and for this time of meeting.
    Thus much the business i
s: we have here writ
    To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,
    Who, impotent and bedrid, scarc
ely hears
    Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress
    His further gait herein, in that the l
evies,
    The lists, and full proportions are all made
    Out of his subject; and we here dispat
ch
    You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,
    For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,
 
   Giving to you no further personal power
    To business with the King, more than the scope
    
Of these dilated articles allow.            [Gives a paper.]
    Farewell, and let your haste comme
nd your duty.
  Cor., Volt. In that, and all things, will we show our duty.
  King. We doubt it no
thing. Heartily farewell.
                                 Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius.
    And
 now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
    You told us of some suit. What is't, Laertes?
    You
 cannot speak of reason to the Dane
    And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
    T
hat shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
    The head is not more native to the heart,
    The h
and more instrumental to the mouth,
    Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
    What woul
dst thou have, Laertes?
  Laer. My dread lord,
    Your leave and favour to return to France;
   
 From whence though willingly I came to Denmark
    To show my duty in your coronation,
    Yet no
w I must confess, that duty done,
    My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
    And bow 
them to your gracious leave and pardon.
  King. Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?

  Pol. He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
    By laboursome petition, and at last
    U
pon his will I seal'd my hard consent.
    I do beseech you give him leave to go.
  King. Take thy
 fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,
    And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
    But now, my 
cousin Hamlet, and my son-
  Ham. [aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind!
  King. How 
is it that the clouds still hang on you?
  Ham. Not so, my lord. I am too much i' th' sun.
  Queen
. Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
    And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
 
   Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
    Seek for thy noble father in the dust.
    Thou know's
t 'tis common. All that lives must die,
    Passing through nature to eternity.
  Ham. Ay, madam, 
it is common.
  Queen. If it be,
    Why seems it so particular with thee?
  Ham. Seems, madam, N
ay, it is. I know not 'seems.'
    'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
    Nor customary su
its of solemn black,
    Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,
    No, nor the fruitful river in
 the eye,
    Nor the dejected havior of the visage,
    Together with all forms, moods, shapes of
 grief,
    'That can denote me truly. These indeed seem,
    For they are actions that a man migh
t play;
    But I have that within which passeth show-
    These but the trappings and the suits o
f woe.
  King. 'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
    To give these mourning dutie
s to your father;
    But you must know, your father lost a father;
    That father lost, lost his
, and the survivor bound
    In filial obligation for some term
    To do obsequious sorrow. But t
o persever
    In obstinate condolement is a course
    Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grie
f;
    It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
    A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
    A
n understanding simple and unschool'd;
    For what we know must be, and is as common
    As any t
he most vulgar thing to sense,
    Why should we in our peevish opposition
    Take it to heart? F
ie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
    A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
    To reason most ab
surd, whose common theme
    Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
    From the first cor
se till he that died to-day,
    'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth
    This unprevaili
ng woe, and think of us
    As of a father; for let the world take note
    You are the most immed
iate to our throne,
    And with no less nobility of love
    Than that which dearest father bears
 his son
    Do I impart toward you. For your intent
    In going back to school in Wittenberg,
 
   It is most retrograde to our desire;
    And we beseech you, bend you to remain
    Here in the
 cheer and comfort of our eye,
    Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
  Queen. Let not th
y mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.
    I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.
  Ham. I sh
all in all my best obey you, madam.
  King. Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.
    Be as ourself
 in Denmark. Madam, come.
    This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet
    Sits smiling to my hea
rt; in grace whereof,
    No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day
    But the great cannon to 
the clouds shall tell,
    And the King's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,
    Respeaking earth
ly thunder. Come away.
                                Flourish. Exeunt all but Hamlet.
  Ham. O t
hat this too too solid flesh would melt,
    Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!
    Or that the 
Everlasting had not fix'd
    His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
    How weary, stale, 
flat, and unprofitable
    Seem to me all the uses of this world!
    Fie on't! ah, fie! 'Tis an u
nweeded garden
    That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
    Possess it merely. That
 it should come to this!
    But two months dead! Nay, not so much, not two.
    So excellent a ki
ng, that was to this
    Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
    That he might not beteem 
the winds of heaven
    Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
    Must I remember? Why, sh
e would hang on him
    As if increase of appetite had grown
    By what it fed on; and yet, withi
n a month-
    Let me not think on't! Frailty, thy name is woman!-
    A little month, or ere thos
e shoes were old
    With which she followed my poor father's body
    Like Niobe, all tears- why 
she, even she
    (O God! a beast that wants discourse of reason
    Would have mourn'd longer) ma
rried with my uncle;
    My father's brother, but no more like my father
    Than I to Hercules. W
ithin a month,
    Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
    Had left the flushing in her gal
led eyes,
    She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
    With such dexterity to incestuous she
ets!
    It is not, nor it cannot come to good.
    But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue!


          Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo.

  Hor. Hail to your lordship!
  Ham. I am 
glad to see you well.
    Horatio!- or I do forget myself.
  Hor. The same, my lord, and your poor
 servant ever.
  Ham. Sir, my good friend- I'll change that name with you.
    And what make you f
rom Wittenberg, Horatio?
    Marcellus?
  Mar. My good lord!
  Ham. I am very glad to see you.- [
To Bernardo] Good even, sir.-

    But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
  Hor. A truant 
disposition, good my lord.
  Ham. I would not hear your enemy say so,
    Nor shall you do my ear 
that violence
    To make it truster of your own report
    Against yourself. I know you are no tr
uant.
    But what is your affair in Elsinore?
    We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.

  Hor. My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
  Ham. I prithee do not mock me, fellow studen
t.
    I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
  Hor. Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.

  Ham. Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats
    Did coldly furnish forth the marriage t
ables.
    Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
    Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
   
 My father- methinks I see my father.
  Hor. O, where, my lord?
  Ham. In my mind's eye, Horatio.

  Hor. I saw him once. He was a goodly king.
  Ham. He was a man, take him for all in all.
    I 
shall not look upon his like again.
  Hor. My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
  Ham. Saw? who
?
  Hor. My lord, the King your father.
  Ham. The King my father?
  Hor. Season your admiration 
for a while
    With an attent ear, till I may deliver
    Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
 
   This marvel to you.
  Ham. For God's love let me hear!
  Hor. Two nights together had these gen
tlemen
    (Marcellus and Bernardo) on their watch
    In the dead vast and middle of the night
 
   Been thus encount'red. A figure like your father,
    Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
    App
ears before them and with solemn march
    Goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walk'd
    By 
their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
    Within his truncheon's length; whilst they distill'd

    Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
    Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
    In d
readful secrecy impart they did,
    And I with them the third night kept the watch;
    Where, as
 they had deliver'd, both in time,
    Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
    The ap
parition comes. I knew your father.
    These hands are not more like.
  Ham. But where was this?

  Mar. My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
  Ham. Did you not speak to it?
  Hor. My lor
d, I did;
    But answer made it none. Yet once methought
    It lifted up it head and did address

    Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
    But even then the morning cock crew loud,
    
And at the sound it shrunk in haste away
    And vanish'd from our sight.
  Ham. 'Tis very strange
.
  Hor. As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
    And we did think it writ down in our duty

    To let you know of it.
  Ham. Indeed, indeed, sirs. But this troubles me.
    Hold you the wa
tch to-night?
  Both [Mar. and Ber.] We do, my lord.
  Ham. Arm'd, say you?
  Both. Arm'd, my lor
d.
  Ham. From top to toe?
  Both. My lord, from head to foot.
  Ham. Then saw you not his face?

  Hor. O, yes, my lord! He wore his beaver up.
  Ham. What, look'd he frowningly.
  Hor. A counte
nance more in sorrow than in anger.
  Ham. Pale or red?
  Hor. Nay, very pale.
  Ham. And fix'd h
is eyes upon you?
  Hor. Most constantly.
  Ham. I would I had been there.
  Hor. It would have m
uch amaz'd you.
  Ham. Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
  Hor. While one with moderate haste 
might tell a hundred.
  Both. Longer, longer.
  Hor. Not when I saw't.
  Ham. His beard was grizz
led- no?
  Hor. It was, as I have seen it in his life,
    A sable silver'd.
  Ham. I will watch 
to-night.
    Perchance 'twill walk again.
  Hor. I warr'nt it will.
  Ham. If it assume my noble
 father's person,
    I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
    And bid me hold my peac
e. I pray you all,
    If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
    Let it be tenable in your si
lence still;
    And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
    Give it an understanding but no tongu
e.
    I will requite your loves. So, fare you well.
    Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twel
ve,
    I'll visit you.
  All. Our duty to your honour.
  Ham. Your loves, as mine to you. Farewe
ll.
                                        Exeunt [all but Hamlet].
    My father's spirit- in ar
ms? All is not well.
    I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come!
    Till then sit stil
l, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,
    Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
Exit.





Scene III.
Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius.

Enter Laertes and Ophelia.

  Lae
r. My necessaries are embark'd. Farewell.
    And, sister, as the winds give benefit
    And convo
y is assistant, do not sleep,
    But let me hear from you.
  Oph. Do you doubt that?
  Laer. For
 Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,
    Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood;
    A violet i
n the youth of primy nature,
    Forward, not permanent- sweet, not lasting;
    The perfume and s
uppliance of a minute;
    No more.
  Oph. No more but so?
  Laer. Think it no more.
    For nat
ure crescent does not grow alone
    In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,
    The inward s
ervice of the mind and soul
    Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
    And now no soil n
or cautel doth besmirch
    The virtue of his will; but you must fear,
    His greatness weigh'd, 
his will is not his own;
    For he himself is subject to his birth.
    He may not, as unvalued p
ersons do,
    Carve for himself, for on his choice depends
    The safety and health of this whol
e state,
    And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd
    Unto the voice and yielding of tha
t body
    Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
    It fits your wisdom so far to
 believe it
    As he in his particular act and place
    May give his saying deed; which is no fu
rther
    Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
    Then weigh what loss your honour may sus
tain
    If with too credent ear you list his songs,
    Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasu
re open
    To his unmast'red importunity.
    Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
    And
 keep you in the rear of your affection,
    Out of the shot and danger of desire.
    The charies
t maid is prodigal enough
    If she unmask her beauty to the moon.
    Virtue itself scopes not c
alumnious strokes.
    The canker galls the infants of the spring
    Too oft before their buttons
 be disclos'd,
    And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
    Contagious blastments are most immi
nent.
    Be wary then; best safety lies in fear.
    Youth to itself rebels, though none else nea
r.
  Oph. I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep
    As watchman to my heart. But, good my br
other,
    Do not as some ungracious pastors do,
    Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven,

    Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
    Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads

    And recks not his own rede.
  Laer. O, fear me not!

                       Enter Polonius.


    I stay too long. But here my father comes.
    A double blessing is a double grace;
    Oc
casion smiles upon a second leave.
  Pol. Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame!
    The wi
nd sits in the shoulder of your sail,
    And you are stay'd for. There- my blessing with thee!
  
  And these few precepts in thy memory
    Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
    N
or any unproportion'd thought his act.
    Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar:
    Those fri
ends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
    Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel;
    
But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
    Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware
   
 Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,
    Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee.
    Give 
every man thine ear, but few thy voice;
    Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
   
 Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
    But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
    For t
he apparel oft proclaims the man,
    And they in France of the best rank and station
    Are most
 select and generous, chief in that.
    Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
    For loan oft lose
s both itself and friend,
    And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
    This above all- to th
ine own self be true,
    And it must follow, as the night the day,
    Thou canst not then be fal
se to any man.
    Farewell. My blessing season this in thee!
  Laer. Most humbly do I take my lea
ve, my lord.
  Pol. The time invites you. Go, your servants tend.
  Laer. Farewell, Ophelia, and r
emember well
    What I have said to you.
  Oph. 'Tis in my memory lock'd,
    And you yourself s
hall keep the key of it.
  Laer. Farewell.                                          Exit.
  Pol. W
hat is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?
  Oph. So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.

  Pol. Marry, well bethought!
    'Tis told me he hath very oft of late
    Given private time to 
you, and you yourself
    Have of your audience been most free and bounteous.
    If it be so- as 
so 'tis put on me,
    And that in way of caution- I must tell you
    You do not understand yours
elf so clearly
    As it behooves my daughter and your honour.
    What is between you? Give me up
 the truth.
  Oph. He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
    Of his affection to me.
  Pol.
 Affection? Pooh! You speak like a green girl,
    Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
    Do 
you believe his tenders, as you call them?
  Oph. I do not know, my lord, what I should think,
  P
ol. Marry, I will teach you! Think yourself a baby
    That you have ta'en these tenders for true p
ay,
    Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,
    Or (not to crack the wind of the 
poor phrase,
    Running it thus) you'll tender me a fool.
  Oph. My lord, he hath importun'd me w
ith love
    In honourable fashion.
  Pol. Ay, fashion you may call it. Go to, go to!
  Oph. And 
hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
    With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
  Pol.
 Ay, springes to catch woodcocks! I do know,
    When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
    L
ends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter,
    Giving more light than heat, extinct in both
   
 Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
    You must not take for fire. From this time
    Be s
omething scanter of your maiden presence.
    Set your entreatments at a higher rate
    Than a co
mmand to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
    Believe so much in him, that he is young,
    And with a lar
ger tether may he walk
    Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia,
    Do not believe his vows; fo
r they are brokers,
    Not of that dye which their investments show,
    But mere implorators of 
unholy suits,
    Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
    The better to beguile. This is fo
r all:
    I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth
    Have you so slander any moment le
isure
    As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
    Look to't, I charge you. Come your wa
ys.
  Oph. I shall obey, my lord.
                                                         Exeunt.





Scene IV.
Elsinore. The platform before the Castle.

Enter Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcell
us.

  Ham. The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
  Hor. It is a nipping and an eager air.
  
Ham. What hour now?
  Hor. I think it lacks of twelve.
  Mar. No, it is struck.
  Hor. Indeed? I 
heard it not. It then draws near the season
    Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
        
           A flourish of trumpets, and two pieces go off.
    What does this mean, my lord?
  Ham.
 The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
    Keeps wassail, and the swagg'ring upspring re
els,
    And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
    The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray 
out
    The triumph of his pledge.
  Hor. Is it a custom?
  Ham. Ay, marry, is't;
    But to my 
mind, though I am native here
    And to the manner born, it is a custom
    More honour'd in the 
breach than the observance.
    This heavy-headed revel east and west
    Makes us traduc'd and ta
x'd of other nations;
    They clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase
    Soil our addition; an
d indeed it takes
    From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
    The pith and marrow o
f our attribute.
    So oft it chances in particular men
    That, for some vicious mole of nature
 in them,
    As in their birth,- wherein they are not guilty,
    Since nature cannot choose his 
origin,-
    By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
    Oft breaking down the pales and forts of re
ason,
    Or by some habit that too much o'erleavens
    The form of plausive manners, that these 
men
    Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
    Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,
 
   Their virtues else- be they as pure as grace,
    As infinite as man may undergo-
    Shall in 
the general censure take corruption
    From that particular fault. The dram of e'il
    Doth all 
the noble substance often dout To his own scandal.

                         Enter Ghost.

  Hor
. Look, my lord, it comes!
  Ham. Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
    Be thou a spirit of
 health or goblin damn'd,
    Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
    Be thy int
ents wicked or charitable,
    Thou com'st in such a questionable shape
    That I will speak to t
hee. I'll call thee Hamlet,
    King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me?
    Let me not burst in ig
norance, but tell
    Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,
    Have burst their cerements; w
hy the sepulchre
    Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
    Hath op'd his ponderous and marble j
aws
    To cast thee up again. What may this mean
    That thou, dead corse, again in complete ste
el,
    Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
    Making night hideous, and we fools of nature

    So horridly to shake our disposition
    With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
    Sa
y, why is this? wherefore? What should we do?
                                           Ghost beck
ons Hamlet.
  Hor. It beckons you to go away with it,
    As if it some impartment did desire
   
 To you alone.
  Mar. Look with what courteous action
    It waves you to a more removed ground.

    But do not go with it!
  Hor. No, by no means!
  Ham. It will not speak. Then will I follow it
.
  Hor. Do not, my lord!
  Ham. Why, what should be the fear?
    I do not set my life at a pin'
s fee;
    And for my soul, what can it do to that,
    Being a thing immortal as itself?
    It 
waves me forth again. I'll follow it.
  Hor. What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
    O
r to the dreadful summit of the cliff
    That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
    And there a
ssume some other, horrible form
    Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
    And draw yo
u into madness? Think of it.
    The very place puts toys of desperation,
    Without more motive,
 into every brain
    That looks so many fadoms to the sea
    And hears it roar beneath.
  Ham. 
It waves me still.
    Go on. I'll follow thee.
  Mar. You shall not go, my lord.
  Ham. Hold off
 your hands!
  Hor. Be rul'd. You shall not go.
  Ham. My fate cries out
    And makes each petty
 artire in this body
    As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
                                    
            [Ghost beckons.]

    Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
    By heaven, I'll ma
ke a ghost of him that lets me!-
    I say, away!- Go on. I'll follow thee.
                      
                  Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet.
  Hor. He waxes desperate with imagination.
  Mar. Let'
s follow. 'Tis not fit thus to obey him.
  Hor. Have after. To what issue will this come?
  Mar. S
omething is rotten in the state of Denmark.
  Hor. Heaven will direct it.
  Mar. Nay, let's follow
 him.
                                                         Exeunt.




Scene V.
Elsinore.
 The Castle. Another part of the fortifications.

Enter Ghost and Hamlet.

  Ham. Whither wilt t
hou lead me? Speak! I'll go no further.
  Ghost. Mark me.
  Ham. I will.
  Ghost. My hour is almo
st come,
    When I to sulph'rous and tormenting flames
    Must render up myself.
  Ham. Alas, p
oor ghost!
  Ghost. Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
    To what I shall unfold.
  Ham. 
Speak. I am bound to hear.
  Ghost. So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
  Ham. What?
  
Ghost. I am thy father's spirit,
    Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
    And for the 
day confin'd to fast in fires,
    Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
    Are burnt an
d purg'd away. But that I am forbid
    To tell the secrets of my prison house,
    I could a tale
 unfold whose lightest word
    Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
    Make thy two
 eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
    Thy knotted and combined locks to part,
    And e
ach particular hair to stand on end
    Like quills upon the fretful porcupine.
    But this etern
al blazon must not be
    To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
    If thou didst ever 
thy dear father love-
  Ham. O God!
  Ghost. Revenge his foul and most unnatural murther.
  Ham. 
Murther?
  Ghost. Murther most foul, as in the best it is;
    But this most foul, strange, and un
natural.
  Ham. Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
    As meditation or the thoughts 
of love,
    May sweep to my revenge.
  Ghost. I find thee apt;
    And duller shouldst thou be t
han the fat weed
    That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
    Wouldst thou not stir in this. N
ow, Hamlet, hear.
    'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
    A serpent stung me. So the 
whole ear of Denmark
    Is by a forged process of my death
    Rankly abus'd. But know, thou nobl
e youth,
    The serpent that did sting thy father's life
    Now wears his crown.
  Ham. O my pr
ophetic soul!
    My uncle?
  Ghost. Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
    With witchcr
aft of his wit, with traitorous gifts-
    O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
    So to s
educe!- won to his shameful lust
    The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.
    O Hamlet, wha
t a falling-off was there,
    From me, whose love was of that dignity
    That it went hand in ha
nd even with the vow
    I made to her in marriage, and to decline
    Upon a wretch whose natural
 gifts were poor
    To those of mine!
    But virtue, as it never will be mov'd,
    Though lewd
ness court it in a shape of heaven,
    So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
    Will sate i
tself in a celestial bed
    And prey on garbage.
    But soft! methinks I scent the morning air.

    Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
    My custom always of the afternoon,
    Upon 
my secure hour thy uncle stole,
    With juice of cursed hebona in a vial,
    And in the porches 
of my ears did pour
    The leperous distilment; whose effect
    Holds such an enmity with blood 
of man
    That swift as quicksilver it courses through
    The natural gates and alleys of the bo
dy,
    And with a sudden vigour it doth posset
    And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
   
 The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine;
    And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
    Mos
t lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust
    All my smooth body.
    Thus was I, sleeping, by a
 brother's hand
    Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd;
    Cut off even in the bloss
oms of my sin,
    Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd,
    No reckoning made, but sent to my accou
nt
    With all my imperfections on my head.
  Ham. O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
  Gh
ost. If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.
    Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
    A couch
 for luxury and damned incest.
    But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
    Taint not thy mind, 
nor let thy soul contrive
    Against thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven,
    And to those thor
ns that in her bosom lodge
    To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once.
    The glowworm sh
ows the matin to be near
    And gins to pale his uneffectual fire.
    Adieu, adieu, adieu! Remem
ber me.                      Exit.

  Ham. O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?
    And 
shall I couple hell? Hold, hold, my heart!
    And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
    But b
ear me stiffly up. Remember thee?
    Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
    In this d
istracted globe. Remember thee?
    Yea, from the table of my memory
    I'll wipe away all trivia
l fond records,
    All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past
    That youth and observatio
n copied there,
    And thy commandment all alone shall live
    Within the book and volume of my 
brain,
    Unmix'd with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!
    O most pernicious woman!
    O villain,
 villain, smiling, damned villain!
    My tables! Meet it is I set it down
    That one may smile,
 and smile, and be a villain;
    At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark.        [Writes.]
   
 So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word:
    It is 'Adieu, adieu! Remember me.'
    I have sworn
't.
  Hor. (within) My lord, my lord!

                   Enter Horatio and Marcellus.

  Mar. 
Lord Hamlet!
  Hor. Heaven secure him!
  Ham. So be it!
  Mar. Illo, ho, ho, my lord!
  Ham. Hil
lo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.
  Mar. How is't, my noble lord?
  Hor. What news, my lord?
  M
ar. O, wonderful!
  Hor. Good my lord, tell it.
  Ham. No, you will reveal it.
  Hor. Not I, my l
ord, by heaven!
  Mar. Nor I, my lord.
  Ham. How say you then? Would heart of man once think it?

    But you'll be secret?
  Both. Ay, by heaven, my lord.
  Ham. There's neer a villain dwelling 
in all Denmark
    But he's an arrant knave.
  Hor. There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the g
rave
    To tell us this.
  Ham. Why, right! You are in the right!
    And so, without more circu
mstance at all,
    I hold it fit that we shake hands and part;
    You, as your business and desi
res shall point you,
    For every man hath business and desire,
    Such as it is; and for my own
 poor part,
    Look you, I'll go pray.
  Hor. These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
  
Ham. I am sorry they offend you, heartily;
    Yes, faith, heartily.
  Hor. There's no offence, my
 lord.
  Ham. Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
    And much offence too. Touching thi
s vision here,
    It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.
    For your desire to know what i
s between us,
    O'ermaster't as you may. And now, good friends,
    As you are friends, scholars
, and soldiers,
    Give me one poor request.
  Hor. What is't, my lord? We will.
  Ham. Never ma
ke known what you have seen to-night.
  Both. My lord, we will not.
  Ham. Nay, but swear't.
  Ho
r. In faith,
    My lord, not I.
  Mar. Nor I, my lord- in faith.
  Ham. Upon my sword.
  Mar. W
e have sworn, my lord, already.
  Ham. Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.

                 Ghost cri
es under the stage.

  Ghost. Swear.
  Ham. Aha boy, say'st thou so? Art thou there, truepenny?

    Come on! You hear this fellow in the cellarage.
    Consent to swear.
  Hor. Propose the oath,
 my lord.
  Ham. Never to speak of this that you have seen.
    Swear by my sword.
  Ghost. [bene
ath] Swear.
  Ham. Hic et ubique? Then we'll shift our ground.
    Come hither, gentlemen,
    An
d lay your hands again upon my sword.
    Never to speak of this that you have heard:
    Swear by
 my sword.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear by his sword.
  Ham. Well said, old mole! Canst work i' th' ea
rth so fast?
    A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends."
  Hor. O day and night, but thi
s is wondrous strange!
  Ham. And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
    There are more thin
gs in heaven and earth, Horatio,
    Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
    But come!
    Her
e, as before, never, so help you mercy,
    How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself
    (As I perc
hance hereafter shall think meet
    To put an antic disposition on),
    That you, at such times 
seeing me, never shall,
    With arms encumb'red thus, or this head-shake,
    Or by pronouncing o
f some doubtful phrase,
    As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'
    Or 'If we
 list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'
    Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
    Th
at you know aught of me- this is not to do,
    So grace and mercy at your most need help you,
   
 Swear.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
                                                   [They swear.]

  Ham. Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! So, gentlemen,
    With all my love I do commend me to you;

    And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
    May do t' express his love and friending to you,
    
God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;
    And still your fingers on your lips, I pray
.
    The time is out of joint. O cursed spite
    That ever I was born to set it right!
    Nay,
 come, let's go together.
                                                         Exeunt.

Act II. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius.

Enter Polonius and Reyn
aldo.

  Pol. Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
  Rey. I will, my lord.
  Pol. You 
shall do marvell's wisely, good Reynaldo,
    Before You visit him, to make inquire
    Of his beh
aviour.
  Rey. My lord, I did intend it.
  Pol. Marry, well said, very well said. Look you, sir,

    Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
    And how, and who, what means, and where they k
eep,
    What company, at what expense; and finding
    By this encompassment and drift of questio
n
    That they do know my son, come you more nearer
    Than your particular demands will touch i
t.
    Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
    As thus, 'I know his father and his
 friends,
    And in part him.' Do you mark this, Reynaldo?
  Rey. Ay, very well, my lord.
  Pol.
 'And in part him, but,' you may say, 'not well.
    But if't be he I mean, he's very wild
    Add
icted so and so'; and there put on him
    What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
    As m
ay dishonour him- take heed of that;
    But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips
    As are c
ompanions noted and most known
    To youth and liberty.
  Rey. As gaming, my lord.
  Pol. Ay, or
 drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
    Drabbing. You may go so far.
  Rey. My lord, that w
ould dishonour him.
  Pol. Faith, no, as you may season it in the charge.
    You must not put ano
ther scandal on him,
    That he is open to incontinency.
    That's not my meaning. But breathe h
is faults so quaintly
    That they may seem the taints of liberty,
    The flash and outbreak of 
a fiery mind,
    A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
    Of general assault.
  Rey. But, my good 
lord-
  Pol. Wherefore should you do this?
  Rey. Ay, my lord,
    I would know that.
  Pol. Mar
ry, sir, here's my drift,
    And I believe it is a fetch of warrant.
    You laying these slight 
sullies on my son
    As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' th' working,
    Mark you,
    Your pa
rty in converse, him you would sound,
    Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
    The youth
 you breathe of guilty, be assur'd
    He closes with you in this consequence:
    'Good sir,' or 
so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman'-
    According to the phrase or the addition
    Of man and countr
y-
  Rey. Very good, my lord.
  Pol. And then, sir, does 'a this- 'a does- What was I about to
sa
y?
    By the mass, I was about to say something! Where did I leave?
  Rey. At 'closes in the cons
equence,' at 'friend or so,' and
    gentleman.'
  Pol. At 'closes in the consequence'- Ay, marry!

    He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman.
    I saw him yesterday, or t'other day,
    Or then,
 or then, with such or such; and, as you say,
    There was 'a gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;

    There falling out at tennis'; or perchance,
    'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'
    Vi
delicet, a brothel, or so forth.
    See you now-
    Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of tr
uth;
    And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
    With windlasses and with assays of bias,
    
By indirections find directions out.
    So, by my former lecture and advice,
    Shall you my son
. You have me, have you not?
  Rey. My lord, I have.
  Pol. God b' wi' ye, fare ye well!
  Rey. G
ood my lord!                                    [Going.]
  Pol. Observe his inclination in yourself
.
  Rey. I shall, my lord.
  Pol. And let him ply his music.
  Rey. Well, my lord.
  Pol. Farewe
ll!
                                                  Exit Reynaldo.

                       Ente
r Ophelia.

    How now, Ophelia? What's the matter?
  Oph. O my lord, my lord, I have been so af
frighted!
  Pol. With what, i' th' name of God?
  Oph. My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
   
 Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac'd,
    No hat upon his head, his stockings foul'd,
    U
ngart'red, and down-gyved to his ankle;
    Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,
    
And with a look so piteous in purport
    As if he had been loosed out of hell
    To speak of hor
rors- he comes before me.
  Pol. Mad for thy love?
  Oph. My lord, I do not know,
    But truly I
 do fear it.
  Pol. What said he?
  Oph. He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
    Then goes 
he to the length of all his arm,
    And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
    He falls to 
such perusal of my face
    As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so.
    At last, a little shaking 
of mine arm,
    And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
    He rais'd a sigh so piteous and 
profound
    As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
    And end his being. That done, he lets me g
o,
    And with his head over his shoulder turn'd
    He seem'd to find his way without his eyes,

    For out o' doors he went without their help
    And to the last bended their light on me.
  P
ol. Come, go with me. I will go seek the King.
    This is the very ecstasy of love,
    Whose vio
lent property fordoes itself
    And leads the will to desperate undertakings
    As oft as any pa
ssion under heaven
    That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
    What, have you given him any
 hard words of late?
  Oph. No, my good lord; but, as you did command,
    I did repel his letters
 and denied
    His access to me.
  Pol. That hath made him mad.
    I am sorry that with better 
heed and judgment
    I had not quoted him. I fear'd he did but trifle
    And meant to wrack thee
; but beshrew my jealousy!
    By heaven, it is as proper to our age
    To cast beyond ourselves 
in our opinions
    As it is common for the younger sort
    To lack discretion. Come, go we to th
e King.
    This must be known; which, being kept close, might move
    More grief to hide than ha
te to utter love.
    Come.
                                                         Exeunt.

Sc
ene II.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Flourish. [Enter King and Queen, Rosencrantz and Guilden
stern,
cum aliis.

  King. Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
    Moreover that we much
 did long to see you,
    The need we have to use you did provoke
    Our hasty sending. Something
 have you heard
    Of Hamlet's transformation. So I call it,
    Sith nor th' exterior nor the in
ward man
    Resembles that it was. What it should be,
    More than his father's death, that thus
 hath put him
    So much from th' understanding of himself,
    I cannot dream of. I entreat you 
both
    That, being of so young days brought up with him,
    And since so neighbour'd to his you
th and haviour,
    That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
    Some little time; so by you
r companies
    To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather
    So much as from occasion you may gl
ean,
    Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus
    That, open'd, lies within our remedy.

  Queen. Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,
    And sure I am two men there are not living

    To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
    To show us so much gentry and good will
 
   As to expend your time with us awhile
    For the supply and profit of our hope,
    Your visit
ation shall receive such thanks
    As fits a king's remembrance.
  Ros. Both your Majesties
    
Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
    Put your dread pleasures more into command
    T
han to entreaty.
  Guil. But we both obey,
    And here give up ourselves, in the full bent,
    
To lay our service freely at your feet,
    To be commanded.
  King. Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentl
e Guildenstern.
  Queen. Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz.
    And I beseech you instan
tly to visit
    My too much changed son.- Go, some of you,
    And bring these gentlemen where Ha
mlet is.
  Guil. Heavens make our presence and our practices
    Pleasant and helpful to him!
  Q
ueen. Ay, amen!
                 Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, [with some
                 
                                   Attendants].

                         Enter Polonius.

  Pol
. Th' ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
    Are joyfully return'd.
  King. Thou still hast be
en the father of good news.
  Pol. Have I, my lord? Assure you, my good liege,
    I hold my duty 
as I hold my soul,
    Both to my God and to my gracious king;
    And I do think- or else this br
ain of mine
    Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
    As it hath us'd to do- that I have found

    The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
  King. O, speak of that! That do I long to hear.
  Pol. 
Give first admittance to th' ambassadors.
    My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
  Ki
ng. Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
                                                [E
xit Polonius.]
    He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found
    The head and source of all you
r son's distemper.
  Queen. I doubt it is no other but the main,
    His father's death and our o'
erhasty marriage.
  King. Well, we shall sift him.

              Enter Polonius, Voltemand, and 
Cornelius.

    Welcome, my good friends.
    Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?
  Vo
lt. Most fair return of greetings and desires.
    Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
    His
 nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
    To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack,
    But better
 look'd into, he truly found
    It was against your Highness; whereat griev'd,
    That so his si
ckness, age, and impotence
    Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
    On Fortinbras; whi
ch he, in brief, obeys,
    Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,
    Makes vow before his un
cle never more
    To give th' assay of arms against your Majesty.
    Whereon old Norway, overcom
e with joy,
    Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee
    And his commission to employ tho
se soldiers,
    So levied as before, against the Polack;
    With an entreaty, herein further sho
wn,
                                                [Gives a paper.]
    That it might please you 
to give quiet pass
    Through your dominions for this enterprise,
    On such regards of safety a
nd allowance
    As therein are set down.
  King. It likes us well;
    And at our more consider'
d time we'll read,
    Answer, and think upon this business.
    Meantime we thank you for your we
ll-took labour.
    Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together.
    Most welcome home!        
               Exeunt Ambassadors.
  Pol. This business is well ended.
    My liege, and madam, to
 expostulate
    What majesty should be, what duty is,
    Why day is day, night is night, and tim
e is time.
    Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time.
    Therefore, since brevity is the
 soul of wit,
    And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
    I will be brief. Your nobl
e son is mad.
    Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,
    What is't but to be nothing else
 but mad?
    But let that go.
  Queen. More matter, with less art.
  Pol. Madam, I swear I use n
o art at all.
    That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
    And pity 'tis 'tis true. A f
oolish figure!
    But farewell it, for I will use no art.
    Mad let us grant him then. And now 
remains
    That we find out the cause of this effect-
    Or rather say, the cause of this defect
,
    For this effect defective comes by cause.
    Thus it remains, and the remainder thus.
    
Perpend.
    I have a daughter (have while she is mine),
    Who in her duty and obedience, mark,

    Hath given me this. Now gather, and surmise.
                                             [Rea
ds] the letter.
    'To the celestial, and my soul's idol, the most beautified
      Ophelia,'-


    That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is a vile
      phrase.
    But you shall h
ear. Thus:
                                                        [Reads.]
    'In her excellent 
white bosom, these, &c.'
  Queen. Came this from Hamlet to her?
  Pol. Good madam, stay awhile. I 
will be faithful.     [Reads.]


          'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
            Doubt tha
t the sun doth move;
          Doubt truth to be a liar;
            But never doubt I love.
    
  'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers; I have not art
to
    reckon my groans; but that I l
ove thee best, O most best,
believe
    it. Adieu.
      'Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst 
this machine is to
him,

HAMLET.'

    This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me;
    And 
more above, hath his solicitings,
    As they fell out by time, by means, and place,
    All given
 to mine ear.
  King. But how hath she
    Receiv'd his love?
  Pol. What do you think of me?
  
King. As of a man faithful and honourable.
  Pol. I would fain prove so. But what might you think,

    When I had seen this hot love on the wing
    (As I perceiv'd it, I must tell you that,
    B
efore my daughter told me), what might you,
    Or my dear Majesty your queen here, think,
    If 
I had play'd the desk or table book,
    Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
    Or look'd
 upon this love with idle sight?
    What might you think? No, I went round to work
    And my you
ng mistress thus I did bespeak:
    'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star.
    This must not b
e.' And then I prescripts gave her,
    That she should lock herself from his resort,
    Admit no
 messengers, receive no tokens.
    Which done, she took the fruits of my advice,
    And he, repu
lsed, a short tale to make,
    Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
    Thence to a watch, then
ce into a weakness,
    Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
    Into the madness where
in now he raves,
    And all we mourn for.
  King. Do you think 'tis this?
  Queen. it may be, ve
ry like.
  Pol. Hath there been such a time- I would fain know that-
    That I have Positively sa
id ''Tis so,'
    When it prov'd otherwise.?
  King. Not that I know.
  Pol. [points to his head 
and shoulder] Take this from this, if
this
      be otherwise.
    If circumstances lead me, I wi
ll find
    Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
    Within the centre.
  King. How may 
we try it further?
  Pol. You know sometimes he walks for hours together
    Here in the lobby.
 
 Queen. So he does indeed.
  Pol. At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him.
    Be you and I b
ehind an arras then.
    Mark the encounter. If he love her not,
    And he not from his reason fa
ll'n thereon
    Let me be no assistant for a state,
    But keep a farm and carters.
  King. We 
will try it.

                 Enter Hamlet, reading on a book.

  Queen. But look where sadly t
he poor wretch comes reading.
  Pol. Away, I do beseech you, both away
    I'll board him presentl
y. O, give me leave.
                       Exeunt King and Queen, [with Attendants].
    How does
 my good Lord Hamlet?
  Ham. Well, God-a-mercy.
  Pol. Do you know me, my lord?
  Ham. Excellent 
well. You are a fishmonger.
  Pol. Not I, my lord.
  Ham. Then I would you were so honest a man.

  Pol. Honest, my lord?
  Ham. Ay, sir. To be honest, as this world goes, is to be one
man
    pi
ck'd out of ten thousand.
  Pol. That's very true, my lord.
  Ham. For if the sun breed maggots in
 a dead dog, being a god
    kissing carrion- Have you a daughter?
  Pol. I have, my lord.
  Ham.
 Let her not walk i' th' sun. Conception is a blessing, but
not
    as your daughter may conceive.
 Friend, look to't.
  Pol. [aside] How say you by that? Still harping on my daughter.
Yet
    he 
knew me not at first. He said I was a fishmonger. He is
far
    gone, far gone! And truly in my yo
uth I suff'red much
extremity
    for love- very near this. I'll speak to him again.- What do
you

    read, my lord?
  Ham. Words, words, words.
  Pol. What is the matter, my lord?
  Ham. Betwe
en who?
  Pol. I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
  Ham. Slanders, sir; for the satirical 
rogue says here that old
men
    have grey beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes
    
purging thick amber and plum-tree gum; and that they have a
    plentiful lack of wit, together wit
h most weak hams. All
which,
    sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I
hold i
t
    not honesty to have it thus set down; for you yourself, sir,
    should be old as I am if, l
ike a crab, you could go backward.

  Pol. [aside] Though this be madness, yet there is a method

in't.-
   Will You walk out of the air, my lord?
  Ham. Into my grave?
  Pol. Indeed, that is out
 o' th' air. [Aside] How pregnant
sometimes
    his replies are! a happiness that often madness hi
ts on,
which
    reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of.
I
    will leave h
im and suddenly contrive the means of meeting
between
    him and my daughter.- My honourable lord
, I will most humbly
take
    my leave of you.
  Ham. You cannot, sir, take from me anything that
 I will more
    willingly part withal- except my life, except my life, except
my
    life,

  
                  Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Pol. Fare you well, my lord.
  Ham. Thes
e tedious old fools!
  Pol. You go to seek the Lord Hamlet. There he is.
  Ros. [to Polonius] God 
save you, sir!
                                                Exit [Polonius].

  Guil. My honou
r'd lord!
  Ros. My most dear lord!
  Ham. My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern?

Ah,
    Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
  Ros. As the indifferent children of the earth.

  Guil. Happy in that we are not over-happy.
    On Fortune's cap we are not the very button.
  
Ham. Nor the soles of her shoe?
  Ros. Neither, my lord.
  Ham. Then you live about her waist, or 
in the middle of her
    favours?
  Guil. Faith, her privates we.
  Ham. In the secret parts of F
ortune? O! most true! she is a
    strumpet. What news ?
  Ros. None, my lord, but that the world'
s grown honest.
  Ham. Then is doomsday near! But your news is not true. Let me
    question more 
in particular. What have you, my good friends,
    deserved at the hands of Fortune that she sends 
you to prison
    hither?
  Guil. Prison, my lord?
  Ham. Denmark's a prison.
  Ros. Then is the
 world one.
  Ham. A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and
    dungeons, Denmar
k being one o' th' worst.
  Ros. We think not so, my lord.
  Ham. Why, then 'tis none to you; for 
there is nothing either
good
    or bad but thinking makes it so. To me it is a prison.
  Ros. Wh
y, then your ambition makes it one. 'Tis too narrow for
your
    mind.
  Ham. O God, I could be b
ounded in a nutshell and count myself a
    king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dre
ams.
  Guil. Which dreams indeed are ambition; for the very substance
of
    the ambitious is mer
ely the shadow of a dream.
  Ham. A dream itself is but a shadow.
  Ros. Truly, and I hold ambitio
n of so airy and light a quality
that
    it is but a shadow's shadow.
  Ham. Then are our beggar
s bodies, and our monarchs and
outstretch'd
    heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we to th' court
? for, by
my
    fay, I cannot reason.
  Both. We'll wait upon you.
  Ham. No such matter! I wil
l not sort you with the rest of my
    servants; for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most

    dreadfully attended. But in the beaten way of friendship,
what
    make you at Elsinore?
  
Ros. To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
  Ham. Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; b
ut I thank
you;
    and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny.
Were
    you not
 sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free
    visitation? Come, deal justly with me. Come, 
come! Nay,
speak.
  Guil. What should we say, my lord?
  Ham. Why, anything- but to th' purpose. 
You were sent for; and
    there is a kind of confession in your looks, which your
modesties
    
have not craft enough to colour. I know the good King and
Queen
    have sent for you.
  Ros. To 
what end, my lord?
  Ham. That you must teach me. But let me conjure you by the
rights
    of our
 fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the
    obligation of our ever-preserved love, and 
by what more dear
a
    better proposer could charge you withal, be even and direct
with
    me,
 whether you were sent for or no.
  Ros. [aside to Guildenstern] What say you?
  Ham. [aside] Nay 
then, I have an eye of you.- If you love me,
hold
    not off.
  Guil. My lord, we were sent for.

  Ham. I will tell you why. So shall my anticipation prevent your
    discovery, and your secrecy
 to the King and Queen moult no
    feather. I have of late- but wherefore I know not- lost all
my

    mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes
so
    heavily with my dispositi
on that this goodly frame, the
earth,
    seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent ca
nopy,
the
    air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this
majestical
    roof fretted 
with golden fire- why, it appeareth no other
thing
    to me than a foul and pestilent congregatio
n of vapours. What
a
    piece of work is a man! how noble in reason! how infinite in
    faculti
es! in form and moving how express and admirable! in
    action how like an angel! in apprehension 
how like a god! the
    beauty of the world, the paragon of animals! And yet to me
what
    is th
is quintessence of dust? Man delights not me- no, nor
woman
    neither, though by your smiling yo
u seem to say so.
  Ros. My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.
  Ham. Why did you laugh
 then, when I said 'Man delights not me'?
  Ros. To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what
 lenten
    entertainment the players shall receive from you. We coted
them
    on the way, and h
ither are they coming to offer you service.
  Ham. He that plays the king shall be welcome- his Maj
esty shall
    have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil
and
    target; the 
lover shall not sigh gratis; the humorous man
shall
    end his part in peace; the clown shall mak
e those laugh whose
    lungs are tickle o' th' sere; and the lady shall say her mind
    freely, 
or the blank verse shall halt for't. What players are
    they?
  Ros. Even those you were wont to
 take such delight in, the
    tragedians of the city.
  Ham. How chances it they travel? Their re
sidence, both in
    reputation and profit, was better both ways.
  Ros. I think their inhibition 
comes by the means of the late
    innovation.
  Ham. Do they hold the same estimation they did wh
en I was in
the
    city? Are they so follow'd?
  Ros. No indeed are they not.
  Ham. How comes 
it? Do they grow rusty?
  Ros. Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there
is,
    s
ir, an eyrie of children, little eyases, that cry out on the
top
    of question and are most tyra
nnically clapp'd for't. These
are now
    the fashion, and so berattle the common stages (so they 
call
    them) that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goosequills and
    dare scarce come thithe
r.
  Ham. What, are they children? Who maintains 'em? How are they
    escoted? Will they pursue t
he quality no longer than they can
    sing? Will they not say afterwards, if they should grow
   
 themselves to common players (as it is most like, if their
means
    are no better), their writer
s do them wrong to make them
exclaim
    against their own succession.
  Ros. Faith, there has be
en much to do on both sides; and the
nation
    holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy. Ther
e was, for
a
    while, no money bid for argument unless the poet and the
player
    went to cuf
fs in the question.
  Ham. Is't possible?
  Guil. O, there has been much throwing about of brains.

  Ham. Do the boys carry it away?
  Ros. Ay, that they do, my lord- Hercules and his load too.
 
 Ham. It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark,
and
    those that would make mows 
at him while my father lived give
    twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his picture

in
    little. 'Sblood, there is something in this more than
natural, if
    philosophy could f
ind it out.

                     Flourish for the Players.

  Guil. There are the players.
  H
am. Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come!
Th'
    appurtenance of welcome is f
ashion and ceremony. Let me
comply
    with you in this garb, lest my extent to the players (which
 I
    tell you must show fairly outwards) should more appear like
    entertainment than yours. Y
ou are welcome. But my
uncle-father
    and aunt-mother are deceiv'd.
  Guil. In what, my dear lo
rd?
  Ham. I am but mad north-north-west. When the wind is southerly
I
    know a hawk from a han
dsaw.

                            Enter Polonius.

  Pol. Well be with you, gentlemen!
  Ham. 
Hark you, Guildenstern- and you too- at each ear a hearer!
    That great baby you see there is not
 yet out of his swaddling
    clouts.
  Ros. Happily he's the second time come to them; for they s
ay an
old
    man is twice a child.
  Ham. I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players. Ma
rk
it.-
   You say right, sir; a Monday morning; twas so indeed.
  Pol. My lord, I have news to t
ell you.
  Ham. My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an
actor in
    Rome-
  Pol. 
The actors are come hither, my lord.
  Ham. Buzz, buzz!
  Pol. Upon my honour-
  Ham. Then came e
ach actor on his ass-
  Pol. The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy,
    history
, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral,
    tragical-historical, tragical-comical-histor
ical-pastoral;
scene
    individable, or poem unlimited. Seneca cannot be too heavy,
nor
    Pla
utus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these
are
    the only men.
  Ham. O Jephtha
h, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
  Pol. What treasure had he, my lord?
  Ham. Why,


         'One fair daughter, and no more,
           The which he loved passing well.'

  Pol.
 [aside] Still on my daughter.
  Ham. Am I not i' th' right, old Jephthah?
  Pol. If you call me J
ephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I
    love passing well.
  Ham. Nay, that follows not.
 
 Pol. What follows then, my lord?
  Ham. Why,

           'As by lot, God wot,'

 and then, you
 know,

           'It came to pass, as most like it was.'

    The first row of the pious chans
on will show you more; for
look
    where my abridgment comes.

                     Enter four 
or five Players.

    You are welcome, masters; welcome, all.- I am glad to see
thee
    well.- 
Welcome, good friends.- O, my old friend? Why, thy
face is
    valanc'd since I saw thee last. Com
'st' thou to' beard me in
    Denmark?- What, my young lady and mistress? By'r Lady, your
    lady
ship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last by the
    altitude of a chopine. Pray God your v
oice, like a piece of
    uncurrent gold, be not crack'd within the ring.- Masters, you
are
    a
ll welcome. We'll e'en to't like French falconers, fly at
    anything we see. We'll have a speech 
straight. Come, give us
a
    taste of your quality. Come, a passionate speech.
  1. Play. What s
peech, my good lord?
  Ham. I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never
acted;
    or i
f it was, not above once; for the play, I remember,
pleas'd
    not the million, 'twas caviary to 
the general; but it was (as
I
    receiv'd it, and others, whose judgments in such matters
cried 
in
    the top of mine) an excellent play, well digested in the
scenes,
    set down with as much
 modesty as cunning. I remember one said
    there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter

savoury,
    nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of
    affectation; but cal
l'd it an honest method, as wholesome as
    sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One s
peech
in't
    I chiefly lov'd. 'Twas AEneas' tale to Dido, and thereabout
of it
    especially 
where he speaks of Priam's slaughter. If it live
in
    your memory, begin at this line- let me se
e, let me see:

         'The rugged Pyrrhus, like th' Hyrcanian beast-'

    'Tis not so; it be
gins with Pyrrhus:

         'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
         Black as his purp
ose, did the night resemble
         When he lay couched in the ominous horse,
         Hath now t
his dread and black complexion smear'd
         With heraldry more dismal. Head to foot
         N
ow is be total gules, horridly trick'd
         With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
 
        Bak'd and impasted with the parching streets,
         That lend a tyrannous and a damned l
ight
         To their lord's murther. Roasted in wrath and fire,
         And thus o'ersized with
 coagulate gore,
         With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
         Old grandsire Pr
iam seeks.'

    So, proceed you.
  Pol. Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and goo
d
     discretion.

  1. Play. 'Anon he finds him,
      Striking too short at Greeks. His antiq
ue sword,
      Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
      Repugnant to command. Unequal ma
tch'd,
      Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide;
      But with the whiff and wind of h
is fell sword
      Th' unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
      Seeming to feel this bl
ow, with flaming top
      Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
      Takes prisoner Pyrrh
us' ear. For lo! his sword,
      Which was declining on the milky head
      Of reverend Priam, s
eem'd i' th' air to stick.
      So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
      And, like a neutral
 to his will and matter,
      Did nothing.
      But, as we often see, against some storm,
     
 A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
      The bold winds speechless, and the orb below

      As hush as death- anon the dreadful thunder
      Doth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus' 
pause,
      Aroused vengeance sets him new awork;
      And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall

      On Mars's armour, forg'd for proof eterne,
      With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding swo
rd
      Now falls on Priam.
      Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods,
      In genera
l synod take away her power;
      Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
      And bowl
 the round nave down the hill of heaven,
      As low as to the fiends!

  Pol. This is too long.

  Ham. It shall to the barber's, with your beard.- Prithee say
on.
    He's for a jig or a tale 
of bawdry, or he sleeps. Say on;
come to
    Hecuba.

  1. Play. 'But who, O who, had seen the m
obled queen-'

  Ham. 'The mobled queen'?
  Pol. That's good! 'Mobled queen' is good.

  1. Pla
y. 'Run barefoot up and down, threat'ning the flames
      With bisson rheum; a clout upon that hea
d
      Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
      About her lank and all o'erteemed loins
,
      A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up-
      Who this had seen, with tongue in venom s
teep'd
      'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have pronounc'd.
      But if the gods themselv
es did see her then,
      When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
      In Mincing with his swo
rd her husband's limbs,
      The instant burst of clamour that she made
      (Unless things mort
al move them not at all)
      Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven
      And passion 
in the gods.'

  Pol. Look, whe'r he has not turn'd his colour, and has tears
in's
    eyes. Pri
thee no more!
  Ham. 'Tis well. I'll have thee speak out the rest of this
soon.-
    Good my lord
, will you see the players well bestow'd? Do you
    hear? Let them be well us'd; for they are the 
abstract and
brief
    chronicles of the time. After your death you were better have
a
    bad e
pitaph than their ill report while you live.
  Pol. My lord, I will use them according to their des
ert.
  Ham. God's bodykins, man, much better! Use every man after his
    desert, and who should s
cape whipping? Use them after your
own
    honour and dignity. The less they deserve, the more mer
it is
in
    your bounty. Take them in.
  Pol. Come, sirs.
  Ham. Follow him, friends. We'll hea
r a play to-morrow.
                 Exeunt Polonius and Players [except the First].
    Dost thou
 hear me, old friend? Can you play 'The Murther of
    Gonzago'?
  1. Play. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. W
e'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need, study a
    speech of some dozen or sixteen lines
 which I would set down
and
    insert in't, could you not?
  1. Play. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Very 
well. Follow that lord- and look you mock him not.
                                            [Exi
t First Player.]
    My good friends, I'll leave you till night. You are welcome
to
    Elsinore.

  Ros. Good my lord!
  Ham. Ay, so, God b' wi' ye!
                            [Exeunt Rosencran
tz and Guildenstern
    Now I am alone.
    O what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
    Is it not 
monstrous that this player here,
    But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
    Could force his 
soul so to his own conceit
    That, from her working, all his visage wann'd,
    Tears in his eye
s, distraction in's aspect,
    A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
    With forms to h
is conceit? And all for nothing!
    For Hecuba!
    What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
    T
hat he should weep for her? What would he do,
    Had he the motive and the cue for passion
    Th
at I have? He would drown the stage with tears
    And cleave the general ear with horrid speech;

    Make mad the guilty and appal the free,
    Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed
    The ve
ry faculties of eyes and ears.
    Yet I,
    A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak
    Like John
-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
    And can say nothing! No, not for a king,
    Upon whose pro
perty and most dear life
    A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
    Who calls me villain? br
eaks my pate across?
    Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?
    Tweaks me by th' nose? g
ives me the lie i' th' throat
    As deep as to the lungs? Who does me this, ha?
    'Swounds, I s
hould take it! for it cannot be
    But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall
    To make oppression b
itter, or ere this
    I should have fatted all the region kites
    With this slave's offal. Bloo
dy bawdy villain!
    Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
    O, vengeance!
  
  Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
    That I, the son of a dear father murther'd,
    P
rompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
    Must (like a whore) unpack my heart with words
    A
nd fall a-cursing like a very drab,
    A scullion!
    Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! Hum, I h
ave heard
    That guilty creatures, sitting at a play,
    Have by the very cunning of the scene

    Been struck so to the soul that presently
    They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
    Fo
r murther, though it have no tongue, will speak
    With most miraculous organ, I'll have these Pla
yers
    Play something like the murther of my father
    Before mine uncle. I'll observe his look
s;
    I'll tent him to the quick. If he but blench,
    I know my course. The spirit that I have 
seen
    May be a devil; and the devil hath power
    T' assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps

    Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
    As he is very potent with such spirits,
    Abuses
 me to damn me. I'll have grounds
    More relative than this. The play's the thing
    Wherein I'
ll catch the conscience of the King.         Exit.

ACT III. Scene I.
Elsinore.
 A room in the Castle.

Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern,
and Lord
s.

  King. And can you by no drift of circumstance
    Get from him why he puts on this confusio
n,
    Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
    With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
  Ros. H
e does confess he feels himself distracted,
    But from what cause he will by no means speak.
  G
uil. Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
    But with a crafty madness keeps aloof
    When 
we would bring him on to some confession
    Of his true state.
  Queen. Did he receive you well?

  Ros. Most like a gentleman.
  Guil. But with much forcing of his disposition.
  Ros. Niggard of
 question, but of our demands
    Most free in his reply.
  Queen. Did you assay him
    To any p
astime?
  Ros. Madam, it so fell out that certain players
    We o'erraught on the way. Of these w
e told him,
    And there did seem in him a kind of joy
    To hear of it. They are here about the
 court,
    And, as I think, they have already order
    This night to play before him.
  Pol. 'T
is most true;
    And he beseech'd me to entreat your Majesties
    To hear and see the matter.
 
 King. With all my heart, and it doth much content me
    To hear him so inclin'd.
    Good gentle
men, give him a further edge
    And drive his purpose on to these delights.
  Ros. We shall, my l
ord.
                            Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
  King. Sweet Gertrude, leav
e us too;
    For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
    That he, as 'twere by accident, may 
here
    Affront Ophelia.
    Her father and myself (lawful espials)
    Will so bestow ourselves
 that, seeing unseen,
    We may of their encounter frankly judge
    And gather by him, as he is 
behav'd,
    If't be th' affliction of his love, or no,
    That thus he suffers for.
  Queen. I 
shall obey you;
    And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
    That your good beauties be the happy
 cause
    Of Hamlet's wildness. So shall I hope your virtues
    Will bring him to his wonted way
 again,
    To both your honours.
  Oph. Madam, I wish it may.
                                  
                 [Exit Queen.]
  Pol. Ophelia, walk you here.- Gracious, so please you,
    We wil
l bestow ourselves.- [To Ophelia] Read on this book,
    That show of such an exercise may colour

    Your loneliness.- We are oft to blame in this,
    'Tis too much prov'd, that with devotion's v
isage
    And pious action we do sugar o'er
    The Devil himself.
  King. [aside] O, 'tis too tr
ue!
    How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
    The harlot's cheek, beautied wit
h plast'ring art,
    Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
    Than is my deed to my most p
ainted word.
    O heavy burthen!
  Pol. I hear him coming. Let's withdraw, my lord.
            
                          Exeunt King and Polonius].

                           Enter Hamlet.


  Ham. To be, or not to be- that is the question:
    Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
  
  The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
    Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
    A
nd by opposing end them. To die- to sleep-
    No more; and by a sleep to say we end
    The heart
ache, and the thousand natural shocks
    That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation
    Devoutly 
to be wish'd. To die- to sleep.
    To sleep- perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub!
    For in 
that sleep of death what dreams may come
    When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
    Must 
give us pause. There's the respect
    That makes calamity of so long life.
    For who would bear
 the whips and scorns of time,
    Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
    The pangs
 of despis'd love, the law's delay,
    The insolence of office, and the spurns
    That patient m
erit of th' unworthy takes,
    When he himself might his quietus make
    With a bare bodkin? Who
 would these fardels bear,
    To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
    But that the dread of so
mething after death-
    The undiscover'd country, from whose bourn
    No traveller returns- puzz
les the will,
    And makes us rather bear those ills we have
    Than fly to others that we know 
not of?
    Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
    And thus the native hue of resolution

    Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
    And enterprises of great pith and moment

    With this regard their currents turn awry
    And lose the name of action.- Soft you now!
   
 The fair Ophelia!- Nymph, in thy orisons
    Be all my sins rememb'red.
  Oph. Good my lord,
   
 How does your honour for this many a day?
  Ham. I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
  Oph. My 
lord, I have remembrances of yours
    That I have longed long to re-deliver.
    I pray you, now 
receive them.
  Ham. No, not I!
    I never gave you aught.
  Oph. My honour'd lord, you know rig
ht well you did,
    And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd
    As made the things more r
ich. Their perfume lost,
    Take these again; for to the noble mind
    Rich gifts wax poor when 
givers prove unkind.
    There, my lord.
  Ham. Ha, ha! Are you honest?
  Oph. My lord?
  Ham. A
re you fair?
  Oph. What means your lordship?
  Ham. That if you be honest and fair, your honesty 
should admit
no
    discourse to your beauty.
  Oph. Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce 
than with
honesty?
  Ham. Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform
    honesty fr
om what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty
can
    translate beauty into his likeness. This
 was sometime a
paradox,
    but now the time gives it proof. I did love you once.
  Oph. Indeed,
 my lord, you made me believe so.
  Ham. You should not have believ'd me; for virtue cannot so
   
 inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it. I loved
you
    not.
  Oph. I was the more de
ceived.
  Ham. Get thee to a nunnery! Why wouldst thou be a breeder of
    sinners? I am myself in
different honest, but yet I could
accuse
    me of such things that it were better my mother had n
ot borne
me.
    I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more offences at
my
    beck than 
I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give
    them shape, or time to act them in. What sh
ould such fellows
as I
    do, crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves
all;
    
believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where's your
    father?
  Oph. At home, my lord.
 
 Ham. Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool
    nowhere but in's own house. Far
ewell.
  Oph. O, help him, you sweet heavens!
  Ham. If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plagu
e for thy
dowry:
    be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not
escape
    calumn
y. Get thee to a nunnery. Go, farewell. Or if thou wilt
    needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men
 know well enough what
    monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go; and quickly too.
    Farew
ell.
  Oph. O heavenly powers, restore him!
  Ham. I have heard of your paintings too, well enough
. God hath
    given you one face, and you make yourselves another. You jig,
you
    amble, and y
ou lisp; you nickname God's creatures and make
your
    wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I'll no 
more on't! it hath
made
    me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages. Those that are
    mar
ried already- all but one- shall live; the rest shall keep
as
    they are. To a nunnery, go.     
                       Exit.
  Oph. O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
    The courtier's, s
cholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword,
    Th' expectancy and rose of the fair state,
    The gl
ass of fashion and the mould of form,
    Th' observ'd of all observers- quite, quite down!
    An
d I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
    That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
    Now see 
that noble and most sovereign reason,
    Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
    Tha
t unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
    Blasted with ecstasy. O, woe is me
    T' have see
n what I have seen, see what I see!

                   Enter King and Polonius.

  King. Love? 
his affections do not that way tend;
    Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,
    Wa
s not like madness. There's something in his soul
    O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
   
 And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
    Will be some danger; which for to prevent,
    I ha
ve in quick determination
    Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England
    For the demand 
of our neglected tribute.
    Haply the seas, and countries different,
    With variable objects, 
shall expel
    This something-settled matter in his heart,
    Whereon his brains still beating p
uts him thus
    From fashion of himself. What think you on't?
  Pol. It shall do well. But yet do
 I believe
    The origin and commencement of his grief
    Sprung from neglected love.- How now, 
Ophelia?
    You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said.
    We heard it all.- My lord, do as you 
please;
    But if you hold it fit, after the play
    Let his queen mother all alone entreat him

    To show his grief. Let her be round with him;
    And I'll be plac'd so please you, in the ear

    Of all their conference. If she find him not,
    To England send him; or confine him where

    Your wisdom best shall think.
  King. It shall be so.
    Madness in great ones must not unwat
ch'd go.         Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. hall in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet and three
 of the Players.

  Ham. Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounc'd it to you,
    trippingly 
on the tongue. But if you mouth it, as many of our
    players do, I had as live the town crier spo
ke my lines. Nor
do
    not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all
    gently; fo
r in the very torrent, tempest, and (as I may say)
    whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire 
and beget a
    temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to
the
    soul to hear 
a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion
to
    tatters, to very rags, to split the cars o
f the groundlings,
who
    (for the most part) are capable of nothing but inexplicable
dumb
    
shows and noise. I would have such a fellow whipp'd for
o'erdoing
    Termagant. It out-herods Her
od. Pray you avoid it.
  Player. I warrant your honour.
  Ham. Be not too tame neither; but let yo
ur own discretion be
your
    tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the action;
with
 
   this special observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of
    nature: for anything so overdo
ne is from the purpose of
playing,
    whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, 
as
    'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show Virtue her own
feature,
    scorn her own image, 
and the very age and body of the time
his
    form and pressure. Now this overdone, or come tardy 
off,
though
    it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious
    grieve; the censur
e of the which one must in your allowance
    o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be play
ers that
I
    have seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly (not
to
    speak it pro
fanely), that, neither having the accent of
    Christians, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor m
an, have
so
    strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of Nature's
    journeymen had mad
e men, and not made them well, they
imitated
    humanity so abominably.
  Player. I hope we have
 reform'd that indifferently with us,
sir.
  Ham. O, reform it altogether! And let those that play
 your
clowns
    speak no more than is set down for them. For there be of them
    that will them
selves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren
    spectators to laugh too, though in the mean tim
e some
necessary
    question of the play be then to be considered. That's
villanous
    and sho
ws a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it.
Go
    make you ready.
                     
                            Exeunt Players.

            Enter Polonius, Rosencrantz, and Guildens
tern.

    How now, my lord? Will the King hear this piece of work?
  Pol. And the Queen too, and
 that presently.
  Ham. Bid the players make haste, [Exit Polonius.] Will you two
    help to hast
en them?
  Both. We will, my lord.                       Exeunt they two.
  Ham. What, ho, Horatio
!

                      Enter Horatio.

  Hor. Here, sweet lord, at your service.
  Ham. Horat
io, thou art e'en as just a man
    As e'er my conversation cop'd withal.
  Hor. O, my dear lord!

  Ham. Nay, do not think I flatter;
    For what advancement may I hope from thee,
    That no re
venue hast but thy good spirits
    To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
   
 No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
    And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
    Wh
ere thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
    Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
 
   And could of men distinguish, her election
    Hath seal'd thee for herself. For thou hast been

    As one, in suff'ring all, that suffers nothing;
    A man that Fortune's buffets and rewards

    Hast ta'en with equal thanks; and blest are those
    Whose blood and judgment are so well comm
ingled
    That they are not a pipe for Fortune's finger
    To sound what stop she please. Give m
e that man
    That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
    In my heart's core, ay, in my 
heart of heart,
    As I do thee. Something too much of this I
    There is a play to-night before
 the King.
    One scene of it comes near the circumstance,
    Which I have told thee, of my fath
er's death.
    I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
    Even with the very comment of thy s
oul
    Observe my uncle. If his occulted guilt
    Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
    It 
is a damned ghost that we have seen,
    And my imaginations are as foul
    As Vulcan's stithy. G
ive him heedful note;
    For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,
    And after we will both our j
udgments join
    In censure of his seeming.
  Hor. Well, my lord.
    If he steal aught the whil
st this play is playing,
    And scape detecting, I will pay the theft.

    Sound a flourish. [E
nter Trumpets and Kettledrums. Danish
    march. [Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz
,
      Guildenstern, and other Lords attendant, with the Guard
                       carrying to
rches.

  Ham. They are coming to the play. I must be idle.
    Get you a place.
  King. How far
es our cousin Hamlet?
  Ham. Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish. I eat the
air,
    pro
mise-cramm'd. You cannot feed capons so.
  King. I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet. These wor
ds are
not
    mine.
  Ham. No, nor mine now. [To Polonius] My lord, you play'd once
    i' th' 
university, you say?
  Pol. That did I, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.
  Ham. What did y
ou enact?
  Pol. I did enact Julius Caesar; I was kill'd i' th' Capitol;
Brutus
    kill'd me.
 
 Ham. It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf
there. Be
    the players ready.
  Ros
. Ay, my lord. They stay upon your patience.
  Queen. Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
  Ha
m. No, good mother. Here's metal more attractive.
  Pol. [to the King] O, ho! do you mark that?
  
Ham. Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
                                  [Sits down at Ophelia's feet.
]

  Oph. No, my lord.
  Ham. I mean, my head upon your lap?
  Oph. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Do you 
think I meant country matters?
  Oph. I think nothing, my lord.
  Ham. That's a fair thought to li
e between maids' legs.
  Oph. What is, my lord?
  Ham. Nothing.
  Oph. You are merry, my lord.
 
 Ham. Who, I?
  Oph. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. O God, your only jig-maker! What should a man do but be

merry?
    For look you how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father
died
    within 's two hour
s.
  Oph. Nay 'tis twice two months, my lord.
  Ham. So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, 
for I'll have
a
    suit of sables. O heavens! die two months ago, and not
forgotten
    yet? Th
en there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his
life
    half a year. But, by'r Lady, he must
 build churches then; or
else
    shall he suffer not thinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose


    epitaph is 'For O, for O, the hobby-horse is forgot!'

               Hautboys play. The dumb 
show enters.

    Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing
    him and he her.
 She kneels, and makes show of protestation
    unto him. He takes her up, and declines his head up
on her
    neck. He lays him down upon a bank of flowers. She, seeing
    him asleep, leaves him. 
Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his
    crown, kisses it, pours poison in the sleeper's ears, and

    leaves him. The Queen returns, finds the King dead, and makes
    passionate action. The Pois
oner with some three or four
Mutes,
    comes in again, seem to condole with her. The dead body is

    carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with gifts; she
    seems harsh and unwilling awhi
le, but in the end accepts
    his love.
                                                         
Exeunt.

  Oph. What means this, my lord?
  Ham. Marry, this is miching malhecho; it means mischi
ef.
  Oph. Belike this show imports the argument of the play.

                      Enter Prolog
ue.

  Ham. We shall know by this fellow. The players cannot keep
counsel;
    they'll tell all.

  Oph. Will he tell us what this show meant?
  Ham. Ay, or any show that you'll show him. Be not 
you asham'd
to
    show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means.
  Oph. You are naught, you ar
e naught! I'll mark the play.

    Pro. For us, and for our tragedy,
      Here stooping to your 
clemency,
      We beg your hearing patiently.                     [Exit.]

  Ham. Is this a prol
ogue, or the posy of a ring?
  Oph. 'Tis brief, my lord.
  Ham. As woman's love.

              
Enter [two Players as] King and Queen.

    King. Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round

      Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
      And thirty dozen moons with borrowed she
en
      About the world have times twelve thirties been,
      Since love our hearts, and Hymen d
id our hands,
      Unite comutual in most sacred bands.
    Queen. So many journeys may the sun a
nd moon
      Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
      But woe is me! you are so sick of l
ate,
      So far from cheer and from your former state.
      That I distrust you. Yet, though I 
distrust,
      Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must;
      For women's fear and love holds qu
antity,
      In neither aught, or in extremity.
      Now what my love is, proof hath made you kn
ow;
      And as my love is siz'd, my fear is so.
      Where love is great, the littlest doubts a
re fear;
      Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.
    King. Faith, I must leav
e thee, love, and shortly too;
      My operant powers their functions leave to do.
      And thou
 shalt live in this fair world behind,
      Honour'd, belov'd, and haply one as kind
      For hu
sband shalt thou-
    Queen. O, confound the rest!
      Such love must needs be treason in my bre
ast.
      When second husband let me be accurst!
      None wed the second but who killed the fir
st.

  Ham. [aside] Wormwood, wormwood!

    Queen. The instances that second marriage move
   
   Are base respects of thrift, but none of love.
      A second time I kill my husband dead
     
 When second husband kisses me in bed.
    King. I do believe you think what now you speak;
      
But what we do determine oft we break.
      Purpose is but the slave to memory,
      Of violent 
birth, but poor validity;
      Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree,
      But fall u
nshaken when they mellow be.
      Most necessary 'tis that we forget
      To pay ourselves what 
to ourselves is debt.
      What to ourselves in passion we propose,
      The passion ending, dot
h the purpose lose.
      The violence of either grief or joy
      Their own enactures with thems
elves destroy.
      Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
      Grief joys, joy grieves,
 on slender accident.
      This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
      That even our lo
ves should with our fortunes change;
      For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
      Whether
 love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
      The great man down, you mark his favourite flies,

      The poor advanc'd makes friends of enemies;
      And hitherto doth love on fortune tend,
  
    For who not needs shall never lack a friend,
      And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
 
     Directly seasons him his enemy.
      But, orderly to end where I begun,
      Our wills and 
fates do so contrary run
      That our devices still are overthrown;
      Our thoughts are ours,
 their ends none of our own.
      So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
      But die thy tho
ughts when thy first lord is dead.
    Queen. Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light,
      S
port and repose lock from me day and night,
      To desperation turn my trust and hope,
      An 
anchor's cheer in prison be my scope,
      Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
      Meet w
hat I would have well, and it destroy,
      Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
      I
f, once a widow, ever I be wife!

  Ham. If she should break it now!

    King. 'Tis deeply swor
n. Sweet, leave me here awhile.
      My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile
      The ted
ious day with sleep.
    Queen. Sleep rock thy brain,
                                            
        [He] sleeps.
      And never come mischance between us twain!
Exit.

  Ham. Madam, how l
ike you this play?
  Queen. The lady doth protest too much, methinks.
  Ham. O, but she'll keep he
r word.
  King. Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in't?
  Ham. No, no! They do but 
jest, poison in jest; no offence i'
th'
    world.
  King. What do you call the play?
  Ham. 'Th
e Mousetrap.' Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the
    image of a murther done in Vienna. Gonza
go is the duke's
name;
    his wife, Baptista. You shall see anon. 'Tis a knavish piece
of
    w
ork; but what o' that? Your Majesty, and we that have free
    souls, it touches us not. Let the ga
ll'd jade winch; our
withers
    are unwrung.

                         Enter Lucianus.

    T
his is one Lucianus, nephew to the King.
  Oph. You are as good as a chorus, my lord.
  Ham. I cou
ld interpret between you and your love, if I could
see
    the puppets dallying.
  Oph. You are k
een, my lord, you are keen.
  Ham. It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
  Oph. Still 
better, and worse.
  Ham. So you must take your husbands.- Begin, murtherer. Pox,
leave
    thy d
amnable faces, and begin! Come, the croaking raven doth
    bellow for revenge.

    Luc. Thought
s black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
      Confederate season, else no creature seeing
;
      Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,
      With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, th
rice infected,
      Thy natural magic and dire property
      On wholesome life usurp immediately
.
                                   Pours the poison in his ears.

  Ham. He poisons him i' th' 
garden for's estate. His name's
Gonzago.
    The story is extant, and written in very choice Itali
an. You
    shall see anon how the murtherer gets the love of Gonzago's
wife.
  Oph. The King ris
es.
  Ham. What, frighted with false fire?
  Queen. How fares my lord?
  Pol. Give o'er the play.

  King. Give me some light! Away!
  All. Lights, lights, lights!
                              E
xeunt all but Hamlet and Horatio.
  Ham.   Why, let the strucken deer go weep,
          The hart 
ungalled play;
         For some must watch, while some must sleep:
          Thus runs the world 
away.
    Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers- if the rest of
my
    fortunes turn Turk
 with me-with two Provincial roses on my
raz'd
    shoes, get me a fellowship in a cry of players,
 sir?
  Hor. Half a share.
  Ham.   A whole one I!
         For thou dost know, O Damon dear,
  
         This realm dismantled was
         Of Jove himself; and now reigns here
           A very
, very- pajock.
  Hor. You might have rhym'd.
  Ham. O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word fo
r a thousand
    pound! Didst perceive?
  Hor. Very well, my lord.
  Ham. Upon the talk of the po
isoning?
  Hor. I did very well note him.
  Ham.   Aha! Come, some music! Come, the recorders!
  
       For if the King like not the comedy,
         Why then, belike he likes it not, perdy.
    
Come, some music!

                Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Guil. Good my lord, vo
uchsafe me a word with you.
  Ham. Sir, a whole history.
  Guil. The King, sir-
  Ham. Ay, sir, w
hat of him?
  Guil. Is in his retirement, marvellous distemper'd.
  Ham. With drink, sir?
  Guil.
 No, my lord; rather with choler.
  Ham. Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this

to
    the doctor; for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps
    plunge him into far more
 choler.
  Guil. Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame, and
start
    not so wildly fr
om my affair.
  Ham. I am tame, sir; pronounce.
  Guil. The Queen, your mother, in most great affl
iction of
spirit
    hath sent me to you.
  Ham. You are welcome.
  Guil. Nay, good my lord, thi
s courtesy is not of the right
breed.
    If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, I 
will
do
    your mother's commandment; if not, your pardon and my return
    shall be the end of 
my business.
  Ham. Sir, I cannot.
  Guil. What, my lord?
  Ham. Make you a wholesome answer; my 
wit's diseas'd. But, sir,
such
    answer as I can make, you shall command; or rather, as you
say
,
    my mother. Therefore no more, but to the matter! My mother,
you
    say-
  Ros. Then thus 
she says: your behaviour hath struck her into
    amazement and admiration.
  Ham. O wonderful son
, that can so stonish a mother! But is
there no
    sequel at the heels of this mother's admiratio
n? Impart.
  Ros. She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to
bed.
  Ham. We shall 
obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any
    further trade with us?
  Ros. My lord, you o
nce did love me.
  Ham. And do still, by these pickers and stealers!
  Ros. Good my lord, what is 
your cause of distemper? You do
surely
    bar the door upon your own liberty, if you deny your gr
iefs
to
    your friend.
  Ham. Sir, I lack advancement.
  Ros. How can that be, when you have t
he voice of the King
himself
    for your succession in Denmark?
  Ham. Ay, sir, but 'while the g
rass grows'- the proverb is
something
    musty.

                     Enter the Players with re
corders.

    O, the recorders! Let me see one. To withdraw with you- why
do
    you go about to
 recover the wind of me, as if you would drive
me
    into a toil?
  Guil. O my lord, if my duty 
be too bold, my love is too
unmannerly.
  Ham. I do not well understand that. Will you play upon t
his
pipe?
  Guil. My lord, I cannot.
  Ham. I pray you.
  Guil. Believe me, I cannot.
  Ham. I 
do beseech you.
  Guil. I know, no touch of it, my lord.
  Ham. It is as easy as lying. Govern the
se ventages with your
    fingers and thumbs, give it breath with your mouth, and it
will
    dis
course most eloquent music. Look you, these are the stops.
  Guil. But these cannot I command to an
y utt'rance of harmony. I
    have not the skill.
  Ham. Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing y
ou make of me!
You
    would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you
would
    pluck 
out the heart of my mystery; you would sound me from my
    lowest note to the top of my compass; a
nd there is much
music,
    excellent voice, in this little organ, yet cannot you make it
    spe
ak. 'Sblood, do you think I am easier to be play'd on than
a
    pipe? Call me what instrument you
 will, though you can fret
me,
    you cannot play upon me.

                        Enter Polon
ius.

    God bless you, sir!
  Pol. My lord, the Queen would speak with you, and presently.
  H
am. Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
  Pol. By th' mass, and 'tis like a 
camel indeed.
  Ham. Methinks it is like a weasel.
  Pol. It is back'd like a weasel.
  Ham. Or l
ike a whale.
  Pol. Very like a whale.
  Ham. Then will I come to my mother by-and-by.- They fool 
me to
the
    top of my bent.- I will come by-and-by.
  Pol. I will say so.                      
                Exit.
  Ham. 'By-and-by' is easily said.- Leave me, friends.
                     
                   [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]

    'Tis now the very witching time of night,
    Wh
en churchyards yawn, and hell itself breathes out
    Contagion to this world. Now could I drink ho
t blood
    And do such bitter business as the day
    Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mot
her!
    O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever
    The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom.
 
   Let me be cruel, not unnatural;
    I will speak daggers to her, but use none.
    My tongue an
d soul in this be hypocrites-
    How in my words somever she be shent,
    To give them seals nev
er, my soul, consent!             Exit.




Scene III.
A room in the Castle.

Enter King, Ro
sencrantz, and Guildenstern.

  King. I like him not, nor stands it safe with us
    To let his m
adness range. Therefore prepare you;
    I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
    And he to 
England shall along with you.
    The terms of our estate may not endure
    Hazard so near us as 
doth hourly grow
    Out of his lunacies.
  Guil. We will ourselves provide.
    Most holy and re
ligious fear it is
    To keep those many many bodies safe
    That live and feed upon your Majest
y.
  Ros. The single and peculiar life is bound
    With all the strength and armour of the mind

    To keep itself from noyance; but much more
    That spirit upon whose weal depends and rests
 
   The lives of many. The cesse of majesty
    Dies not alone, but like a gulf doth draw
    What'
s near it with it. It is a massy wheel,
    Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,
    To whose
 huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
    Are mortis'd and adjoin'd; which when it falls,
    Ea
ch small annexment, petty consequence,
    Attends the boist'rous ruin. Never alone
    Did the ki
ng sigh, but with a general groan.
  King. Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;
    For we 
will fetters put upon this fear,
    Which now goes too free-footed.
  Both. We will haste us.
  
                                             Exeunt Gentlemen.

                   Enter Polonius.


  Pol. My lord, he's going to his mother's closet.
    Behind the arras I'll convey myself
   
 To hear the process. I'll warrant she'll tax him home;
    And, as you said, and wisely was it sai
d,
    'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,
    Since nature makes them partial, shoul
d o'erhear
    The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege.
    I'll call upon you ere you go 
to bed
    And tell you what I know.
  King. Thanks, dear my lord.
                              
                  Exit [Polonius].
    O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven;
    It hath the
 primal eldest curse upon't,
    A brother's murther! Pray can I not,
    Though inclination be as
 sharp as will.
    My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent,
    And, like a man to double busi
ness bound,
    I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
    And both neglect. What if this cur
sed hand
    Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,
    Is there not rain enough in the sw
eet heavens
    To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
    But to confront the visage of o
ffence?
    And what's in prayer but this twofold force,
    To be forestalled ere we come to fall
,
    Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;
    My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer

    Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murther'?
    That cannot be; since I am still possess
'd
    Of those effects for which I did the murther-
    My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen
.
    May one be pardon'd and retain th' offence?
    In the corrupted currents of this world
   
 Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,
    And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
    Buy
s out the law; but 'tis not so above.
    There is no shuffling; there the action lies
    In his 
true nature, and we ourselves compell'd,
    Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
    To 
give in evidence. What then? What rests?
    Try what repentance can. What can it not?
    Yet wha
t can it when one cannot repent?
    O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
    O limed soul, t
hat, struggling to be free,
    Art more engag'd! Help, angels! Make assay.
    Bow, stubborn knee
s; and heart with strings of steel,
    Be soft as sinews of the new-born babe!
    All may be wel
l.                                  He kneels.

                         Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. N
ow might I do it pat, now he is praying;
    And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven,
    And 
so am I reveng'd. That would be scann'd.
    A villain kills my father; and for that,
    I, his s
ole son, do this same villain send
    To heaven.
    Why, this is hire and salary, not revenge!

    He took my father grossly, full of bread,
    With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;

    And how his audit stands, who knows save heaven?
    But in our circumstance and course of th
ought,
    'Tis heavy with him; and am I then reveng'd,
    To take him in the purging of his soul
,
    When he is fit and seasoned for his passage?
    No.
    Up, sword, and know thou a more ho
rrid hent.
    When he is drunk asleep; or in his rage;
    Or in th' incestuous pleasure of his b
ed;
    At gaming, swearing, or about some act
    That has no relish of salvation in't-
    Then
 trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,
    And that his soul may be as damn'd and black
   
 As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays.
    This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.          
    Exit.
  King. [rises] My words fly up, my thoughts remain below.
    Words without thoughts ne
ver to heaven go.             Exit.




Scene IV.
The Queen's closet.

Enter Queen and Polon
ius.

  Pol. He will come straight. Look you lay home to him.
    Tell him his pranks have been t
oo broad to bear with,
    And that your Grace hath screen'd and stood between
    Much heat and h
im. I'll silence me even here.
    Pray you be round with him.
  Ham. (within) Mother, mother, mot
her!
  Queen. I'll warrant you; fear me not. Withdraw; I hear him
coming.
                       
       [Polonius hides behind the arras.]

                          Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Now, 
mother, what's the matter?
  Queen. Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
  Ham. Mother, you
 have my father much offended.
  Queen. Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
  Ham. Go, go,
 you question with a wicked tongue.
  Queen. Why, how now, Hamlet?
  Ham. What's the matter now?

  Queen. Have you forgot me?
  Ham. No, by the rood, not so!
    You are the Queen, your husband's
 brother's wife,
    And (would it were not so!) you are my mother.
  Queen. Nay, then I'll set th
ose to you that can speak.
  Ham. Come, come, and sit you down. You shall not budge;
    You go no
t till I set you up a glass
    Where you may see the inmost part of you.
  Queen. What wilt thou 
do? Thou wilt not murther me?
    Help, help, ho!
  Pol. [behind] What, ho! help, help, help!
  H
am. [draws] How now? a rat? Dead for a ducat, dead!
            [Makes a pass through the arras and
] kills Polonius.
  Pol. [behind] O, I am slain!
  Queen. O me, what hast thou done?
  Ham. Nay, 
I know not. Is it the King?
  Queen. O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
  Ham. A bloody deed-
 almost as bad, good mother,
    As kill a king, and marry with his brother.
  Queen. As kill a ki
ng?
  Ham. Ay, lady, it was my word.
                         [Lifts up the arras and sees Poloniu
s.]
    Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
    I took thee for thy better. Take thy fo
rtune.
    Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.
    Leave wringing of your hands. Peace! si
t you down
    And let me wring your heart; for so I shall
    If it be made of penetrable stuff;

    If damned custom have not braz'd it so
    That it is proof and bulwark against sense.
  Quee
n. What have I done that thou dar'st wag thy tongue
    In noise so rude against me?
  Ham. Such a
n act
    That blurs the grace and blush of modesty;
    Calls virtue hypocrite; takes off the ros
e
    From the fair forehead of an innocent love,
    And sets a blister there; makes marriage vow
s
    As false as dicers' oaths. O, such a deed
    As from the body of contraction plucks
    Th
e very soul, and sweet religion makes
    A rhapsody of words! Heaven's face doth glow;
    Yea, t
his solidity and compound mass,
    With tristful visage, as against the doom,
    Is thought-sick
 at the act.
  Queen. Ah me, what act,
    That roars so loud and thunders in the index?
  Ham. L
ook here upon th's picture, and on this,
    The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
    See 
what a grace was seated on this brow;
    Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
    An eye 
like Mars, to threaten and command;
    A station like the herald Mercury
    New lighted on a hea
ven-kissing hill:
    A combination and a form indeed
    Where every god did seem to set his seal

    To give the world assurance of a man.
    This was your husband. Look you now what follows.

    Here is your husband, like a mildew'd ear
    Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
 
   Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
    And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes
 
   You cannot call it love; for at your age
    The heyday in the blood is tame, it's humble,
    
And waits upon the judgment; and what judgment
    Would step from this to this? Sense sure you hav
e,
    Else could you not have motion; but sure that sense
    Is apoplex'd; for madness would not
 err,
    Nor sense to ecstacy was ne'er so thrall'd
    But it reserv'd some quantity of choice

    To serve in such a difference. What devil was't
    That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind
?
    Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
    Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans a
ll,
    Or but a sickly part of one true sense
    Could not so mope.
    O shame! where is thy b
lush? Rebellious hell,
    If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
    To flaming youth let virt
ue be as wax
    And melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame
    When the compulsive ardour gives 
the charge,
    Since frost itself as actively doth burn,
    And reason panders will.
  Queen. O
 Hamlet, speak no more!
    Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul,
    And there I see such bla
ck and grained spots
    As will not leave their tinct.
  Ham. Nay, but to live
    In the rank s
weat of an enseamed bed,
    Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love
    Over the nasty sty
!
  Queen. O, speak to me no more!
    These words like daggers enter in mine ears.
    No more, 
sweet Hamlet!
  Ham. A murtherer and a villain!
    A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe

    Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
    A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
    That f
rom a shelf the precious diadem stole
    And put it in his pocket!
  Queen. No more!

         
       Enter the Ghost in his nightgown.

  Ham. A king of shreds and patches!-
    Save me and h
over o'er me with your wings,
    You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?
  Queen. A
las, he's mad!
  Ham. Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
    That, laps'd in time and passio
n, lets go by
    Th' important acting of your dread command?
    O, say!
  Ghost. Do not forget.
 This visitation
    Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
    But look, amazement on thy mot
her sits.
    O, step between her and her fighting soul
    Conceit in weakest bodies strongest wo
rks.
    Speak to her, Hamlet.
  Ham. How is it with you, lady?
  Queen. Alas, how is't with you,

    That you do bend your eye on vacancy,
    And with th' encorporal air do hold discourse?
   
 Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
    And, as the sleeping soldiers in th' alarm,
    
Your bedded hairs, like life in excrements,
    Start up and stand an end. O gentle son,
    Upon 
the heat and flame of thy distemper
    Sprinkle cool patience! Whereon do you look?
  Ham. On him
, on him! Look you how pale he glares!
    His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
    
Would make them capable.- Do not look upon me,
    Lest with this piteous action you convert
    M
y stern effects. Then what I have to do
    Will want true colour- tears perchance for blood.
  Qu
een. To whom do you speak this?
  Ham. Do you see nothing there?
  Queen. Nothing at all; yet all 
that is I see.
  Ham. Nor did you nothing hear?
  Queen. No, nothing but ourselves.
  Ham. Why, l
ook you there! Look how it steals away!
    My father, in his habit as he liv'd!
    Look where he
 goes even now out at the portal!
                                                     Exit Ghost.

  Queen. This is the very coinage of your brain.
    This bodiless creation ecstasy
    Is very c
unning in.
  Ham. Ecstasy?
    My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time
    And makes as heal
thful music. It is not madness
    That I have utt'red. Bring me to the test,
    And I the matter
 will reword; which madness
    Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
    Lay not that fla
ttering unction to your soul
    That not your trespass but my madness speaks.
    It will but ski
n and film the ulcerous place,
    Whiles rank corruption, mining all within,
    Infects unseen. 
Confess yourself to heaven;
    Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
    And do not spread t
he compost on the weeds
    To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;
    For in the fatness
 of these pursy times
    Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg-
    Yea, curb and woo for leave t
o do him good.
  Queen. O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
  Ham. O, throw away the wors
er part of it,
    And live the purer with the other half,
    Good night- but go not to my uncle'
s bed.
    Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
    That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat

    Of habits evil, is angel yet in this,
    That to the use of actions fair and good
    He like
wise gives a frock or livery,
    That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,
    And that shall lend 
a kind of easiness
    To the next abstinence; the next more easy;
    For use almost can change t
he stamp of nature,
    And either [master] the devil, or throw him out
    With wondrous potency.
 Once more, good night;
    And when you are desirous to be blest,
    I'll blessing beg of you.- 
For this same lord,
    I do repent; but heaven hath pleas'd it so,
    To punish me with this, an
d this with me,
    That I must be their scourge and minister.
    I will bestow him, and will ans
wer well
    The death I gave him. So again, good night.
    I must be cruel, only to be kind;
  
  Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.
    One word more, good lady.
  Queen. What shall I d
o?
  Ham. Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
    Let the bloat King tempt you again to bed;

    Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
    And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,

    Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,
    Make you to ravel all this matter out,

    That I essentially am not in madness,
    But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;
   
 For who that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
    Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib
    Su
ch dear concernings hide? Who would do so?
    No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
    Unpeg the 
basket on the house's top,
    Let the birds fly, and like the famous ape,
    To try conclusions,
 in the basket creep
    And break your own neck down.
  Queen. Be thou assur'd, if words be made 
of breath,
    And breath of life, I have no life to breathe
    What thou hast said to me.
  Ham
. I must to England; you know that?
  Queen. Alack,
    I had forgot! 'Tis so concluded on.
  Ham
. There's letters seal'd; and my two schoolfellows,
    Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,

    They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way
    And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
   
 For 'tis the sport to have the enginer
    Hoist with his own petar; and 't shall go hard
    But
 I will delve one yard below their mines
    And blow them at the moon. O, 'tis most sweet
    Whe
n in one line two crafts directly meet.
    This man shall set me packing.
    I'll lug the guts i
nto the neighbour room.-
    Mother, good night.- Indeed, this counsellor
    Is now most still, m
ost secret, and most grave,
    Who was in life a foolish peating knave.
    Come, sir, to draw to
ward an end with you.
    Good night, mother.
                  [Exit the Queen. Then] Exit Hamlet
, tugging in
                                                       Polonius.

ACT IV. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King and Queen, with Rosencrantz and Guil
denstern.

  King. There's matter in these sighs. These profound heaves
    You must translate; '
tis fit we understand them.
    Where is your son?
  Queen. Bestow this place on us a little while
.
                          [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
    Ah, mine own lord, what hav
e I seen to-night!
  King. What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
  Queen. Mad as the sea and wind when 
both contend
    Which is the mightier. In his lawless fit
    Behind the arras hearing something 
stir,
    Whips out his rapier, cries 'A rat, a rat!'
    And in this brainish apprehension kills

    The unseen good old man.
  King. O heavy deed!
    It had been so with us, had we been there.

    His liberty is full of threats to all-
    To you yourself, to us, to every one.
    Alas, h
ow shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
    It will be laid to us, whose providence
    Should have
 kept short, restrain'd, and out of haunt
    This mad young man. But so much was our love
    We 
would not understand what was most fit,
    But, like the owner of a foul disease,
    To keep it 
from divulging, let it feed
    Even on the pith of life. Where is he gone?
  Queen. To draw apart
 the body he hath kill'd;
    O'er whom his very madness, like some ore
    Among a mineral of met
als base,
    Shows itself pure. He weeps for what is done.
  King. O Gertrude, come away!
    Th
e sun no sooner shall the mountains touch
    But we will ship him hence; and this vile deed
    W
e must with all our majesty and skill
    Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!

       
      Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

    Friends both, go join you with some further aid.
 
   Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
    And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him.
  
  Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body
    Into the chapel. I pray you haste in this.
 
                         Exeunt [Rosencrantz and Guildenstern].
    Come, Gertrude, we'll call up o
ur wisest friends
    And let them know both what we mean to do
    And what's untimely done. [So 
haply slander-]
    Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter,
    As level as the cannon to his bla
nk,
    Transports his poisoned shot- may miss our name
    And hit the woundless air.- O, come aw
ay!
    My soul is full of discord and dismay.
                                                   
      Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A passage in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Safe
ly stow'd.
  Gentlemen. (within) Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!
  Ham. But soft! What noise? Who calls on Ha
mlet? O, here they
come.

               Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Ros. What have 
you done, my lord, with the dead body?
  Ham. Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
  Ros. Te
ll us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
    And bear it to the chapel.
  Ham. Do not believe 
it.
  Ros. Believe what?
  Ham. That I can keep your counsel, and not mine own. Besides,
to be
 
   demanded of a sponge, what replication should be made by the
son
    of a king?
  Ros. Take yo
u me for a sponge, my lord?
  Ham. Ay, sir; that soaks up the King's countenance, his
rewards,
  
  his authorities. But such officers do the King best service
in
    the end. He keeps them, like 
an ape, in the corner of his
jaw;
    first mouth'd, to be last swallowed. When he needs what you

have
    glean'd, it is but squeezing you and, sponge, you shall be
dry
    again.
  Ros. I und
erstand you not, my lord.
  Ham. I am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.
  Ros.
 My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us
to
    the King.
  Ham. The body is w
ith the King, but the King is not with the
body.
    The King is a thing-
  Guil. A thing, my lor

  Ham. Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.
                                  
                       Exeunt.




Scene III.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King.


  King. I have sent to seek him and to find the body.
    How dangerous is it that this man goes 
loose!
    Yet must not we put the strong law on him.
    He's lov'd of the distracted multitude,

    Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;
    And where 'tis so, th' offender's scourge 
is weigh'd,
    But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,
    This sudden sending him aw
ay must seem
    Deliberate pause. Diseases desperate grown
    By desperate appliance are reliev'
d,
    Or not at all.

                    Enter Rosencrantz.

    How now O What hath befall'n
?
  Ros. Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
    We cannot get from him.
  King. But where 
is he?
  Ros. Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
  King. Bring him before us.
  Ro
s. Ho, Guildenstern! Bring in my lord.

        Enter Hamlet and Guildenstern [with Attendants].


  King. Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
  Ham. At supper.
  King. At supper? Where?
  Ham. Not w
here he eats, but where he is eaten. A certain
    convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Yo
ur worm is
your
    only emperor for diet. We fat all creatures else to fat us,
and
    we fat o
urselves for maggots. Your fat king and your lean
beggar
    is but variable service- two dishes, 
but to one table. That's
the
    end.
  King. Alas, alas!
  Ham. A man may fish with the worm th
at hath eat of a king, and
eat
    of the fish that hath fed of that worm.
  King. What dost thou
 mean by this?
  Ham. Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress
through
    the guts o
f a beggar.
  King. Where is Polonius?
  Ham. In heaven. Send thither to see. If your messenger fi
nd him
not
    there, seek him i' th' other place yourself. But indeed, if
you
    find him not 
within this month, you shall nose him as you go
up
    the stair, into the lobby.
  King. Go seek
 him there. [To Attendants.]
  Ham. He will stay till you come.
                                  
          [Exeunt Attendants.]
  King. Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,-
    Which we
 do tender as we dearly grieve
    For that which thou hast done,- must send thee hence
    With f
iery quickness. Therefore prepare thyself.
    The bark is ready and the wind at help,
    Th' ass
ociates tend, and everything is bent
    For England.
  Ham. For England?
  King. Ay, Hamlet.
  
Ham. Good.
  King. So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
  Ham. I see a cherub that sees them. B
ut come, for England!
    Farewell, dear mother.
  King. Thy loving father, Hamlet.
  Ham. My mot
her! Father and mother is man and wife; man and wife
is
    one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, fo
r England!
Exit.
  King. Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard.
    Delay it not; I'll 
have him hence to-night.
    Away! for everything is seal'd and done
    That else leans on th' af
fair. Pray you make haste.
                            Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]
    An
d, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught,-
    As my great power thereof may give thee sense,

    Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
    After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
    Pay
s homage to us,- thou mayst not coldly set
    Our sovereign process, which imports at full,
    B
y letters congruing to that effect,
    The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;
    For like 
the hectic in my blood he rages,
    And thou must cure me. Till I know 'tis done,
    Howe'er my 
haps, my joys were ne'er begun.             Exit.

Scene IV.
Near Elsinore.


Enter Fortinbras with his Army over the stage.

  For. Go, Captain, from me greet the Danish king.

    Tell him that by his license Fortinbras
    Craves the conveyance of a promis'd march
    Ov
er his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.
    If that his Majesty would aught with us,
    We shall
 express our duty in his eye;
    And let him know so.
  Capt. I will do't, my lord.
  For. Go so
ftly on.
                                   Exeunt [all but the Captain].

       Enter Hamlet, R
osencrantz, [Guildenstern,] and others.

  Ham. Good sir, whose powers are these?
  Capt. They ar
e of Norway, sir.
  Ham. How purpos'd, sir, I pray you?
  Capt. Against some part of Poland.
  Ha
m. Who commands them, sir?
  Capt. The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.
  Ham. Goes it against th
e main of Poland, sir,
    Or for some frontier?
  Capt. Truly to speak, and with no addition,
  
  We go to gain a little patch of ground
    That hath in it no profit but the name.
    To pay fi
ve ducats, five, I would not farm it;
    Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
    A ranker rat
e, should it be sold in fee.
  Ham. Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
  Capt. Yes, it is 
already garrison'd.
  Ham. Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
    Will not debate the q
uestion of this straw.
    This is th' imposthume of much wealth and peace,
    That inward breaks
, and shows no cause without
    Why the man dies.- I humbly thank you, sir.

u, sir.                             [Exit.]
  Ros. Will't please you go, my lord?
  Ham. I'll be w

    How all occasions do inform against me
    And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
    I
f his chief good and market of his time
    Be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.
    Sure h
e that made us with such large discourse,
    Looking before and after, gave us not
    That capab
ility and godlike reason
    To fust in us unus'd. Now, whether it be
    Bestial oblivion, or som
e craven scruple
    Of thinking too precisely on th' event,-
    A thought which, quarter'd, hath
 but one part wisdom
    And ever three parts coward,- I do not know
    Why yet I live to say 'Th
is thing's to do,'
    Sith I have cause, and will, and strength, and means
    To do't. Examples 
gross as earth exhort me.
    Witness this army of such mass and charge,
    Led by a delicate and
 tender prince,
    Whose spirit, with divine ambition puff'd,
    Makes mouths at the invisible e
vent,
    Exposing what is mortal and unsure
    To all that fortune, death, and danger dare,
   
 Even for an eggshell. Rightly to be great
    Is not to stir without great argument,
    But grea
tly to find quarrel in a straw
    When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,
    That have a f
ather kill'd, a mother stain'd,
    Excitements of my reason and my blood,
    And let all sleep, 
while to my shame I see
    The imminent death of twenty thousand men
    That for a fantasy and t
rick of fame
    Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot
    Whereon the numbers cannot try
 the cause,
    Which is not tomb enough and continent
    To hide the slain? O, from this time fo
rth,
    My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!            Exit.

Scene V.

Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter Horatio, Queen, and a Gentleman.

  Queen. I will not s
peak with her.
  Gent. She is importunate, indeed distract.
    Her mood will needs be pitied.
  
Queen. What would she have?
  Gent. She speaks much of her father; says she hears
    There's tric
ks i' th' world, and hems, and beats her heart;
    Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in do
ubt,
    That carry but half sense. Her speech is nothing,
    Yet the unshaped use of it doth mov
e
    The hearers to collection; they aim at it,
    And botch the words up fit to their own thoug
hts;
    Which, as her winks and nods and gestures yield them,
    Indeed would make one think the
re might be thought,
    Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
  Hor. 'Twere good she were spok
en with; for she may strew
    Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.
  Queen. Let her come 
in.
                                               [Exit Gentleman.]
    [Aside] To my sick soul (
as sin's true nature is)
    Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
    So full of artless j
ealousy is guilt
    It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.

                 Enter Ophelia dis
tracted.

  Oph. Where is the beauteous Majesty of Denmark?
  Queen. How now, Ophelia?
  Oph. (s
ings)
         How should I your true-love know
           From another one?
         By his cock
le bat and' staff
           And his sandal shoon.

  Queen. Alas, sweet lady, what imports this 
song?
  Oph. Say you? Nay, pray You mark.

    (Sings) He is dead and gone, lady,
              
He is dead and gone;
            At his head a grass-green turf,
              At his heels a ston
e.

    O, ho!
  Queen. Nay, but Ophelia-
  Oph. Pray you mark.

    (Sings) White his shroud 
as the mountain snow-

                    Enter King.

  Queen. Alas, look here, my lord!
  Op
h. (Sings)
           Larded all with sweet flowers;
         Which bewept to the grave did not go

           With true-love showers.

  King. How do you, pretty lady?
  Oph. Well, God dild you!
 They say the owl was a baker's
daughter.
    Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we may 
be. God
be at
    your table!
  King. Conceit upon her father.
  Oph. Pray let's have no words o
f this; but when they ask, you
what
    it means, say you this:

    (Sings) To-morrow is Saint 
Valentine's day,
              All in the morning bedtime,
            And I a maid at your window
,
              To be your Valentine.

            Then up he rose and donn'd his clo'es
       
       And dupp'd the chamber door,
            Let in the maid, that out a maid
              Nev
er departed more.

  King. Pretty Ophelia!
  Oph. Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end o
n't!

    [Sings] By Gis and by Saint Charity,
              Alack, and fie for shame!
         
   Young men will do't if they come to't
              By Cock, they are to blame.

            Q
uoth she, 'Before you tumbled me,
              You promis'd me to wed.'

    He answers:

    
        'So would I 'a' done, by yonder sun,
              An thou hadst not come to my bed.'

  
King. How long hath she been thus?
  Oph. I hope all will be well. We must be patient; but I cannot

    choose but weep to think they would lay him i' th' cold
ground.
    My brother shall know of
 it; and so I thank you for your good
    counsel. Come, my coach! Good night, ladies. Good night,

sweet
    ladies. Good night, good night.                         Exit
  King. Follow her close; 
give her good watch, I pray you.
                                                 [Exit Horatio.]


    O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs
    All from her father's death. O Gertrude, 
Gertrude,
    When sorrows come, they come not single spies.
    But in battalions! First, her fat
her slain;
    Next, your son gone, and he most violent author
    Of his own just remove; the peo
ple muddied,
    Thick and and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers
    For good Polonius' d
eath, and we have done but greenly
    In hugger-mugger to inter him; poor Ophelia
    Divided fro
m herself and her fair judgment,
    Without the which we are pictures or mere beasts;
    Last, a
nd as much containing as all these,
    Her brother is in secret come from France;
    And wants n
ot buzzers to infect his ear
    Feeds on his wonder, keep, himself in clouds,
    With pestilent 
speeches of his father's death,
    Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
    Will nothing stick 
our person to arraign
    In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
    Like to a murd'ring piece,
 in many places
    Give me superfluous death.                  A noise within.
  Queen. Alack, wh
at noise is this?
  King. Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.

                     E
nter a Messenger.

    What is the matter?
  Mess. Save Yourself, my lord:
    The ocean, overpe
ering of his list,
    Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
    Than Young Laertes, in a r
iotous head,
    O'erbears Your offices. The rabble call him lord;
    And, as the world were now 
but to begin,
    Antiquity forgot, custom not known,
    The ratifiers and props of every word,

    They cry 'Choose we! Laertes shall be king!'
    Caps, hands, and tongues applaud it to the clo
uds,
    'Laertes shall be king! Laertes king!'
                                                 A
 noise within.
  Queen. How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!
    O, this is counter, you fa
lse Danish dogs!
  King. The doors are broke.

                    Enter Laertes with others.


  Laer. Where is this king?- Sirs, staid you all without.
  All. No, let's come in!
  Laer. I pray
 you give me leave.
  All. We will, we will!
  Laer. I thank you. Keep the door.      [Exeunt his 
Followers.]
    O thou vile king,
    Give me my father!
  Queen. Calmly, good Laertes.
  Laer. 
That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard;
    Cries cuckold to my father; brands the har
lot
    Even here between the chaste unsmirched brows
    Of my true mother.
  King. What is the 
cause, Laertes,
    That thy rebellion looks so giantlike?
    Let him go, Gertrude. Do not fear o
ur person.
    There's such divinity doth hedge a king
    That treason can but peep to what it wo
uld,
    Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,
    Why thou art thus incens'd. Let him go, Ge
rtrude.
    Speak, man.
  Laer. Where is my father?
  King. Dead.
  Queen. But not by him!
  Ki
ng. Let him demand his fill.
  Laer. How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
    To hell, alle
giance! vows, to the blackest devil
    Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
    I dare d
amnation. To this point I stand,
    That both the world, I give to negligence,
    Let come what 
comes; only I'll be reveng'd
    Most throughly for my father.
  King. Who shall stay you?
  Laer
. My will, not all the world!
    And for my means, I'll husband them so well
    They shall go fa
r with little.
  King. Good Laertes,
    If you desire to know the certainty
    Of your dear fat
her's death, is't writ in your revenge
    That sweepstake you will draw both friend and foe,
    
Winner and loser?
  Laer. None but his enemies.
  King. Will you know them then?
  Laer. To his g
ood friends thus wide I'll ope my arms
    And, like the kind life-rend'ring pelican,
    Repast t
hem with my blood.
  King. Why, now You speak
    Like a good child and a true gentleman.
    Tha
t I am guiltless of your father's death,
    And am most sensibly in grief for it,
    It shall as
 level to your judgment pierce
    As day does to your eye.
                              A noise 
within: 'Let her come in.'
  Laer. How now? What noise is that?

                      Enter Ophe
lia.

    O heat, dry up my brains! Tears seven times salt
    Burn out the sense and virtue of m
ine eye!
    By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight
    Till our scale turn the beam. O ro
se of May!
    Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
    O heavens! is't possible a young maid's 
wits
    Should be as mortal as an old man's life?
    Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine
,
    It sends some precious instance of itself
    After the thing it loves.

  Oph. (sings)
 
        They bore him barefac'd on the bier
           (Hey non nony, nony, hey nony)
         And
 in his grave rain'd many a tear.

    Fare you well, my dove!
  Laer. Hadst thou thy wits, and d
idst persuade revenge,
    It could not move thus.
  Oph. You must sing 'A-down a-down, and you ca
ll him a-down-a.'
O,
    how the wheel becomes it! It is the false steward, that stole
his
    m
aster's daughter.
  Laer. This nothing's more than matter.
  Oph. There's rosemary, that's for rem
embrance. Pray you, love,
    remember. And there is pansies, that's for thoughts.
  Laer. A docum
ent in madness! Thoughts and remembrance fitted.
  Oph. There's fennel for you, and columbines. The
re's rue for
you,
    and here's some for me. We may call it herb of grace o'
Sundays.
    O, yo
u must wear your rue with a difference! There's a daisy.
I
    would give you some violets, but th
ey wither'd all when my
father
    died. They say he made a good end.

    [Sings] For bonny swe
et Robin is all my joy.

  Laer. Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,
    She turns to f
avour and to prettiness.
  Oph. (sings)
         And will he not come again?
         And will he
 not come again?
           No, no, he is dead;
           Go to thy deathbed;
         He never 
will come again.

         His beard was as white as snow,
         All flaxen was his poll.
   
        He is gone, he is gone,
           And we cast away moan.
         God 'a'mercy on his sou
l!

    And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God b' wi' you.
Exit.
  Laer. Do you see this, O
 God?
  King. Laertes, I must commune with your grief,
    Or you deny me right. Go but apart,
  
  Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will,
    And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you an
d me.
    If by direct or by collateral hand
    They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,

    Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours,
    To you in satisfaction; but if not,
    Be
 you content to lend your patience to us,
    And we shall jointly labour with your soul
    To gi
ve it due content.
  Laer. Let this be so.
    His means of death, his obscure funeral-
    No tr
ophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,
    No noble rite nor formal ostentation,-
    Cry to b
e heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
    That I must call't in question.
  King. So you shall;

    And where th' offence is let the great axe fall.
    I pray you go with me.
                
                                          Exeunt

atio, when thou shalt have
overlook'd
    this, give these fellows some means to the King. They ha
ve
    letters for him. Ere we were two days old at sea, a pirate of

    very warlike appointmen
t gave us chase. Finding ourselves too
    slow of sail, we put on a compelled valour, and in the

grapple I
    boarded them. On the instant they got clear of our ship; so I
    alone became their
 prisoner. They have dealt with me like
thieves
    of mercy; but they knew what they did: I am to
 do a good turn
for
    them. Let the King have the letters I have sent, and repair
thou
    to 
me with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death. I have
words
    to speak in thine ear will make 
thee dumb; yet are they much
too
    light for the bore of the matter. These good fellows will
br
ing
    thee where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their
course
    for England. Of them 
I have much to tell thee. Farewell.
                            'He that thou knowest thine, HAMLET

    Come, I will give you way for these your letters,
    And do't the speedier that you may 
direct me
    To him from whom you brought them.                   Exeunt.

Sce
ne VII.
Elsinore. Another room in the Castle.

Enter King and Laertes.

  King. Now must your c
onscience my acquittance seal,
    And You must put me in your heart for friend,
    Sith you have
 heard, and with a knowing ear,
    That he which hath your noble father slain
    Pursued my life
.
  Laer. It well appears. But tell me
    Why you proceeded not against these feats
    So crime
ful and so capital in nature,
    As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
    You mainly were 
stirr'd up.
  King. O, for two special reasons,
    Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd
,
    But yet to me they are strong. The Queen his mother
    Lives almost by his looks; and for m
yself,-
    My virtue or my plague, be it either which,-
    She's so conjunctive to my life and s
oul
    That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
    I could not but by her. The other motiv
e
    Why to a public count I might not go
    Is the great love the general gender bear him,
   
 Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
    Would, like the spring that turneth wood to st
one,
    Convert his gives to graces; so that my arrows,
    Too slightly timber'd for so loud a w
ind,
    Would have reverted to my bow again,
    And not where I had aim'd them.
  Laer. And so 
have I a noble father lost;
    A sister driven into desp'rate terms,
    Whose worth, if praises 
may go back again,
    Stood challenger on mount of all the age
    For her perfections. But my re
venge will come.
  King. Break not your sleeps for that. You must not think
    That we are made o
f stuff so flat and dull
    That we can let our beard be shook with danger,
    And think it past
ime. You shortly shall hear more.
    I lov'd your father, and we love ourself,
    And that, I ho
pe, will teach you to imagine-

                 Enter a Messenger with letters.

    How now? W
hat news?
  Mess. Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:
    This to your Majesty; this to the Queen.
  K
ing. From Hamlet? Who brought them?
  Mess. Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not.
    They w
ere given me by Claudio; he receiv'd them
    Of him that brought them.
  King. Laertes, you shall
 hear them.
    Leave us.
                                                 Exit Messenger.
    [R
eads]'High and Mighty,-You shall know I am set naked on
your
    kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg le
ave to see your kingly eyes;
    when I shall (first asking your pardon thereunto) recount the
   
 occasion of my sudden and more strange return.
                                                   
  'HAMLET.'
    What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?
    Or is it some abuse, and no
 such thing?
  Laer. Know you the hand?
  King. 'Tis Hamlet's character. 'Naked!'
    And in a po
stscript here, he says 'alone.'
    Can you advise me?
  Laer. I am lost in it, my lord. But let h
im come!
    It warms the very sickness in my heart
    That I shall live and tell him to his teet
h,
    'Thus didest thou.'
  King. If it be so, Laertes
    (As how should it be so? how otherwis
e?),
    Will you be rul'd by me?
  Laer. Ay my lord,
    So you will not o'errule me to a peace.

  King. To thine own peace. If he be now return'd
    As checking at his voyage, and that he mean
s
    No more to undertake it, I will work him
    To exploit now ripe in my device,
    Under th
e which he shall not choose but fall;
    And for his death no wind shall breathe
    But even his
 mother shall uncharge the practice
    And call it accident.
  Laer. My lord, I will be rul'd;
 
   The rather, if you could devise it so
    That I might be the organ.
  King. It falls right.
 
   You have been talk'd of since your travel much,
    And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality

    Wherein they say you shine, Your sum of parts
    Did not together pluck such envy from him
 
   As did that one; and that, in my regard,
    Of the unworthiest siege.
  Laer. What part is tha
t, my lord?
  King. A very riband in the cap of youth-
    Yet needfull too; for youth no less bec
omes
    The light and careless livery that it wears
    Than settled age his sables and his weeds
,
    Importing health and graveness. Two months since
    Here was a gentleman of Normandy.
    
I have seen myself, and serv'd against, the French,
    And they can well on horseback; but this ga
llant
    Had witchcraft in't. He grew unto his seat,
    And to such wondrous doing brought his h
orse
    As had he been incorps'd and demi-natur'd
    With the brave beast. So far he topp'd my t
hought
    That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
    Come short of what he did.
  Laer. A Norm
an was't?
  King. A Norman.
  Laer. Upon my life, Lamound.
  King. The very same.
  Laer. I know
 him well. He is the broach indeed
    And gem of all the nation.
  King. He made confession of yo
u;
    And gave you such a masterly report
    For art and exercise in your defence,
    And for 
your rapier most especially,
    That he cried out 'twould be a sight indeed
    If one could matc
h you. The scrimers of their nation
    He swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
    If you op
pos'd them. Sir, this report of his
    Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
    That he could noth
ing do but wish and beg
    Your sudden coming o'er to play with you.
    Now, out of this-
  Lae
r. What out of this, my lord?
  King. Laertes, was your father dear to you?
    Or are you like th
e painting of a sorrow,
    A face without a heart,'
  Laer. Why ask you this?
  King. Not that I
 think you did not love your father;
    But that I know love is begun by time,
    And that I see
, in passages of proof,
    Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
    There lives within the ve
ry flame of love
    A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
    And nothing is at a like good
ness still;
    For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
    Dies in his own too-much. That we would do
,
    We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes,
    And hath abatements and delays as 
many
    As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
    And then this 'should' is like a spen
dthrift sigh,
    That hurts by easing. But to the quick o' th' ulcer!
    Hamlet comes back. What
 would you undertake
    To show yourself your father's son in deed
    More than in words?
  Lae
r. To cut his throat i' th' church!
  King. No place indeed should murther sanctuarize;
    Reveng
e should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,
    Will you do this? Keep close within your chamber.

    Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home.
    We'll put on those shall praise your excellen
ce
    And set a double varnish on the fame
    The Frenchman gave you; bring you in fine together

    And wager on your heads. He, being remiss,
    Most generous, and free from all contriving,

    Will not peruse the foils; so that with ease,
    Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
 
   A sword unbated, and, in a pass of practice,
    Requite him for your father.
  Laer. I will do
't!
    And for that purpose I'll anoint my sword.
    I bought an unction of a mountebank,
    S
o mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
    Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
    Collected
 from all simples that have virtue
    Under the moon, can save the thing from death
    This is b
ut scratch'd withal. I'll touch my point
    With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
  
  It may be death.
  King. Let's further think of this,
    Weigh what convenience both of time an
d means
    May fit us to our shape. If this should fall,
    And that our drift look through our 
bad performance.
    'Twere better not assay'd. Therefore this project
    Should have a back or s
econd, that might hold
    If this did blast in proof. Soft! let me see.
    We'll make a solemn w
ager on your cunnings-
    I ha't!
    When in your motion you are hot and dry-
    As make your 
bouts more violent to that end-
    And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepar'd him
    A chal
ice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,
    If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
    Our pur
pose may hold there.- But stay, what noise,

                           Enter Queen.

    How no
w, sweet queen?
  Queen. One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
    So fast they follow. Your sis
ter's drown'd, Laertes.
  Laer. Drown'd! O, where?
  Queen. There is a willow grows aslant a brook
,
    That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream.
    There with fantastic garlands did she c
ome
    Of crowflowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,
    That liberal shepherds give a gros
ser name,
    But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them.
    There on the pendant boughs 
her coronet weeds
    Clamb'ring to hang, an envious sliver broke,
    When down her weedy trophie
s and herself
    Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide
    And, mermaid-like, awhile
 they bore her up;
    Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes,
    As one incapable of her 
own distress,
    Or like a creature native and indued
    Unto that element; but long it could no
t be
    Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
    Pull'd the poor wretch from her melod
ious lay
    To muddy death.
  Laer. Alas, then she is drown'd?
  Queen. Drown'd, drown'd.
  Lae
r. Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
    And therefore I forbid my tears; but yet
    It 
is our trick; nature her custom holds,
    Let shame say what it will. When these are gone,
    Th
e woman will be out. Adieu, my lord.
    I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze
    But th
at this folly douts it.                          Exit.
  King. Let's follow, Gertrude.
    How muc
h I had to do to calm his rage I
    Now fear I this will give it start again;
    Therefore let's
 follow.
                                                         Exeunt.

ACT 
V. Scene I.
Elsinore. A churchyard.

Enter two Clowns, [with spades and pickaxes].

  Clown. Is
 she to be buried in Christian burial when she
wilfully
    seeks her own salvation?
  Other. I t
ell thee she is; therefore make her grave straight.
    The crowner hath sate on her, and finds it 
Christian burial.
  Clown. How can that be, unless she drown'd herself in her own
    defence?
  
Other. Why, 'tis found so.
  Clown. It must be se offendendo; it cannot be else. For here
lies
  
  the point: if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act; and
an
    act hath three branches-it 
is to act, to do, and to perform;
    argal, she drown'd herself wittingly.
  Other. Nay, but hear
 you, Goodman Delver!
  Clown. Give me leave. Here lies the water; good. Here stands
the
    man;
 good. If the man go to this water and drown himself, it
is,
    will he nill he, he goes- mark yo
u that. But if the water
come to
    him and drown him, he drowns not himself. Argal, he that is

not
    guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.
  Other. But is this law?
  Clown. Ay,
 marry, is't- crowner's quest law.
  Other. Will you ha' the truth an't? If this had not been a
  
  gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o' Christian
burial.
  Clown. Why, there thou say's
t! And the more pity that great
folk
    should have count'nance in this world to drown or hang
t
hemselves
    more than their even-Christian. Come, my spade! There is no
    ancient gentlemen bu
t gard'ners, ditchers, and grave-makers.
They
    hold up Adam's profession.
  Other. Was he a ge
ntleman?
  Clown. 'A was the first that ever bore arms.
  Other. Why, he had none.
  Clown. What,
 art a heathen? How dost thou understand the
Scripture?
    The Scripture says Adam digg'd. Could 
he dig without arms?
I'll
    put another question to thee. If thou answerest me not to the
    p
urpose, confess thyself-
  Other. Go to!
  Clown. What is he that builds stronger than either the 
mason,
the
    shipwright, or the carpenter?
  Other. The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives 
a thousand
    tenants.
  Clown. I like thy wit well, in good faith. The gallows does
well.
    
But how does it well? It does well to those that do ill. Now,
    thou dost ill to say the gallows 
is built stronger than the
    church. Argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To't again,
come!

  Other. Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a
    carpenter?
  Clown. Ay, tell me 
that, and unyoke.
  Other. Marry, now I can tell!
  Clown. To't.
  Other. Mass, I cannot tell.


                 Enter Hamlet and Horatio afar off.

  Clown. Cudgel thy brains no more about it,
 for your dull ass
will
    not mend his pace with beating; and when you are ask'd this
    quest
ion next, say 'a grave-maker.' The houses he makes lasts
    till doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan
; fetch me a stoup of
    liquor.
                                            [Exit Second Clown.]



                       [Clown digs and] sings.

       In youth when I did love, did love,

         Methought it was very sweet;
       To contract- O- the time for- a- my behove,
         
O, methought there- a- was nothing- a- meet.

  Ham. Has this fellow no feeling of his business, t
hat he sings
at
    grave-making?
  Hor. Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.
  Ha
m. 'Tis e'en so. The hand of little employment hath the
daintier
    sense.
  Clown. (sings)
   
      But age with his stealing steps
           Hath clawed me in his clutch,
         And hath s
hipped me intil the land,
           As if I had never been such.
                                
            [Throws up a skull.]

  Ham. That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once. How

the
    knave jowls it to the ground,as if 'twere Cain's jawbone,
that
    did the first murther!
 This might be the pate of a
Politician,
    which this ass now o'erreaches; one that would circum
vent
God,
    might it not?
  Hor. It might, my lord.
  Ham. Or of a courtier, which could say '
Good morrow, sweet
lord!
    How dost thou, good lord?' This might be my Lord Such-a-one,
that
 
   prais'd my Lord Such-a-one's horse when he meant to beg it-
might
    it not?
  Hor. Ay, my lo
rd.
  Ham. Why, e'en so! and now my Lady Worm's, chapless, and
knock'd
    about the mazzard with
 a sexton's spade. Here's fine
revolution,
    and we had the trick to see't. Did these bones cost
 no more
the
    breeding but to play at loggets with 'em? Mine ache to think
    on't.
  Clown.
 (Sings)
         A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,
           For and a shrouding sheet;
         
O, a Pit of clay for to be made
           For such a guest is meet.
                             
         Throws up [another skull].

  Ham. There's another. Why may not that be the skull of a
l
awyer?
    Where be his quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, his
tenures,
    and his tricks? W
hy does he suffer this rude knave now to
knock
    him about the sconce with a dirty shovel, and w
ill not tell
him
    of his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be in's time
a
    great b
uyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizances,
his
    fines, his double vouchers, his recove
ries. Is this the fine
of
    his fines, and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his
fine
  
  pate full of fine dirt? Will his vouchers vouch him no more
of
    his purchases, and double one
s too, than the length and
breadth
    of a pair of indentures? The very conveyances of his lands

will
    scarcely lie in this box; and must th' inheritor himself have
no
    more, ha?
  Hor. 
Not a jot more, my lord.
  Ham. Is not parchment made of sheepskins?
  Hor. Ay, my lord, And of ca
lveskins too.
  Ham. They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in
that. I
    will speak
 to this fellow. Whose grave's this, sirrah?
  Clown. Mine, sir.

    [Sings] O, a pit of clay fo
r to be made
              For such a guest is meet.

  Ham. I think it be thine indeed, for thou
 liest in't.
  Clown. You lie out on't, sir, and therefore 'tis not yours.
    For my part, I do n
ot lie in't, yet it is mine.
  Ham. Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine. 'Tis
for

    the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.
  Clown. 'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away 
again from me to you.
  Ham. What man dost thou dig it for?
  Clown. For no man, sir.
  Ham. What
 woman then?
  Clown. For none neither.
  Ham. Who is to be buried in't?
  Clown. One that was a 
woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's
dead.
  Ham. How absolute the knave is! We must speak by the
 card, or
    equivocation will undo us. By the Lord, Horatio, this three
years
    I have taken 
note of it, the age is grown so picked that the
toe
    of the peasant comes so near the heel of t
he courtier he
galls
    his kibe.- How long hast thou been a grave-maker?
  Clown. Of all the da
ys i' th' year, I came to't that day that
our
    last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.
  Ham. Ho
w long is that since?
  Clown. Cannot you tell that? Every fool can tell that. It was
the
    ver
y day that young Hamlet was born- he that is mad, and sent
    into England.
  Ham. Ay, marry, why
 was be sent into England?
  Clown. Why, because 'a was mad. 'A shall recover his wits
there;
   
 or, if 'a do not, 'tis no great matter there.
  Ham. Why?
  Clown. 'Twill not he seen in him ther
e. There the men are as
mad as
    he.
  Ham. How came he mad?
  Clown. Very strangely, they say
.
  Ham. How strangely?
  Clown. Faith, e'en with losing his wits.
  Ham. Upon what ground?
  Cl
own. Why, here in Denmark. I have been sexton here, man and
boy
    thirty years.
  Ham. How long
 will a man lie i' th' earth ere he rot?
  Clown. Faith, if 'a be not rotten before 'a die (as we h
ave
many
    pocky corses now-a-days that will scarce hold the laying in,
I
    will last you so
me eight year or nine year. A tanner will
last
    you nine year.
  Ham. Why he more than another
?
  Clown. Why, sir, his hide is so tann'd with his trade that 'a
will
    keep out water a great
 while; and your water is a sore
decayer of
    your whoreson dead body. Here's a skull now. This 
skull hath
lien
    you i' th' earth three-and-twenty years.
  Ham. Whose was it?
  Clown. A who
reson, mad fellow's it was. Whose do you think it
was?
  Ham. Nay, I know not.
  Clown. A pestile
nce on him for a mad rogue! 'A pour'd a flagon
of
    Rhenish on my head once. This same skull, si
r, was Yorick's
    skull, the King's jester.
  Ham. This?
  Clown. E'en that.
  Ham. Let me see
. [Takes the skull.] Alas, poor Yorick! I knew
him,
    Horatio. A fellow of infinite jest, of mos
t excellent fancy.
He
    hath borne me on his back a thousand times. And now how
abhorred
    i
n my imagination it is! My gorge rises at it. Here hung
those
    lips that I have kiss'd I know n
ot how oft. Where be your
gibes
    now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment that

    were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock
your
    own grinning? Quite chap-
 fall'n? Now get you to my lady's
    chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this

    favour she must come. Make her laugh at that. Prithee,
Horatio,
    tell me one thing.
  Hor.
 What's that, my lord?
  Ham. Dost thou think Alexander look'd o' this fashion i' th'
earth?
  Ho
r. E'en so.
  Ham. And smelt so? Pah!
                                          [Puts down the sku
ll.]
  Hor. E'en so, my lord.
  Ham. To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not
    im
agination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it
    stopping a bunghole?
  Hor. 'Twere
 to consider too curiously, to consider so.
  Ham. No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither 
with
modesty
    enough, and likelihood to lead it; as thus: Alexander died,
    Alexander was bu
ried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust
is
    earth; of earth we make loam; and why of that
 loam (whereto
he
    was converted) might they not stop a beer barrel?
    Imperious Caesar, dea
d and turn'd to clay,
    Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.
    O, that that earth which ke
pt the world in awe
    Should patch a wall t' expel the winter's flaw!
    But soft! but soft! as
ide! Here comes the King-

    Enter [priests with] a coffin [in funeral procession], King,
     
        Queen, Laertes, with Lords attendant.]

    The Queen, the courtiers. Who is this they fol
low?
    And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken
    The corse they follow did with desp'rat
e hand
    Fordo it own life. 'Twas of some estate.
    Couch we awhile, and mark.
              
                           [Retires with Horatio.]

  Laer. What ceremony else?
  Ham. That is La
ertes,
    A very noble youth. Mark.
  Laer. What ceremony else?
  Priest. Her obsequies have bee
n as far enlarg'd
    As we have warranty. Her death was doubtful;
    And, but that great command
 o'ersways the order,
    She should in ground unsanctified have lodg'd
    Till the last trumpet.
 For charitable prayers,
    Shards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on her.
    Yet here she
 is allow'd her virgin rites,
    Her maiden strewments, and the bringing home
    Of bell and bur
ial.
  Laer. Must there no more be done?
  Priest. No more be done.
    We should profane the ser
vice of the dead
    To sing a requiem and such rest to her
    As to peace-parted souls.
  Laer.
 Lay her i' th' earth;
    And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
    May violets spring! I tell t
hee, churlish priest,
    A minist'ring angel shall my sister be
    When thou liest howling.
  H
am. What, the fair Ophelia?
  Queen. Sweets to the sweet! Farewell.
                              
               [Scatters flowers.]
    I hop'd thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
    I tho
ught thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
    And not have strew'd thy grave.
  Laer. O, treb
le woe
    Fall ten times treble on that cursed head
    Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sens
e
    Depriv'd thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,
    Till I have caught her once more in mine ar
ms.
                                             Leaps in the grave.
    Now pile your dust upon t
he quick and dead
    Till of this flat a mountain you have made
    T' o'ertop old Pelion or the 
skyish head
    Of blue Olympus.
  Ham. [comes forward] What is he whose grief
    Bears such an 
emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow
    Conjures the wand'ring stars, and makes them stand
    Like w
onder-wounded hearers? This is I,
    Hamlet the Dane.                    [Leaps in after Laertes.

  Laer. The devil take thy soul!
                                            [Grapples with him].

  Ham. Thou pray'st not well.
    I prithee take thy fingers from my throat;
    For, though I am
 not splenitive and rash,
    Yet have I in me something dangerous,
    Which let thy wisdom fear.
 Hold off thy hand!
  King. Pluck them asunder.
  Queen. Hamlet, Hamlet!
  All. Gentlemen!
  Hor
. Good my lord, be quiet.
             [The Attendants part them, and they come out of the
       
                                                  grave.]
  Ham. Why, I will fight with him upon th
is theme
    Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
  Queen. O my son, what theme?
  Ham. I lov'd O
phelia. Forty thousand brothers
    Could not (with all their quantity of love)
    Make up my sum
. What wilt thou do for her?
  King. O, he is mad, Laertes.
  Queen. For love of God, forbear him!

  Ham. 'Swounds, show me what thou't do.
    Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thys
elf?
    Woo't drink up esill? eat a crocodile?
    I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?
    
To outface me with leaping in her grave?
    Be buried quick with her, and so will I.
    And if t
hou prate of mountains, let them throw
    Millions of acres on us, till our ground,
    Singeing 
his pate against the burning zone,
    Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
    I'll rant
 as well as thou.
  Queen. This is mere madness;
    And thus a while the fit will work on him.
 
   Anon, as patient as the female dove
    When that her golden couplets are disclos'd,
    His si
lence will sit drooping.
  Ham. Hear you, sir!
    What is the reason that you use me thus?
    I
 lov'd you ever. But it is no matter.
    Let Hercules himself do what he may,
    The cat will me
w, and dog will have his day.
Exit.
  King. I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.
           
                                        Exit Horatio.
    [To Laertes] Strengthen your patience in 
our last night's
speech.
    We'll put the matter to the present push.-
    Good Gertrude, set so
me watch over your son.-
    This grave shall have a living monument.
    An hour of quiet shortly
 shall we see;
    Till then in patience our proceeding be.
                                      
                   Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A hall in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet and H
oratio.

  Ham. So much for this, sir; now shall you see the other.
    You do remember all the c
ircumstance?
  Hor. Remember it, my lord!
  Ham. Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting
  
  That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay
    Worse than the mutinies in the bilboes. Rashly-

    And prais'd be rashness for it; let us know,
    Our indiscretion sometime serves us well
   
 When our deep plots do pall; and that should learn us
    There's a divinity that shapes our ends,

    Rough-hew them how we will-
  Hor. That is most certain.
  Ham. Up from my cabin,
    My se
a-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
    Grop'd I to find out them; had my desire,
    Finger'd th
eir packet, and in fine withdrew
    To mine own room again; making so bold
    (My fears forgetti
ng manners) to unseal
    Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio
    (O royal knavery!), a
n exact command,
    Larded with many several sorts of reasons,
    Importing Denmark's health, an
d England's too,
    With, hoo! such bugs and goblins in my life-
    That, on the supervise, no l
eisure bated,
    No, not to stay the finding of the axe,
    My head should be struck off.
  Hor
. Is't possible?
  Ham. Here's the commission; read it at more leisure.
    But wilt thou bear me 
how I did proceed?
  Hor. I beseech you.
  Ham. Being thus benetted round with villanies,
    Or 
I could make a prologue to my brains,
    They had begun the play. I sat me down;
    Devis'd a ne
w commission; wrote it fair.
    I once did hold it, as our statists do,
    A baseness to write f
air, and labour'd much
    How to forget that learning; but, sir, now
    It did me yeoman's servi
ce. Wilt thou know
    Th' effect of what I wrote?
  Hor. Ay, good my lord.
  Ham. An earnest con
juration from the King,
    As England was his faithful tributary,
    As love between them like t
he palm might flourish,
    As peace should still her wheaten garland wear
    And stand a comma '
tween their amities,
    And many such-like as's of great charge,
    That, on the view and knowin
g of these contents,
    Without debatement further, more or less,
    He should the bearers put t
o sudden death,
    Not shriving time allow'd.
  Hor. How was this seal'd?
  Ham. Why, even in th
at was heaven ordinant.
    I had my father's signet in my purse,
    Which was the model of that 
Danish seal;
    Folded the writ up in the form of th' other,
    Subscrib'd it, gave't th' impres
sion, plac'd it safely,
    The changeling never known. Now, the next day
    Was our sea-fight; a
nd what to this was sequent
    Thou know'st already.
  Hor. So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to
't.
  Ham. Why, man, they did make love to this employment!
    They are not near my conscience; t
heir defeat
    Does by their own insinuation grow.
    'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes

    Between the pass and fell incensed points
    Of mighty opposites.
  Hor. Why, what a king i
s this!
  Ham. Does it not, thinks't thee, stand me now upon-
    He that hath kill'd my king, and
 whor'd my mother;
    Popp'd in between th' election and my hopes;
    Thrown out his angle for m
y proper life,
    And with such coz'nage- is't not perfect conscience
    To quit him with this a
rm? And is't not to be damn'd
    To let this canker of our nature come
    In further evil?
  Ho
r. It must be shortly known to him from England
    What is the issue of the business there.
  Ham
. It will be short; the interim is mine,
    And a man's life is no more than to say 'one.'
    Bu
t I am very sorry, good Horatio,
    That to Laertes I forgot myself,
    For by the image of my c
ause I see
    The portraiture of his. I'll court his favours.
    But sure the bravery of his gri
ef did put me
    Into a tow'ring passion.
  Hor. Peace! Who comes here?

                 Enter
 young Osric, a courtier.

  Osr. Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
  Ham. I humbly
 thank you, sir. [Aside to Horatio] Dost know this
    waterfly?
  Hor. [aside to Hamlet] No, my g
ood lord.
  Ham. [aside to Horatio] Thy state is the more gracious; for
'tis a
    vice to know h
im. He hath much land, and fertile. Let a beast
be
    lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at
 the king's mess.
'Tis
    a chough; but, as I say, spacious in the possession of dirt.

  Osr. 
Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should
impart
    a thing to you from his Majesty.

  Ham. I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit. Put
your
    bonnet to his right us
e. 'Tis for the head.
  Osr. I thank your lordship, it is very hot.
  Ham. No, believe me, 'tis ve
ry cold; the wind is northerly.
  Osr. It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
  Ham. But yet met
hinks it is very sultry and hot for my
complexion.
  Osr. Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,
 as 'twere- I
cannot
    tell how. But, my lord, his Majesty bade me signify to you
that
    he 
has laid a great wager on your head. Sir, this is the
matter-
  Ham. I beseech you remember.
    
                       [Hamlet moves him to put on his hat.]
  Osr. Nay, good my lord; for mine eas
e, in good faith. Sir, here
is
    newly come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute
gentleman
,
    full of most excellent differences, of very soft society and
    great showing. Indeed, to s
peak feelingly of him, he is the
card
    or calendar of gentry; for you shall find in him the
co
ntinent of
    what part a gentleman would see.
  Ham. Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in
 you; though, I

    know, to divide him inventorially would dozy th' arithmetic
of
    memory, 
and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail.
    But, in the verity of extolment, I take h
im to be a soul of
great
    article, and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as, to
make
 
   true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror, and who
else
    would trace him, his umbrage
, nothing more.
  Osr. Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
  Ham. The concernancy, sir? W
hy do we wrap the gentleman in our
more
    rawer breath?
  Osr. Sir?
  Hor [aside to Hamlet] Is
't not possible to understand in
another
    tongue? You will do't, sir, really.
  Ham. What impo
rts the nomination of this gentleman?
  Osr. Of Laertes?
  Hor. [aside] His purse is empty already
. All's golden words are
    spent.
  Ham. Of him, sir.
  Osr. I know you are not ignorant-
  Ha
m. I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would
not
    much approve me. Well, sir?

  Osr. You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is-
  Ham. I dare not confess that, lest I s
hould compare with him in
    excellence; but to know a man well were to know himself.
  Osr. I me
an, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on
him
    by them, in his meed he's unfellowe
d.
  Ham. What's his weapon?
  Osr. Rapier and dagger.
  Ham. That's two of his weapons- but well
.
  Osr. The King, sir, hath wager'd with him six Barbary horses;
    against the which he has imp
on'd, as I take it, six French
    rapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers,
a
nd
    so. Three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy,
    very responsive to the hi
lts, most delicate carriages, and of
    very liberal conceit.
  Ham. What call you the carriages?

  Hor. [aside to Hamlet] I knew you must be edified by the
margent
    ere you had done.
  Osr.
 The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
  Ham. The phrase would be more germane to the matter if we c
ould
    carry cannon by our sides. I would it might be hangers till
then.
    But on! Six Barbar
y horses against six French swords, their
    assigns, and three liberal-conceited carriages: that'
s the
French
    bet against the Danish. Why is this all impon'd, as you call
it?
  Osr. The Kin
g, sir, hath laid that, in a dozen passes between
    yourself and him, he shall not exceed you thr
ee hits; he hath
    laid on twelve for nine, and it would come to immediate trial
    if your lor
dship would vouchsafe the answer.
  Ham. How if I answer no?
  Osr. I mean, my lord, the oppositio
n of your person in trial.
  Ham. Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please his
Majesty,
  
  it is the breathing time of day with me. Let the foils be
    brought, the gentleman willing, and
 the King hold his
purpose,
    I will win for him if I can; if not, I will gain nothing but
my

    shame and the odd hits.
  Osr. Shall I redeliver you e'en so?
  Ham. To this effect, sir, afte
r what flourish your nature will.
  Osr. I commend my duty to your lordship.
  Ham. Yours, yours. 
[Exit Osric.] He does well to commend it
    himself; there are no tongues else for's turn.
  Hor.
 This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.
  Ham. He did comply with his dug before he suc
k'd it. Thus has
he,
    and many more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age
dotes
    on,
 only got the tune of the time and outward habit of
encounter-
    a kind of yesty collection, whi
ch carries them through and
    through the most fann'd and winnowed opinions; and do but
blow
  
  them to their trial-the bubbles are out,

                            Enter a Lord.

  Lord. M
y lord, his Majesty commended him to you by young Osric,
who
    brings back to him, that you atte
nd him in the hall. He sends
to
    know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you

will
    take longer time.
  Ham. I am constant to my purposes; they follow the King's
pleasure.

    If his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or whensoever,
provided
    I be so able as now.
 
 Lord. The King and Queen and all are coming down.
  Ham. In happy time.
  Lord. The Queen desires
 you to use some gentle entertainment to
    Laertes before you fall to play.
  Ham. She well inst
ructs me.
                                                    [Exit Lord.]
  Hor. You will lose th
is wager, my lord.
  Ham. I do not think so. Since he went into France I have been
in
    continu
al practice. I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst
not
    think how ill all's here about my h
eart. But it is no matter.
  Hor. Nay, good my lord -
  Ham. It is but foolery; but it is such a k
ind of gaingiving as
    would perhaps trouble a woman.
  Hor. If your mind dislike anything, obey
 it. I will forestall
their
    repair hither and say you are not fit.
  Ham. Not a whit, we defy
 augury; there's a special providence
in
    the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not to come
; if it
be
    not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will
come:
    the readines
s is all. Since no man knows aught of what he
leaves,
    what is't to leave betimes? Let be.

 
   Enter King, Queen, Laertes, Osric, and Lords, with other
              Attendants with foils and
 gauntlets.
               A table and flagons of wine on it.

  King. Come, Hamlet, come, and ta
ke this hand from me.
                    [The King puts Laertes' hand into Hamlet's.]
  Ham. Give
 me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong;
    But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.
    This pr
esence knows,
    And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd
    With sore distraction. What
 I have done
    That might your nature, honour, and exception
    Roughly awake, I here proclaim 
was madness.
    Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet.
    If Hamlet from himself be taken a
way,
    And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
    Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies 
it.
    Who does it, then? His madness. If't be so,
    Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;

    His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
    Sir, in this audience,
    Let my disclaiming from a 
purpos'd evil
    Free me so far in your most generous thoughts
    That I have shot my arrow o'er
 the house
    And hurt my brother.
  Laer. I am satisfied in nature,
    Whose motive in this ca
se should stir me most
    To my revenge. But in my terms of honour
    I stand aloof, and will no
 reconcilement
    Till by some elder masters of known honour
    I have a voice and precedent of 
peace
    To keep my name ungor'd. But till that time
    I do receive your offer'd love like love
,
    And will not wrong it.
  Ham. I embrace it freely,
    And will this brother's wager frankl
y play.
    Give us the foils. Come on.
  Laer. Come, one for me.
  Ham. I'll be your foil, Laert
es. In mine ignorance
    Your skill shall, like a star i' th' darkest night,
    Stick fiery off 
indeed.
  Laer. You mock me, sir.
  Ham. No, by this hand.
  King. Give them the foils, young Osr
ic. Cousin Hamlet,
    You know the wager?
  Ham. Very well, my lord.
    Your Grace has laid the
 odds o' th' weaker side.
  King. I do not fear it, I have seen you both;
    But since he is bett
er'd, we have therefore odds.
  Laer. This is too heavy; let me see another.
  Ham. This likes me 
well. These foils have all a length?
                                                Prepare to pla
y.
  Osr. Ay, my good lord.
  King. Set me the stoups of wine upon that table.
    If Hamlet give
 the first or second hit,
    Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
    Let all the battlements
 their ordnance fire;
    The King shall drink to Hamlet's better breath,
    And in the cup an un
ion shall he throw
    Richer than that which four successive kings
    In Denmark's crown have wo
rn. Give me the cups;
    And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
    The trumpet to the cannonee
r without,
    The cannons to the heavens, the heaven to earth,
    'Now the King drinks to Hamlet
.' Come, begin.
    And you the judges, bear a wary eye.
  Ham. Come on, sir.
  Laer. Come, my lo
rd.                                They play.
  Ham. One.
  Laer. No.
  Ham. Judgment!
  Osr. A 
hit, a very palpable hit.
  Laer. Well, again!
  King. Stay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is 
thine;
    Here's to thy health.
               [Drum; trumpets sound; a piece goes off [within].

    Give him the cup.
  Ham. I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile.
    Come. (They play.) 
Another hit. What say you?
  Laer. A touch, a touch; I do confess't.
  King. Our son shall win.
 
 Queen. He's fat, and scant of breath.
    Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows.
    The Qu
een carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
  Ham. Good madam!
  King. Gertrude, do not drink.
  Queen. 
I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.          Drinks.
  King. [aside] It is the poison'd cup; it 
is too late.
  Ham. I dare not drink yet, madam; by-and-by.
  Queen. Come, let me wipe thy face.

  Laer. My lord, I'll hit him now.
  King. I do not think't.
  Laer. [aside] And yet it is almost 
against my conscience.
  Ham. Come for the third, Laertes! You but dally.
    Pray you pass with y
our best violence;
    I am afeard you make a wanton of me.
  Laer. Say you so? Come on.          
                     Play.
  Osr. Nothing neither way.
  Laer. Have at you now!
                [
Laertes wounds Hamlet; then] in scuffling, they
                    change rapiers, [and Hamlet wou
nds Laertes].
  King. Part them! They are incens'd.
  Ham. Nay come! again!                       
  The Queen falls.

  Osr. Look to the Queen there, ho!
  Hor. They bleed on both sides. How is i
t, my lord?
  Osr. How is't, Laertes?
  Laer. Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric.
    
I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.
  Ham. How does the Queen?
  King. She sounds to see t
hem bleed.
  Queen. No, no! the drink, the drink! O my dear Hamlet!
    The drink, the drink! I am
 poison'd.                 [Dies.]
  Ham. O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd.
    Treachery! Se
ek it out.
                                                [Laertes falls.]
  Laer. It is here, Ha
mlet. Hamlet, thou art slain;
    No medicine in the world can do thee good.
    In thee there is 
not half an hour of life.
    The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
    Unbated and envenom'd
. The foul practice
    Hath turn'd itself on me. Lo, here I lie,
    Never to rise again. Thy mot
her's poison'd.
    I can no more. The King, the King's to blame.
  Ham. The point envenom'd too?

    Then, venom, to thy work.                    Hurts the King.
  All. Treason! treason!
  King.
 O, yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt.
  Ham. Here, thou incestuous, murd'rous, damned Dane,
 
   Drink off this potion! Is thy union here?
    Follow my mother.                                 
King dies.
  Laer. He is justly serv'd.
    It is a poison temper'd by himself.
    Exchange forg
iveness with me, noble Hamlet.
    Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
    Nor thine on
 me!                                       Dies.
  Ham. Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.

    I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!
    You that look pale and tremble at this chance,

    That are but mutes or audience to this act,
    Had I but time (as this fell sergeant, Death,

    Is strict in his arrest) O, I could tell you-
    But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;
    Tho
u liv'st; report me and my cause aright
    To the unsatisfied.
  Hor. Never believe it.
    I am
 more an antique Roman than a Dane.
    Here's yet some liquor left.
  Ham. As th'art a man,
    
Give me the cup. Let go! By heaven, I'll ha't.
    O good Horatio, what a wounded name
    (Things
 standing thus unknown) shall live behind me!
    If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,
    Abs
ent thee from felicity awhile,
    And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
    To tell my
 story.         [March afar off, and shot within.]
    What warlike noise is this?
  Osr. Young Fo
rtinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
    To the ambassadors of England gives
    This warlike
 volley.
  Ham. O, I die, Horatio!
    The potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit.
    I cannot 
live to hear the news from England,
    But I do prophesy th' election lights
    On Fortinbras. H
e has my dying voice.
    So tell him, with th' occurrents, more and less,
    Which have solicite
d- the rest is silence.             Dies.
  Hor. Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince
,
    And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
                                               
  [March within.]
    Why does the drum come hither?

    Enter Fortinbras and English Ambassador
s, with Drum,
                  Colours, and Attendants.

  Fort. Where is this sight?
  Hor. Wh
at is it you will see?
    If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
  Fort. This quarry cries
 on havoc. O proud Death,
    What feast is toward in thine eternal cell
    That thou so many pri
nces at a shot
    So bloodily hast struck.
  Ambassador. The sight is dismal;
    And our affair
s from England come too late.
    The ears are senseless that should give us hearing
    To tell h
im his commandment is fulfill'd
    That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.
    Where should w
e have our thanks?
  Hor. Not from his mouth,
    Had it th' ability of life to thank you.
    He
 never gave commandment for their death.
    But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
    You
 from the Polack wars, and you from England,
    Are here arriv'd, give order that these bodies
  
  High on a stage be placed to the view;
    And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
    How t
hese things came about. So shall you hear
    Of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts;
    Of acciden
tal judgments, casual slaughters;
    Of deaths put on by cunning and forc'd cause;
    And, in th
is upshot, purposes mistook
    Fall'n on th' inventors' heads. All this can I
    Truly deliver.

  Fort. Let us haste to hear it,
    And call the noblest to the audience.
    For me, with sorro
w I embrace my fortune.
    I have some rights of memory in this kingdom
    Which now, to claim m
y vantage doth invite me.
  Hor. Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
    And from his mouth 
whose voice will draw on more.
    But let this same be presently perform'd,
    Even while men's 
minds are wild, lest more mischance
    On plots and errors happen.
  Fort. Let four captains
   
 Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage;
    For he was likely, had he been put on,
    To have p
rov'd most royally; and for his passage
    The soldiers' music and the rites of war
    Speak lou
dly for him.
    Take up the bodies. Such a sight as this
    Becomes the field but here shows muc
h amiss.
    Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
            Exeunt marching; after the which a peal of or
dnance
                                                   are shot off.

ACT I. Scene I.
Elsinore. A platform before the Castle.

Enter two 
Sentinels-[first,] Francisco, [who paces up and down
at his post; then] Bernardo, [who approaches h
im].

  Ber. Who's there?
  Fran. Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.
  Ber. Long live th
e King!
  Fran. Bernardo?
  Ber. He.
  Fran. You come most carefully upon your hour.
  Ber. 'Tis
 now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.
  Fran. For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter co
ld,
    And I am sick at heart.
  Ber. Have you had quiet guard?
  Fran. Not a mouse stirring.
 
 Ber. Well, good night.
    If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
    The rivals of my watch, bid 
them make haste.

                    Enter Horatio and Marcellus.

  Fran. I think I hear them.
 Stand, ho! Who is there?
  Hor. Friends to this ground.
  Mar. And liegemen to the Dane.
  Fran.
 Give you good night.
  Mar. O, farewell, honest soldier.
    Who hath reliev'd you?
  Fran. Bern
ardo hath my place.
    Give you good night.                                   Exit.
  Mar. Holla,
 Bernardo!
  Ber. Say-
    What, is Horatio there ?
  Hor. A piece of him.
  Ber. Welcome, Horat
io. Welcome, good Marcellus.
  Mar. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
  Ber. I have se
en nothing.
  Mar. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
    And will not let belief take hold of him

    Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.
    Therefore I have entreated him along,
   
 With us to watch the minutes of this night,
    That, if again this apparition come,
    He may a
pprove our eyes and speak to it.
  Hor. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
  Ber. Sit down awhile,
  
  And let us once again assail your ears,
    That are so fortified against our story,
    What we
 two nights have seen.
  Hor. Well, sit we down,
    And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
  Be
r. Last night of all,
    When yond same star that's westward from the pole
    Had made his cours
e t' illume that part of heaven
    Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
    The bell then be
ating one-

                        Enter Ghost.

  Mar. Peace! break thee off! Look where it co
mes again!
  Ber. In the same figure, like the King that's dead.
  Mar. Thou art a scholar; speak 
to it, Horatio.
  Ber. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.
  Hor. Most like. It harrows 
me with fear and wonder.
  Ber. It would be spoke to.
  Mar. Question it, Horatio.
  Hor. What ar
t thou that usurp'st this time of night
    Together with that fair and warlike form
    In which 
the majesty of buried Denmark
    Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!
  Mar. It is
 offended.
  Ber. See, it stalks away!
  Hor. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!
          
                                           Exit Ghost.
  Mar. 'Tis gone and will not answer.
  Ber
. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale.
    Is not this something more than fantasy?
    Wh
at think you on't?
  Hor. Before my God, I might not this believe
    Without the sensible and tru
e avouch
    Of mine own eyes.
  Mar. Is it not like the King?
  Hor. As thou art to thyself.
  
  Such was the very armour he had on
    When he th' ambitious Norway combated.
    So frown'd he 
once when, in an angry parle,
    He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
    'Tis strange.
  Ma
r. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
    With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.

  Hor. In what particular thought to work I know not;
    But, in the gross and scope of my opini
on,
    This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
  Mar. Good now, sit down, and tell me he t
hat knows,
    Why this same strict and most observant watch
    So nightly toils the subject of t
he land,
    And why such daily cast of brazen cannon
    And foreign mart for implements of war;

    Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
    Does not divide the Sunday from the week.

    What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
    Doth make the night joint-labourer with the 
day?
    Who is't that can inform me?
  Hor. That can I.
    At least, the whisper goes so. Our l
ast king,
    Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
    Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norw
ay,
    Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
    Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant 
Hamlet
    (For so this side of our known world esteem'd him)
    Did slay this Fortinbras; who, b
y a seal'd compact,
    Well ratified by law and heraldry,
    Did forfeit, with his life, all tho
se his lands
    Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror;
    Against the which a moiety compet
ent
    Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
    To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
    Had h
e been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant
    And carriage of the article design'd,
    His fell
 to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
    Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
    Hath in the ski
rts of Norway, here and there,
    Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
    For food and diet, 
to some enterprise
    That hath a stomach in't; which is no other,
    As it doth well appear unt
o our state,
    But to recover of us, by strong hand
    And terms compulsatory, those foresaid l
ands
    So by his father lost; and this, I take it,
    Is the main motive of our preparations,

    The source of this our watch, and the chief head
    Of this post-haste and romage in the land.

  Ber. I think it be no other but e'en so.
    Well may it sort that this portentous figure
    
Comes armed through our watch, so like the King
    That was and is the question of these wars.
  
Hor. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
    In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
    A l
ittle ere the mightiest Julius fell,
    The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead
    Did
 squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;
    As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood,
    
Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
    Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
    Was 
sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.
    And even the like precurse of fierce events,
    As harb
ingers preceding still the fates
    And prologue to the omen coming on,
    Have heaven and earth
 together demonstrated
    Unto our climature and countrymen.

                      Enter Ghost 
again.

    But soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again!
    I'll cross it, though it blast me.- S
tay illusion!
                                               Spreads his arms.
    If thou hast an
y sound, or use of voice,
    Speak to me.
    If there be any good thing to be done,
    That ma
y to thee do ease, and, race to me,
    Speak to me.
    If thou art privy to thy country's fate,

    Which happily foreknowing may avoid,
    O, speak!
    Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life

    Extorted treasure in the womb of earth
    (For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death
),
                                                 The cock crows.
    Speak of it! Stay, and spe
ak!- Stop it, Marcellus!
  Mar. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
  Hor. Do, if it will not s
tand.
  Ber. 'Tis here!
  Hor. 'Tis here!
  Mar. 'Tis gone!
                                    
                 Exit Ghost.
    We do it wrong, being so majestical,
    To offer it the show of 
violence;
    For it is as the air, invulnerable,
    And our vain blows malicious mockery.
  Ber
. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
  Hor. And then it started, like a guilty thing
    U
pon a fearful summons. I have heard
    The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
    Doth with h
is lofty and shrill-sounding throat
    Awake the god of day; and at his warning,
    Whether in s
ea or fire, in earth or air,
    Th' extravagant and erring spirit hies
    To his confine; and of
 the truth herein
    This present object made probation.
  Mar. It faded on the crowing of the co
ck.
    Some say that ever, 'gainst that season comes
    Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrate
d,
    The bird of dawning singeth all night long;
    And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abr
oad,
    The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,
    No fairy takes, nor witch hath powe
r to charm,
    So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
  Hor. So have I heard and do in part bel
ieve it.
    But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
    Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastwar
d hill.
    Break we our watch up; and by my advice
    Let us impart what we have seen to-night

    Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
    This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
    Do y
ou consent we shall acquaint him with it,
    As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
    Let's
 do't, I pray; and I this morning know
    Where we shall find him most conveniently.           Exe
unt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A room of state in the Castle.

Flourish. [Enter Claudius, King
 of Denmark, Gertrude the Queen,
Hamlet,
Polonius, Laertes and his sister Ophelia, [Voltemand, Cor
nelius,]
Lords Attendant.

  King. Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
    The memory 
be green, and that it us befitted
    To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom
    To be
 contracted in one brow of woe,
    Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
    That we with
 wisest sorrow think on him
    Together with remembrance of ourselves.
    Therefore our sometime
 sister, now our queen,
    Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,
    Have we, as 'twere w
ith a defeated joy,
    With an auspicious, and a dropping eye,
    With mirth in funeral, and wit
h dirge in marriage,
    In equal scale weighing delight and dole,
    Taken to wife; nor have we 
herein barr'd
    Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
    With this affair along. For all,
 our thanks.
    Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
    Holding a weak supposal of our 
worth,
    Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
    Our state to be disjoint and out of fr
ame,
    Colleagued with this dream of his advantage,
    He hath not fail'd to pester us with mes
sage
    Importing the surrender of those lands
    Lost by his father, with all bands of law,
  
  To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
    Now for ourself and for this time of meeting.

    Thus much the business is: we have here writ
    To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,
    Who
, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears
    Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress
    His furthe
r gait herein, in that the levies,
    The lists, and full proportions are all made
    Out of his
 subject; and we here dispatch
    You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,
    For bearers of thi
s greeting to old Norway,
    Giving to you no further personal power
    To business with the Kin
g, more than the scope
    Of these dilated articles allow.            [Gives a paper.]
    Farewe
ll, and let your haste commend your duty.
  Cor., Volt. In that, and all things, will we show our d
uty.
  King. We doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell.
                                 Exeunt Volte
mand and Cornelius.
    And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
    You told us of some suit. 
What is't, Laertes?
    You cannot speak of reason to the Dane
    And lose your voice. What would
st thou beg, Laertes,
    That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
    The head is not more nat
ive to the heart,
    The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
    Than is the throne of Denmark t
o thy father.
    What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
  Laer. My dread lord,
    Your leave and favo
ur to return to France;
    From whence though willingly I came to Denmark
    To show my duty in 
your coronation,
    Yet now I must confess, that duty done,
    My thoughts and wishes bend again
 toward France
    And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
  King. Have you your father's 
leave? What says Polonius?
  Pol. He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
    By laboursome 
petition, and at last
    Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent.
    I do beseech you give him le
ave to go.
  King. Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,
    And thy best graces spend it at
 thy will!
    But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son-
  Ham. [aside] A little more than kin, and l
ess than kind!
  King. How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
  Ham. Not so, my lord. I am t
oo much i' th' sun.
  Queen. Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
    And let thine eye look 
like a friend on Denmark.
    Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
    Seek for thy noble father i
n the dust.
    Thou know'st 'tis common. All that lives must die,
    Passing through nature to e
ternity.
  Ham. Ay, madam, it is common.
  Queen. If it be,
    Why seems it so particular with t
hee?
  Ham. Seems, madam, Nay, it is. I know not 'seems.'
    'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good m
other,
    Nor customary suits of solemn black,
    Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,
    N
o, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
    Nor the dejected havior of the visage,
    Together with
 all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
    'That can denote me truly. These indeed seem,
    For they
 are actions that a man might play;
    But I have that within which passeth show-
    These but t
he trappings and the suits of woe.
  King. 'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
    
To give these mourning duties to your father;
    But you must know, your father lost a father;
  
  That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
    In filial obligation for some term
    To
 do obsequious sorrow. But to persever
    In obstinate condolement is a course
    Of impious stu
bbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief;
    It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
    A heart unfortifi
ed, a mind impatient,
    An understanding simple and unschool'd;
    For what we know must be, an
d is as common
    As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
    Why should we in our peevish opposit
ion
    Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
    A fault against the dead, a fault to na
ture,
    To reason most absurd, whose common theme
    Is death of fathers, and who still hath cr
ied,
    From the first corse till he that died to-day,
    'This must be so.' We pray you throw t
o earth
    This unprevailing woe, and think of us
    As of a father; for let the world take note

    You are the most immediate to our throne,
    And with no less nobility of love
    Than tha
t which dearest father bears his son
    Do I impart toward you. For your intent
    In going back
 to school in Wittenberg,
    It is most retrograde to our desire;
    And we beseech you, bend yo
u to remain
    Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
    Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and o
ur son.
  Queen. Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.
    I pray thee stay with us, go not
 to Wittenberg.
  Ham. I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
  King. Why, 'tis a loving and a fa
ir reply.
    Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come.
    This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet

    Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,
    No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day

    But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
    And the King's rouse the heaven shall bruit 
again,
    Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.
                                Flourish. Exeunt
 all but Hamlet.
  Ham. O that this too too solid flesh would melt,
    Thaw, and resolve itself i
nto a dew!
    Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
    His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! 
God!
    How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
    Seem to me all the uses of this world!
    
Fie on't! ah, fie! 'Tis an unweeded garden
    That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature

    Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
    But two months dead! Nay, not so much, not
 two.
    So excellent a king, that was to this
    Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
 
   That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
    Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!

    Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him
    As if increase of appetite had grown
    By wh
at it fed on; and yet, within a month-
    Let me not think on't! Frailty, thy name is woman!-
   
 A little month, or ere those shoes were old
    With which she followed my poor father's body
   
 Like Niobe, all tears- why she, even she
    (O God! a beast that wants discourse of reason
    W
ould have mourn'd longer) married with my uncle;
    My father's brother, but no more like my fathe
r
    Than I to Hercules. Within a month,
    Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
    Had 
left the flushing in her galled eyes,
    She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
    With such
 dexterity to incestuous sheets!
    It is not, nor it cannot come to good.
    But break my heart
, for I must hold my tongue!

          Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo.

  Hor. Hail to 
your lordship!
  Ham. I am glad to see you well.
    Horatio!- or I do forget myself.
  Hor. The 
same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
  Ham. Sir, my good friend- I'll change that name with y
ou.
    And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?
    Marcellus?
  Mar. My good lord!
  Ham. I
 am very glad to see you.- [To Bernardo] Good even, sir.-

    But what, in faith, make you from W
ittenberg?
  Hor. A truant disposition, good my lord.
  Ham. I would not hear your enemy say so,

    Nor shall you do my ear that violence
    To make it truster of your own report
    Against yo
urself. I know you are no truant.
    But what is your affair in Elsinore?
    We'll teach you to 
drink deep ere you depart.
  Hor. My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
  Ham. I prithee d
o not mock me, fellow student.
    I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
  Hor. Indeed, my lo
rd, it followed hard upon.
  Ham. Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats
    Did coldly 
furnish forth the marriage tables.
    Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
    Or ever I had 
seen that day, Horatio!
    My father- methinks I see my father.
  Hor. O, where, my lord?
  Ham.
 In my mind's eye, Horatio.
  Hor. I saw him once. He was a goodly king.
  Ham. He was a man, take
 him for all in all.
    I shall not look upon his like again.
  Hor. My lord, I think I saw him y
esternight.
  Ham. Saw? who?
  Hor. My lord, the King your father.
  Ham. The King my father?
  
Hor. Season your admiration for a while
    With an attent ear, till I may deliver
    Upon the wi
tness of these gentlemen,
    This marvel to you.
  Ham. For God's love let me hear!
  Hor. Two n
ights together had these gentlemen
    (Marcellus and Bernardo) on their watch
    In the dead vas
t and middle of the night
    Been thus encount'red. A figure like your father,
    Armed at point
 exactly, cap-a-pe,
    Appears before them and with solemn march
    Goes slow and stately by the
m. Thrice he walk'd
    By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
    Within his truncheon's len
gth; whilst they distill'd
    Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
    Stand dumb and speak not 
to him. This to me
    In dreadful secrecy impart they did,
    And I with them the third night ke
pt the watch;
    Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
    Form of the thing, each word mad
e true and good,
    The apparition comes. I knew your father.
    These hands are not more like.

  Ham. But where was this?
  Mar. My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
  Ham. Did you not
 speak to it?
  Hor. My lord, I did;
    But answer made it none. Yet once methought
    It lifte
d up it head and did address
    Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
    But even then the m
orning cock crew loud,
    And at the sound it shrunk in haste away
    And vanish'd from our sigh
t.
  Ham. 'Tis very strange.
  Hor. As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
    And we did thi
nk it writ down in our duty
    To let you know of it.
  Ham. Indeed, indeed, sirs. But this troub
les me.
    Hold you the watch to-night?
  Both [Mar. and Ber.] We do, my lord.
  Ham. Arm'd, say
 you?
  Both. Arm'd, my lord.
  Ham. From top to toe?
  Both. My lord, from head to foot.
  Ham.
 Then saw you not his face?
  Hor. O, yes, my lord! He wore his beaver up.
  Ham. What, look'd he 
frowningly.
  Hor. A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
  Ham. Pale or red?
  Hor. Nay, ve
ry pale.
  Ham. And fix'd his eyes upon you?
  Hor. Most constantly.
  Ham. I would I had been th
ere.
  Hor. It would have much amaz'd you.
  Ham. Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
  Hor. Wh
ile one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
  Both. Longer, longer.
  Hor. Not when I saw't.

  Ham. His beard was grizzled- no?
  Hor. It was, as I have seen it in his life,
    A sable sil
ver'd.
  Ham. I will watch to-night.
    Perchance 'twill walk again.
  Hor. I warr'nt it will.

  Ham. If it assume my noble father's person,
    I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape

    And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
    If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
    
Let it be tenable in your silence still;
    And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
    Give it a
n understanding but no tongue.
    I will requite your loves. So, fare you well.
    Upon the plat
form, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
    I'll visit you.
  All. Our duty to your honour.
  Ham. Your l
oves, as mine to you. Farewell.
                                        Exeunt [all but Hamlet].
 
   My father's spirit- in arms? All is not well.
    I doubt some foul play. Would the night were c
ome!
    Till then sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,
    Though all the earth o'erwhelm th
em, to men's eyes.
Exit.




Scene III.
Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius.

Enter L
aertes and Ophelia.

  Laer. My necessaries are embark'd. Farewell.
    And, sister, as the winds
 give benefit
    And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
    But let me hear from you.
  Oph. Do 
you doubt that?
  Laer. For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,
    Hold it a fashion, and a t
oy in blood;
    A violet in the youth of primy nature,
    Forward, not permanent- sweet, not las
ting;
    The perfume and suppliance of a minute;
    No more.
  Oph. No more but so?
  Laer. Th
ink it no more.
    For nature crescent does not grow alone
    In thews and bulk; but as this tem
ple waxes,
    The inward service of the mind and soul
    Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you
 now,
    And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
    The virtue of his will; but you must fear,

    His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
    For he himself is subject to his birth.
 
   He may not, as unvalued persons do,
    Carve for himself, for on his choice depends
    The sa
fety and health of this whole state,
    And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd
    Unto t
he voice and yielding of that body
    Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
    I
t fits your wisdom so far to believe it
    As he in his particular act and place
    May give his
 saying deed; which is no further
    Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
    Then weigh w
hat loss your honour may sustain
    If with too credent ear you list his songs,
    Or lose your 
heart, or your chaste treasure open
    To his unmast'red importunity.
    Fear it, Ophelia, fear 
it, my dear sister,
    And keep you in the rear of your affection,
    Out of the shot and danger
 of desire.
    The chariest maid is prodigal enough
    If she unmask her beauty to the moon.
  
  Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes.
    The canker galls the infants of the spring
    
Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd,
    And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
    Contagi
ous blastments are most imminent.
    Be wary then; best safety lies in fear.
    Youth to itself 
rebels, though none else near.
  Oph. I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep
    As watchman 
to my heart. But, good my brother,
    Do not as some ungracious pastors do,
    Show me the steep
 and thorny way to heaven,
    Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
    Himself the primr
ose path of dalliance treads
    And recks not his own rede.
  Laer. O, fear me not!

          
             Enter Polonius.

    I stay too long. But here my father comes.
    A double blessin
g is a double grace;
    Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
  Pol. Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, ab
oard, for shame!
    The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
    And you are stay'd for. There
- my blessing with thee!
    And these few precepts in thy memory
    Look thou character. Give th
y thoughts no tongue,
    Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.
    Be thou familiar, but by no 
means vulgar:
    Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
    Grapple them unto thy sou
l with hoops of steel;
    But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
    Of each new-hatch'd, un
fledg'd comrade. Beware
    Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,
    Bear't that th' opposed ma
y beware of thee.
    Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice;
    Take each man's censure, bu
t reserve thy judgment.
    Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
    But not express'd in fancy;
 rich, not gaudy;
    For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
    And they in France of the best ra
nk and station
    Are most select and generous, chief in that.
    Neither a borrower nor a lende
r be;
    For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
    And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry
.
    This above all- to thine own self be true,
    And it must follow, as the night the day,
  
  Thou canst not then be false to any man.
    Farewell. My blessing season this in thee!
  Laer. 
Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
  Pol. The time invites you. Go, your servants tend.
  La
er. Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well
    What I have said to you.
  Oph. 'Tis in my memory loc
k'd,
    And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
  Laer. Farewell.                             
             Exit.
  Pol. What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?
  Oph. So please you, something
 touching the Lord Hamlet.
  Pol. Marry, well bethought!
    'Tis told me he hath very oft of late

    Given private time to you, and you yourself
    Have of your audience been most free and boun
teous.
    If it be so- as so 'tis put on me,
    And that in way of caution- I must tell you
   
 You do not understand yourself so clearly
    As it behooves my daughter and your honour.
    Wha
t is between you? Give me up the truth.
  Oph. He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
    Of 
his affection to me.
  Pol. Affection? Pooh! You speak like a green girl,
    Unsifted in such per
ilous circumstance.
    Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
  Oph. I do not know, my lor
d, what I should think,
  Pol. Marry, I will teach you! Think yourself a baby
    That you have ta
'en these tenders for true pay,
    Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,
    Or (n
ot to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
    Running it thus) you'll tender me a fool.
  Oph. My l
ord, he hath importun'd me with love
    In honourable fashion.
  Pol. Ay, fashion you may call it
. Go to, go to!
  Oph. And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
    With almost all the 
holy vows of heaven.
  Pol. Ay, springes to catch woodcocks! I do know,
    When the blood burns, 
how prodigal the soul
    Lends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter,
    Giving more light tha
n heat, extinct in both
    Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
    You must not take for fi
re. From this time
    Be something scanter of your maiden presence.
    Set your entreatments at 
a higher rate
    Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
    Believe so much in him, that he i
s young,
    And with a larger tether may he walk
    Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia,
   
 Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
    Not of that dye which their investments show,

    But mere implorators of unholy suits,
    Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
    The b
etter to beguile. This is for all:
    I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth
    Have 
you so slander any moment leisure
    As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
    Look to't
, I charge you. Come your ways.
  Oph. I shall obey, my lord.
                                    
                     Exeunt.




Scene IV.
Elsinore. The platform before the Castle.

Enter 
Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus.

  Ham. The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
  Hor. It is a n
ipping and an eager air.
  Ham. What hour now?
  Hor. I think it lacks of twelve.
  Mar. No, it i
s struck.
  Hor. Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws near the season
    Wherein the spirit held
 his wont to walk.
                   A flourish of trumpets, and two pieces go off.
    What does
 this mean, my lord?
  Ham. The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
    Keeps wassail, an
d the swagg'ring upspring reels,
    And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
    The kettl
edrum and trumpet thus bray out
    The triumph of his pledge.
  Hor. Is it a custom?
  Ham. Ay, 
marry, is't;
    But to my mind, though I am native here
    And to the manner born, it is a custo
m
    More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
    This heavy-headed revel east and west

    Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations;
    They clip us drunkards and with swinish phras
e
    Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
    From our achievements, though perform'd at height
,
    The pith and marrow of our attribute.
    So oft it chances in particular men
    That, for
 some vicious mole of nature in them,
    As in their birth,- wherein they are not guilty,
    Sin
ce nature cannot choose his origin,-
    By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
    Oft breaking do
wn the pales and forts of reason,
    Or by some habit that too much o'erleavens
    The form of p
lausive manners, that these men
    Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
    Being nature's l
ivery, or fortune's star,
    Their virtues else- be they as pure as grace,
    As infinite as man
 may undergo-
    Shall in the general censure take corruption
    From that particular fault. The
 dram of e'il
    Doth all the noble substance often dout To his own scandal.

                  
       Enter Ghost.

  Hor. Look, my lord, it comes!
  Ham. Angels and ministers of grace defend 
us!
    Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
    Bring with thee airs from heaven or blast
s from hell,
    Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
    Thou com'st in such a questionable shape

    That I will speak to thee. I'll call thee Hamlet,
    King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me?

    Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell
    Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,
    H
ave burst their cerements; why the sepulchre
    Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
    Hath op'
d his ponderous and marble jaws
    To cast thee up again. What may this mean
    That thou, dead 
corse, again in complete steel,
    Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
    Making night hideo
us, and we fools of nature
    So horridly to shake our disposition
    With thoughts beyond the r
eaches of our souls?
    Say, why is this? wherefore? What should we do?
                         
                  Ghost beckons Hamlet.
  Hor. It beckons you to go away with it,
    As if it som
e impartment did desire
    To you alone.
  Mar. Look with what courteous action
    It waves you
 to a more removed ground.
    But do not go with it!
  Hor. No, by no means!
  Ham. It will not 
speak. Then will I follow it.
  Hor. Do not, my lord!
  Ham. Why, what should be the fear?
    I 
do not set my life at a pin's fee;
    And for my soul, what can it do to that,
    Being a thing 
immortal as itself?
    It waves me forth again. I'll follow it.
  Hor. What if it tempt you towar
d the flood, my lord,
    Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
    That beetles o'er his base in
to the sea,
    And there assume some other, horrible form
    Which might deprive your sovereignt
y of reason
    And draw you into madness? Think of it.
    The very place puts toys of desperatio
n,
    Without more motive, into every brain
    That looks so many fadoms to the sea
    And hea
rs it roar beneath.
  Ham. It waves me still.
    Go on. I'll follow thee.
  Mar. You shall not g
o, my lord.
  Ham. Hold off your hands!
  Hor. Be rul'd. You shall not go.
  Ham. My fate cries o
ut
    And makes each petty artire in this body
    As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
        
                                        [Ghost beckons.]

    Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentle
men.
    By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!-
    I say, away!- Go on. I'll follow t
hee.
                                        Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet.
  Hor. He waxes desperate wi
th imagination.
  Mar. Let's follow. 'Tis not fit thus to obey him.
  Hor. Have after. To what iss
ue will this come?
  Mar. Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
  Hor. Heaven will direct i
t.
  Mar. Nay, let's follow him.
                                                         Exeunt.





Scene V.
Elsinore. The Castle. Another part of the fortifications.

Enter Ghost and Haml
et.

  Ham. Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak! I'll go no further.
  Ghost. Mark me.
  Ham. I wil
l.
  Ghost. My hour is almost come,
    When I to sulph'rous and tormenting flames
    Must rende
r up myself.
  Ham. Alas, poor ghost!
  Ghost. Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
    To w
hat I shall unfold.
  Ham. Speak. I am bound to hear.
  Ghost. So art thou to revenge, when thou s
halt hear.
  Ham. What?
  Ghost. I am thy father's spirit,
    Doom'd for a certain term to walk 
the night,
    And for the day confin'd to fast in fires,
    Till the foul crimes done in my days
 of nature
    Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid
    To tell the secrets of my priso
n house,
    I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
    Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy yo
ung blood,
    Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
    Thy knotted and combin
ed locks to part,
    And each particular hair to stand on end
    Like quills upon the fretful po
rcupine.
    But this eternal blazon must not be
    To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, li
st!
    If thou didst ever thy dear father love-
  Ham. O God!
  Ghost. Revenge his foul and most
 unnatural murther.
  Ham. Murther?
  Ghost. Murther most foul, as in the best it is;
    But thi
s most foul, strange, and unnatural.
  Ham. Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
    As
 meditation or the thoughts of love,
    May sweep to my revenge.
  Ghost. I find thee apt;
    A
nd duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
    That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
    Woul
dst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.
    'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
   
 A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark
    Is by a forged process of my death
    Rankly
 abus'd. But know, thou noble youth,
    The serpent that did sting thy father's life
    Now wear
s his crown.
  Ham. O my prophetic soul!
    My uncle?
  Ghost. Ay, that incestuous, that adulter
ate beast,
    With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts-
    O wicked wit and gifts, that
 have the power
    So to seduce!- won to his shameful lust
    The will of my most seeming-virtuo
us queen.
    O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there,
    From me, whose love was of that dignity

    That it went hand in hand even with the vow
    I made to her in marriage, and to decline
   
 Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
    To those of mine!
    But virtue, as it never wil
l be mov'd,
    Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
    So lust, though to a radiant an
gel link'd,
    Will sate itself in a celestial bed
    And prey on garbage.
    But soft! methin
ks I scent the morning air.
    Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
    My custom always 
of the afternoon,
    Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
    With juice of cursed hebona in a vi
al,
    And in the porches of my ears did pour
    The leperous distilment; whose effect
    Hold
s such an enmity with blood of man
    That swift as quicksilver it courses through
    The natura
l gates and alleys of the body,
    And with a sudden vigour it doth posset
    And curd, like eag
er droppings into milk,
    The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine;
    And a most instant t
etter bark'd about,
    Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust
    All my smooth body.
  
  Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
    Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd;
 
   Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
    Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd,
    No reckonin
g made, but sent to my account
    With all my imperfections on my head.
  Ham. O, horrible! O, ho
rrible! most horrible!
  Ghost. If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.
    Let not the royal be
d of Denmark be
    A couch for luxury and damned incest.
    But, howsoever thou pursuest this ac
t,
    Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
    Against thy mother aught. Leave her to he
aven,
    And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge
    To prick and sting her. Fare thee well a
t once.
    The glowworm shows the matin to be near
    And gins to pale his uneffectual fire.
  
  Adieu, adieu, adieu! Remember me.                      Exit.

  Ham. O all you host of heaven! O
 earth! What else?
    And shall I couple hell? Hold, hold, my heart!
    And you, my sinews, grow
 not instant old,
    But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?
    Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory
 holds a seat
    In this distracted globe. Remember thee?
    Yea, from the table of my memory
 
   I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
    All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past
 
   That youth and observation copied there,
    And thy commandment all alone shall live
    Withi
n the book and volume of my brain,
    Unmix'd with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!
    O most perni
cious woman!
    O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
    My tables! Meet it is I set it d
own
    That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
    At least I am sure it may be so in De
nmark.        [Writes.]
    So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word:
    It is 'Adieu, adieu! Rem
ember me.'
    I have sworn't.
  Hor. (within) My lord, my lord!

                   Enter Horat
io and Marcellus.

  Mar. Lord Hamlet!
  Hor. Heaven secure him!
  Ham. So be it!
  Mar. Illo, 
ho, ho, my lord!
  Ham. Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.
  Mar. How is't, my noble lord?
  H
or. What news, my lord?
  Mar. O, wonderful!
  Hor. Good my lord, tell it.
  Ham. No, you will re
veal it.
  Hor. Not I, my lord, by heaven!
  Mar. Nor I, my lord.
  Ham. How say you then? Would 
heart of man once think it?
    But you'll be secret?
  Both. Ay, by heaven, my lord.
  Ham. Ther
e's neer a villain dwelling in all Denmark
    But he's an arrant knave.
  Hor. There needs no gho
st, my lord, come from the grave
    To tell us this.
  Ham. Why, right! You are in the right!
  
  And so, without more circumstance at all,
    I hold it fit that we shake hands and part;
    Yo
u, as your business and desires shall point you,
    For every man hath business and desire,
    S
uch as it is; and for my own poor part,
    Look you, I'll go pray.
  Hor. These are but wild and 
whirling words, my lord.
  Ham. I am sorry they offend you, heartily;
    Yes, faith, heartily.
 
 Hor. There's no offence, my lord.
  Ham. Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
    And mu
ch offence too. Touching this vision here,
    It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.
    Fo
r your desire to know what is between us,
    O'ermaster't as you may. And now, good friends,
    
As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,
    Give me one poor request.
  Hor. What is't, my lor
d? We will.
  Ham. Never make known what you have seen to-night.
  Both. My lord, we will not.
  
Ham. Nay, but swear't.
  Hor. In faith,
    My lord, not I.
  Mar. Nor I, my lord- in faith.
  H
am. Upon my sword.
  Mar. We have sworn, my lord, already.
  Ham. Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.


                 Ghost cries under the stage.

  Ghost. Swear.
  Ham. Aha boy, say'st thou so? 
Art thou there, truepenny?
    Come on! You hear this fellow in the cellarage.
    Consent to swea
r.
  Hor. Propose the oath, my lord.
  Ham. Never to speak of this that you have seen.
    Swear 
by my sword.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
  Ham. Hic et ubique? Then we'll shift our ground.
    Com
e hither, gentlemen,
    And lay your hands again upon my sword.
    Never to speak of this that y
ou have heard:
    Swear by my sword.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear by his sword.
  Ham. Well said, ol
d mole! Canst work i' th' earth so fast?
    A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends."
  H
or. O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
  Ham. And therefore as a stranger give it welco
me.
    There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
    Than are dreamt of in your philoso
phy.
    But come!
    Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
    How strange or odd soe'er I
 bear myself
    (As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
    To put an antic disposition on),

    That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
    With arms encumb'red thus, or this head-sha
ke,
    Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
    As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an 
if we would,'
    Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'
    Or such ambiguous
 giving out, to note
    That you know aught of me- this is not to do,
    So grace and mercy at y
our most need help you,
    Swear.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
                                    
               [They swear.]
  Ham. Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! So, gentlemen,
    With all my l
ove I do commend me to you;
    And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
    May do t' express his love
 and friending to you,
    God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;
    And still your 
fingers on your lips, I pray.
    The time is out of joint. O cursed spite
    That ever I was bor
n to set it right!
    Nay, come, let's go together.
                                             
            Exeunt.

Act II. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius
.

Enter Polonius and Reynaldo.

  Pol. Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
  Rey. I
 will, my lord.
  Pol. You shall do marvell's wisely, good Reynaldo,
    Before You visit him, to 
make inquire
    Of his behaviour.
  Rey. My lord, I did intend it.
  Pol. Marry, well said, very
 well said. Look you, sir,
    Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
    And how, and who, 
what means, and where they keep,
    What company, at what expense; and finding
    By this encomp
assment and drift of question
    That they do know my son, come you more nearer
    Than your par
ticular demands will touch it.
    Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
    As thus
, 'I know his father and his friends,
    And in part him.' Do you mark this, Reynaldo?
  Rey. Ay,
 very well, my lord.
  Pol. 'And in part him, but,' you may say, 'not well.
    But if't be he I m
ean, he's very wild
    Addicted so and so'; and there put on him
    What forgeries you please; m
arry, none so rank
    As may dishonour him- take heed of that;
    But, sir, such wanton, wild, a
nd usual slips
    As are companions noted and most known
    To youth and liberty.
  Rey. As gam
ing, my lord.
  Pol. Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
    Drabbing. You may go so 
far.
  Rey. My lord, that would dishonour him.
  Pol. Faith, no, as you may season it in the charg
e.
    You must not put another scandal on him,
    That he is open to incontinency.
    That's n
ot my meaning. But breathe his faults so quaintly
    That they may seem the taints of liberty,
  
  The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
    A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
    Of general as
sault.
  Rey. But, my good lord-
  Pol. Wherefore should you do this?
  Rey. Ay, my lord,
    I 
would know that.
  Pol. Marry, sir, here's my drift,
    And I believe it is a fetch of warrant.

    You laying these slight sullies on my son
    As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' th' working,

    Mark you,
    Your party in converse, him you would sound,
    Having ever seen in the preno
minate crimes
    The youth you breathe of guilty, be assur'd
    He closes with you in this conse
quence:
    'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman'-
    According to the phrase or the add
ition
    Of man and country-
  Rey. Very good, my lord.
  Pol. And then, sir, does 'a this- 'a d
oes- What was I about to
say?
    By the mass, I was about to say something! Where did I leave?
 
 Rey. At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,' and
    gentleman.'
  Pol. At 'closes in 
the consequence'- Ay, marry!
    He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman.
    I saw him yesterday, o
r t'other day,
    Or then, or then, with such or such; and, as you say,
    There was 'a gaming; 
there o'ertook in's rouse;
    There falling out at tennis'; or perchance,
    'I saw him enter su
ch a house of sale,'
    Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
    See you now-
    Your bait of fal
sehood takes this carp of truth;
    And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
    With windlasses an
d with assays of bias,
    By indirections find directions out.
    So, by my former lecture and a
dvice,
    Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?
  Rey. My lord, I have.
  Pol. God b' wi'
 ye, fare ye well!
  Rey. Good my lord!                                    [Going.]
  Pol. Observe
 his inclination in yourself.
  Rey. I shall, my lord.
  Pol. And let him ply his music.
  Rey. W
ell, my lord.
  Pol. Farewell!
                                                  Exit Reynaldo.


                       Enter Ophelia.

    How now, Ophelia? What's the matter?
  Oph. O my lord
, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
  Pol. With what, i' th' name of God?
  Oph. My lord, as I w
as sewing in my closet,
    Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac'd,
    No hat upon his head, 
his stockings foul'd,
    Ungart'red, and down-gyved to his ankle;
    Pale as his shirt, his knee
s knocking each other,
    And with a look so piteous in purport
    As if he had been loosed out 
of hell
    To speak of horrors- he comes before me.
  Pol. Mad for thy love?
  Oph. My lord, I d
o not know,
    But truly I do fear it.
  Pol. What said he?
  Oph. He took me by the wrist and h
eld me hard;
    Then goes he to the length of all his arm,
    And, with his other hand thus o'er
 his brow,
    He falls to such perusal of my face
    As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so.
  
  At last, a little shaking of mine arm,
    And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
    He r
ais'd a sigh so piteous and profound
    As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
    And end his be
ing. That done, he lets me go,
    And with his head over his shoulder turn'd
    He seem'd to fin
d his way without his eyes,
    For out o' doors he went without their help
    And to the last be
nded their light on me.
  Pol. Come, go with me. I will go seek the King.
    This is the very ecs
tasy of love,
    Whose violent property fordoes itself
    And leads the will to desperate undert
akings
    As oft as any passion under heaven
    That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
    
What, have you given him any hard words of late?
  Oph. No, my good lord; but, as you did command,

    I did repel his letters and denied
    His access to me.
  Pol. That hath made him mad.
    
I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
    I had not quoted him. I fear'd he did but trifle

    And meant to wrack thee; but beshrew my jealousy!
    By heaven, it is as proper to our age
 
   To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
    As it is common for the younger sort
    To lack d
iscretion. Come, go we to the King.
    This must be known; which, being kept close, might move
  
  More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
    Come.
                                          
               Exeunt.

Scene II.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Flourish. [Enter King and Qu
een, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern,
cum aliis.

  King. Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
.
    Moreover that we much did long to see you,
    The need we have to use you did provoke
    
Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
    Of Hamlet's transformation. So I call it,
    Sith
 nor th' exterior nor the inward man
    Resembles that it was. What it should be,
    More than h
is father's death, that thus hath put him
    So much from th' understanding of himself,
    I can
not dream of. I entreat you both
    That, being of so young days brought up with him,
    And sin
ce so neighbour'd to his youth and haviour,
    That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
   
 Some little time; so by your companies
    To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather
    So much
 as from occasion you may glean,
    Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus
    That, open'
d, lies within our remedy.
  Queen. Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,
    And sure I am 
two men there are not living
    To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
    To show us so 
much gentry and good will
    As to expend your time with us awhile
    For the supply and profit 
of our hope,
    Your visitation shall receive such thanks
    As fits a king's remembrance.
  Ro
s. Both your Majesties
    Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
    Put your dread pleasu
res more into command
    Than to entreaty.
  Guil. But we both obey,
    And here give up oursel
ves, in the full bent,
    To lay our service freely at your feet,
    To be commanded.
  King. T
hanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
  Queen. Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz.

    And I beseech you instantly to visit
    My too much changed son.- Go, some of you,
    And br
ing these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
  Guil. Heavens make our presence and our practices
    Pleas
ant and helpful to him!
  Queen. Ay, amen!
                 Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, [
with some
                                                    Attendants].

                     
    Enter Polonius.

  Pol. Th' ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
    Are joyfully return'd.

  King. Thou still hast been the father of good news.
  Pol. Have I, my lord? Assure you, my good
 liege,
    I hold my duty as I hold my soul,
    Both to my God and to my gracious king;
    And
 I do think- or else this brain of mine
    Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
    As it hath u
s'd to do- that I have found
    The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
  King. O, speak of that! That
 do I long to hear.
  Pol. Give first admittance to th' ambassadors.
    My news shall be the frui
t to that great feast.
  King. Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
                      
                          [Exit Polonius.]
    He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found
    Th
e head and source of all your son's distemper.
  Queen. I doubt it is no other but the main,
    H
is father's death and our o'erhasty marriage.
  King. Well, we shall sift him.

              Ent
er Polonius, Voltemand, and Cornelius.

    Welcome, my good friends.
    Say, Voltemand, what fr
om our brother Norway?
  Volt. Most fair return of greetings and desires.
    Upon our first, he s
ent out to suppress
    His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
    To be a preparation 'gainst
 the Polack,
    But better look'd into, he truly found
    It was against your Highness; whereat 
griev'd,
    That so his sickness, age, and impotence
    Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arr
ests
    On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys,
    Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,

    Makes vow before his uncle never more
    To give th' assay of arms against your Majesty.
   
 Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
    Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee
    And 
his commission to employ those soldiers,
    So levied as before, against the Polack;
    With an 
entreaty, herein further shown,
                                                [Gives a paper.]
 
   That it might please you to give quiet pass
    Through your dominions for this enterprise,
   
 On such regards of safety and allowance
    As therein are set down.
  King. It likes us well;
 
   And at our more consider'd time we'll read,
    Answer, and think upon this business.
    Meant
ime we thank you for your well-took labour.
    Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together.
  
  Most welcome home!                       Exeunt Ambassadors.
  Pol. This business is well ended.

    My liege, and madam, to expostulate
    What majesty should be, what duty is,
    Why day is 
day, night is night, and time is time.
    Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time.
    The
refore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
    And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
  
  I will be brief. Your noble son is mad.
    Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,
    What
 is't but to be nothing else but mad?
    But let that go.
  Queen. More matter, with less art.
 
 Pol. Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
    That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
    
And pity 'tis 'tis true. A foolish figure!
    But farewell it, for I will use no art.
    Mad let
 us grant him then. And now remains
    That we find out the cause of this effect-
    Or rather s
ay, the cause of this defect,
    For this effect defective comes by cause.
    Thus it remains, a
nd the remainder thus.
    Perpend.
    I have a daughter (have while she is mine),
    Who in he
r duty and obedience, mark,
    Hath given me this. Now gather, and surmise.
                     
                        [Reads] the letter.
    'To the celestial, and my soul's idol, the most bea
utified
      Ophelia,'-

    That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is a vile
      
phrase.
    But you shall hear. Thus:
                                                        [Rea
ds.]
    'In her excellent white bosom, these, &c.'
  Queen. Came this from Hamlet to her?
  Pol.
 Good madam, stay awhile. I will be faithful.     [Reads.]


          'Doubt thou the stars are 
fire;
            Doubt that the sun doth move;
          Doubt truth to be a liar;
            B
ut never doubt I love.
      'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers; I have not art
to
    re
ckon my groans; but that I love thee best, O most best,
believe
    it. Adieu.
      'Thine everm
ore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to
him,

HAMLET.'

    This, in obedience, hath my 
daughter shown me;
    And more above, hath his solicitings,
    As they fell out by time, by mean
s, and place,
    All given to mine ear.
  King. But how hath she
    Receiv'd his love?
  Pol. 
What do you think of me?
  King. As of a man faithful and honourable.
  Pol. I would fain prove so
. But what might you think,
    When I had seen this hot love on the wing
    (As I perceiv'd it, 
I must tell you that,
    Before my daughter told me), what might you,
    Or my dear Majesty your
 queen here, think,
    If I had play'd the desk or table book,
    Or given my heart a winking, m
ute and dumb,
    Or look'd upon this love with idle sight?
    What might you think? No, I went r
ound to work
    And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
    'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of th
y star.
    This must not be.' And then I prescripts gave her,
    That she should lock herself fr
om his resort,
    Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
    Which done, she took the fruits of 
my advice,
    And he, repulsed, a short tale to make,
    Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,

    Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
    Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,

    Into the madness wherein now he raves,
    And all we mourn for.
  King. Do you think 'tis t
his?
  Queen. it may be, very like.
  Pol. Hath there been such a time- I would fain know that-
 
   That I have Positively said ''Tis so,'
    When it prov'd otherwise.?
  King. Not that I know.

  Pol. [points to his head and shoulder] Take this from this, if
this
      be otherwise.
    If
 circumstances lead me, I will find
    Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
    Within t
he centre.
  King. How may we try it further?
  Pol. You know sometimes he walks for hours togethe
r
    Here in the lobby.
  Queen. So he does indeed.
  Pol. At such a time I'll loose my daughter
 to him.
    Be you and I behind an arras then.
    Mark the encounter. If he love her not,
    A
nd he not from his reason fall'n thereon
    Let me be no assistant for a state,
    But keep a fa
rm and carters.
  King. We will try it.

                 Enter Hamlet, reading on a book.

  Q
ueen. But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
  Pol. Away, I do beseech you, both away

    I'll board him presently. O, give me leave.
                       Exeunt King and Queen, [wit
h Attendants].
    How does my good Lord Hamlet?
  Ham. Well, God-a-mercy.
  Pol. Do you know me,
 my lord?
  Ham. Excellent well. You are a fishmonger.
  Pol. Not I, my lord.
  Ham. Then I would
 you were so honest a man.
  Pol. Honest, my lord?
  Ham. Ay, sir. To be honest, as this world goe
s, is to be one
man
    pick'd out of ten thousand.
  Pol. That's very true, my lord.
  Ham. For
 if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god
    kissing carrion- Have you a daughter?
  P
ol. I have, my lord.
  Ham. Let her not walk i' th' sun. Conception is a blessing, but
not
    as
 your daughter may conceive. Friend, look to't.
  Pol. [aside] How say you by that? Still harping o
n my daughter.
Yet
    he knew me not at first. He said I was a fishmonger. He is
far
    gone, 
far gone! And truly in my youth I suff'red much
extremity
    for love- very near this. I'll speak
 to him again.- What do
you
    read, my lord?
  Ham. Words, words, words.
  Pol. What is the ma
tter, my lord?
  Ham. Between who?
  Pol. I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
  Ham. Sland
ers, sir; for the satirical rogue says here that old
men
    have grey beards; that their faces ar
e wrinkled; their eyes
    purging thick amber and plum-tree gum; and that they have a
    plentif
ul lack of wit, together with most weak hams. All
which,
    sir, though I most powerfully and pot
ently believe, yet I
hold it
    not honesty to have it thus set down; for you yourself, sir,
   
 should be old as I am if, like a crab, you could go backward.

  Pol. [aside] Though this be madn
ess, yet there is a method
in't.-
   Will You walk out of the air, my lord?
  Ham. Into my grave?

  Pol. Indeed, that is out o' th' air. [Aside] How pregnant
sometimes
    his replies are! a hap
piness that often madness hits on,
which
    reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delive
red of.
I
    will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting
between
    him and my d
aughter.- My honourable lord, I will most humbly
take
    my leave of you.
  Ham. You cannot, sir
, take from me anything that I will more
    willingly part withal- except my life, except my life,
 except
my
    life,

                    Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Pol. Fare you
 well, my lord.
  Ham. These tedious old fools!
  Pol. You go to seek the Lord Hamlet. There he is
.
  Ros. [to Polonius] God save you, sir!
                                                Exit [Po
lonius].

  Guil. My honour'd lord!
  Ros. My most dear lord!
  Ham. My excellent good friends! 
How dost thou, Guildenstern?
Ah,
    Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
  Ros. As the indiff
erent children of the earth.
  Guil. Happy in that we are not over-happy.
    On Fortune's cap we 
are not the very button.
  Ham. Nor the soles of her shoe?
  Ros. Neither, my lord.
  Ham. Then y
ou live about her waist, or in the middle of her
    favours?
  Guil. Faith, her privates we.
  H
am. In the secret parts of Fortune? O! most true! she is a
    strumpet. What news ?
  Ros. None, 
my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
  Ham. Then is doomsday near! But your news is not true
. Let me
    question more in particular. What have you, my good friends,
    deserved at the hand
s of Fortune that she sends you to prison
    hither?
  Guil. Prison, my lord?
  Ham. Denmark's a
 prison.
  Ros. Then is the world one.
  Ham. A goodly one; in which there are many confines, ward
s, and
    dungeons, Denmark being one o' th' worst.
  Ros. We think not so, my lord.
  Ham. Why,
 then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either
good
    or bad but thinking makes it so. To m
e it is a prison.
  Ros. Why, then your ambition makes it one. 'Tis too narrow for
your
    mind.

  Ham. O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a
    king of infinite space, wer
e it not that I have bad dreams.
  Guil. Which dreams indeed are ambition; for the very substance

of
    the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
  Ham. A dream itself is but a shadow.
  Ro
s. Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality
that
    it is but a shadow's shadow.

  Ham. Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and
outstretch'd
    heroes the beggars' sh
adows. Shall we to th' court? for, by
my
    fay, I cannot reason.
  Both. We'll wait upon you.

  Ham. No such matter! I will not sort you with the rest of my
    servants; for, to speak to you l
ike an honest man, I am most
    dreadfully attended. But in the beaten way of friendship,
what
 
   make you at Elsinore?
  Ros. To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
  Ham. Beggar that I am,
 I am even poor in thanks; but I thank
you;
    and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a h
alfpenny.
Were
    you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free
    visitation? Come,
 deal justly with me. Come, come! Nay,
speak.
  Guil. What should we say, my lord?
  Ham. Why, an
ything- but to th' purpose. You were sent for; and
    there is a kind of confession in your looks,
 which your
modesties
    have not craft enough to colour. I know the good King and
Queen
    ha
ve sent for you.
  Ros. To what end, my lord?
  Ham. That you must teach me. But let me conjure yo
u by the
rights
    of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the
    obligation of o
ur ever-preserved love, and by what more dear
a
    better proposer could charge you withal, be ev
en and direct
with
    me, whether you were sent for or no.
  Ros. [aside to Guildenstern] What s
ay you?
  Ham. [aside] Nay then, I have an eye of you.- If you love me,
hold
    not off.
  Guil
. My lord, we were sent for.
  Ham. I will tell you why. So shall my anticipation prevent your
   
 discovery, and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no
    feather. I have of late- but wheref
ore I know not- lost all
my
    mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes
so
 
   heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the
earth,
    seems to me a sterile promon
tory; this most excellent canopy,
the
    air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this
m
ajestical
    roof fretted with golden fire- why, it appeareth no other
thing
    to me than a fo
ul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What
a
    piece of work is a man! how noble in reason! 
how infinite in
    faculties! in form and moving how express and admirable! in
    action how lik
e an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the
    beauty of the world, the paragon of animals! An
d yet to me
what
    is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me- no, nor
woman
    neithe
r, though by your smiling you seem to say so.
  Ros. My lord, there was no such stuff in my thought
s.
  Ham. Why did you laugh then, when I said 'Man delights not me'?
  Ros. To think, my lord, if 
you delight not in man, what lenten
    entertainment the players shall receive from you. We coted

them
    on the way, and hither are they coming to offer you service.
  Ham. He that plays the ki
ng shall be welcome- his Majesty shall
    have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his
 foil
and
    target; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humorous man
shall
    end his part i
n peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose
    lungs are tickle o' th' sere; and the lady shal
l say her mind
    freely, or the blank verse shall halt for't. What players are
    they?
  Ros.
 Even those you were wont to take such delight in, the
    tragedians of the city.
  Ham. How chan
ces it they travel? Their residence, both in
    reputation and profit, was better both ways.
  Ro
s. I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late
    innovation.
  Ham. Do they hold the
 same estimation they did when I was in
the
    city? Are they so follow'd?
  Ros. No indeed are 
they not.
  Ham. How comes it? Do they grow rusty?
  Ros. Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted
 pace; but there
is,
    sir, an eyrie of children, little eyases, that cry out on the
top
    o
f question and are most tyrannically clapp'd for't. These
are now
    the fashion, and so berattle
 the common stages (so they call
    them) that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goosequills and

    dare scarce come thither.
  Ham. What, are they children? Who maintains 'em? How are they
   
 escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can
    sing? Will they not say afterwar
ds, if they should grow
    themselves to common players (as it is most like, if their
means
    
are no better), their writers do them wrong to make them
exclaim
    against their own succession.

  Ros. Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the
nation
    holds it no sin to tar
re them to controversy. There was, for
a
    while, no money bid for argument unless the poet and 
the
player
    went to cuffs in the question.
  Ham. Is't possible?
  Guil. O, there has been mu
ch throwing about of brains.
  Ham. Do the boys carry it away?
  Ros. Ay, that they do, my lord- H
ercules and his load too.
  Ham. It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark,
and
   
 those that would make mows at him while my father lived give
    twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred d
ucats apiece for his picture
in
    little. 'Sblood, there is something in this more than
natural
, if
    philosophy could find it out.

                     Flourish for the Players.

  Guil.
 There are the players.
  Ham. Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come!
Th'
    
appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me
comply
    with you in this garb, lest my 
extent to the players (which I
    tell you must show fairly outwards) should more appear like
   
 entertainment than yours. You are welcome. But my
uncle-father
    and aunt-mother are deceiv'd.

  Guil. In what, my dear lord?
  Ham. I am but mad north-north-west. When the wind is southerly
I

    know a hawk from a handsaw.

                            Enter Polonius.

  Pol. Well be w
ith you, gentlemen!
  Ham. Hark you, Guildenstern- and you too- at each ear a hearer!
    That gre
at baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling
    clouts.
  Ros. Happily he's the second t
ime come to them; for they say an
old
    man is twice a child.
  Ham. I will prophesy he comes t
o tell me of the players. Mark
it.-
   You say right, sir; a Monday morning; twas so indeed.
  Po
l. My lord, I have news to tell you.
  Ham. My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an

actor in
    Rome-
  Pol. The actors are come hither, my lord.
  Ham. Buzz, buzz!
  Pol. Upon my
 honour-
  Ham. Then came each actor on his ass-
  Pol. The best actors in the world, either for t
ragedy, comedy,
    history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral,
    tragical-histori
cal, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral;
scene
    individable, or poem unlimited. Seneca cannot
 be too heavy,
nor
    Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these
are
    the
 only men.
  Ham. O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
  Pol. What treasure ha
d he, my lord?
  Ham. Why,

         'One fair daughter, and no more,
           The which he lo
ved passing well.'

  Pol. [aside] Still on my daughter.
  Ham. Am I not i' th' right, old Jephth
ah?
  Pol. If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I
    love passing well.
  Ha
m. Nay, that follows not.
  Pol. What follows then, my lord?
  Ham. Why,

           'As by lot,
 God wot,'

 and then, you know,

           'It came to pass, as most like it was.'

    The 
first row of the pious chanson will show you more; for
look
    where my abridgment comes.

    
                 Enter four or five Players.

    You are welcome, masters; welcome, all.- I am gl
ad to see
thee
    well.- Welcome, good friends.- O, my old friend? Why, thy
face is
    valanc'
d since I saw thee last. Com'st' thou to' beard me in
    Denmark?- What, my young lady and mistres
s? By'r Lady, your
    ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last by the
    altitude o
f a chopine. Pray God your voice, like a piece of
    uncurrent gold, be not crack'd within the rin
g.- Masters, you
are
    all welcome. We'll e'en to't like French falconers, fly at
    anything 
we see. We'll have a speech straight. Come, give us
a
    taste of your quality. Come, a passionat
e speech.
  1. Play. What speech, my good lord?
  Ham. I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it
 was never
acted;
    or if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember,
pleas'd
    not th
e million, 'twas caviary to the general; but it was (as
I
    receiv'd it, and others, whose judgm
ents in such matters
cried in
    the top of mine) an excellent play, well digested in the
scenes
,
    set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember one said
    there were no sallets in t
he lines to make the matter
savoury,
    nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author 
of
    affectation; but call'd it an honest method, as wholesome as
    sweet, and by very much mo
re handsome than fine. One speech
in't
    I chiefly lov'd. 'Twas AEneas' tale to Dido, and therea
bout
of it
    especially where he speaks of Priam's slaughter. If it live
in
    your memory, b
egin at this line- let me see, let me see:

         'The rugged Pyrrhus, like th' Hyrcanian beast
-'

    'Tis not so; it begins with Pyrrhus:

         'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,

         Black as his purpose, did the night resemble
         When he lay couched in the ominous
 horse,
         Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd
         With heraldry more dism
al. Head to foot
         Now is be total gules, horridly trick'd
         With blood of fathers, 
mothers, daughters, sons,
         Bak'd and impasted with the parching streets,
         That len
d a tyrannous and a damned light
         To their lord's murther. Roasted in wrath and fire,
    
     And thus o'ersized with coagulate gore,
         With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhu
s
         Old grandsire Priam seeks.'

    So, proceed you.
  Pol. Fore God, my lord, well spok
en, with good accent and good
     discretion.

  1. Play. 'Anon he finds him,
      Striking to
o short at Greeks. His antique sword,
      Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
      Repu
gnant to command. Unequal match'd,
      Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide;
      But 
with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
      Th' unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
 
     Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
      Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash

      Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear. For lo! his sword,
      Which was declining on the milky head

      Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' th' air to stick.
      So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood
,
      And, like a neutral to his will and matter,
      Did nothing.
      But, as we often see
, against some storm,
      A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
      The bold winds s
peechless, and the orb below
      As hush as death- anon the dreadful thunder
      Doth rend the
 region; so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
      Aroused vengeance sets him new awork;
      And never did
 the Cyclops' hammers fall
      On Mars's armour, forg'd for proof eterne,
      With less remors
e than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
      Now falls on Priam.
      Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune! Al
l you gods,
      In general synod take away her power;
      Break all the spokes and fellies fro
m her wheel,
      And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
      As low as to the fiends!


  Pol. This is too long.
  Ham. It shall to the barber's, with your beard.- Prithee say
on.
 
   He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps. Say on;
come to
    Hecuba.

  1. Play. 'Bu
t who, O who, had seen the mobled queen-'

  Ham. 'The mobled queen'?
  Pol. That's good! 'Mobled
 queen' is good.

  1. Play. 'Run barefoot up and down, threat'ning the flames
      With bisson 
rheum; a clout upon that head
      Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
      About her l
ank and all o'erteemed loins,
      A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up-
      Who this had 
seen, with tongue in venom steep'd
      'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have pronounc'd.
  
    But if the gods themselves did see her then,
      When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
 
     In Mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,
      The instant burst of clamour that she mad
e
      (Unless things mortal move them not at all)
      Would have made milch the burning eyes o
f heaven
      And passion in the gods.'

  Pol. Look, whe'r he has not turn'd his colour, and ha
s tears
in's
    eyes. Prithee no more!
  Ham. 'Tis well. I'll have thee speak out the rest of th
is
soon.-
    Good my lord, will you see the players well bestow'd? Do you
    hear? Let them be 
well us'd; for they are the abstract and
brief
    chronicles of the time. After your death you we
re better have
a
    bad epitaph than their ill report while you live.
  Pol. My lord, I will use
 them according to their desert.
  Ham. God's bodykins, man, much better! Use every man after his

    desert, and who should scape whipping? Use them after your
own
    honour and dignity. The les
s they deserve, the more merit is
in
    your bounty. Take them in.
  Pol. Come, sirs.
  Ham. Fo
llow him, friends. We'll hear a play to-morrow.
                 Exeunt Polonius and Players [excep
t the First].
    Dost thou hear me, old friend? Can you play 'The Murther of
    Gonzago'?
  1. 
Play. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need, study a
    speech of
 some dozen or sixteen lines which I would set down
and
    insert in't, could you not?
  1. Play
. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Very well. Follow that lord- and look you mock him not.
                    
                        [Exit First Player.]
    My good friends, I'll leave you till night. You ar
e welcome
to
    Elsinore.
  Ros. Good my lord!
  Ham. Ay, so, God b' wi' ye!
                 
           [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
    Now I am alone.
    O what a rogue and peasant
 slave am I!
    Is it not monstrous that this player here,
    But in a fiction, in a dream of pa
ssion,
    Could force his soul so to his own conceit
    That, from her working, all his visage w
ann'd,
    Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
    A broken voice, and his whole function 
suiting
    With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!
    For Hecuba!
    What's Hecuba to 
him, or he to Hecuba,
    That he should weep for her? What would he do,
    Had he the motive and
 the cue for passion
    That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
    And cleave the gener
al ear with horrid speech;
    Make mad the guilty and appal the free,
    Confound the ignorant, 
and amaze indeed
    The very faculties of eyes and ears.
    Yet I,
    A dull and muddy-mettled
 rascal, peak
    Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
    And can say nothing! No, not for
 a king,
    Upon whose property and most dear life
    A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?

    Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
    Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?

    Tweaks me by th' nose? gives me the lie i' th' throat
    As deep as to the lungs? Who does me 
this, ha?
    'Swounds, I should take it! for it cannot be
    But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack ga

    I should have fatted all the region kites

    Must (like a whore) unpac
k my heart with words
    And fall a-cursing like a very drab,

    Fie upon't! fo

    That guilty creatures, sitting at a play,
    Have by th
e very cunning of the scene
    Been struck so to the soul that presently
    They have proclaim'd
 their malefactions;
    For murther, though it have no tongue, will speak
    With most miraculou

    Before mine 
uncle. I'll observe his looks;
    I'll tent him to the quick. If he but blench,
    I know my cou
rse. The spirit that I have seen
    May be a devil; and the devil hath power
    T' assume a plea
sing shape; yea, and perhaps
    Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
    As he is very potent wi
th such spirits,
    Abuses me to damn me. I'll have grounds
    More relative than this. The play
's the thing
    Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King.         Exit.

ACT III. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencra
ntz, Guildenstern,
and Lords.

  King. And can you by no drift of circumstance
    Get from him 
why he puts on this confusion,
    Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
    With turbulent and
 dangerous lunacy?
  Ros. He does confess he feels himself distracted,
    But from what cause he 
will by no means speak.
  Guil. Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
    But with a crafty ma
dness keeps aloof
    When we would bring him on to some confession
    Of his true state.
  Quee
n. Did he receive you well?
  Ros. Most like a gentleman.
  Guil. But with much forcing of his dis
position.
  Ros. Niggard of question, but of our demands
    Most free in his reply.
  Queen. Did
 you assay him
    To any pastime?
  Ros. Madam, it so fell out that certain players
    We o'err
aught on the way. Of these we told him,
    And there did seem in him a kind of joy
    To hear of
 it. They are here about the court,
    And, as I think, they have already order
    This night to
 play before him.
  Pol. 'Tis most true;
    And he beseech'd me to entreat your Majesties
    To
 hear and see the matter.
  King. With all my heart, and it doth much content me
    To hear him s
o inclin'd.
    Good gentlemen, give him a further edge
    And drive his purpose on to these deli
ghts.
  Ros. We shall, my lord.
                            Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  King. Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
    For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
    That he,
 as 'twere by accident, may here
    Affront Ophelia.
    Her father and myself (lawful espials)

    Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing unseen,
    We may of their encounter frankly judge
    
And gather by him, as he is behav'd,
    If't be th' affliction of his love, or no,
    That thus 
he suffers for.
  Queen. I shall obey you;
    And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
    That you
r good beauties be the happy cause
    Of Hamlet's wildness. So shall I hope your virtues
    Will
 bring him to his wonted way again,
    To both your honours.
  Oph. Madam, I wish it may.
      
                                             [Exit Queen.]
  Pol. Ophelia, walk you here.- Gracious
, so please you,
    We will bestow ourselves.- [To Ophelia] Read on this book,
    That show of s
uch an exercise may colour
    Your loneliness.- We are oft to blame in this,
    'Tis too much pr
ov'd, that with devotion's visage
    And pious action we do sugar o'er
    The Devil himself.
  
King. [aside] O, 'tis too true!
    How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
    The 
harlot's cheek, beautied with plast'ring art,
    Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
    
Than is my deed to my most painted word.
    O heavy burthen!
  Pol. I hear him coming. Let's with
draw, my lord.
                                      Exeunt King and Polonius].

                
           Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. To be, or not to be- that is the question:
    Whether 'tis nobl
er in the mind to suffer
    The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
    Or to take arms again
st a sea of troubles,
    And by opposing end them. To die- to sleep-
    No more; and by a sleep 
to say we end
    The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks
    That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a
 consummation
    Devoutly to be wish'd. To die- to sleep.
    To sleep- perchance to dream: ay, t
here's the rub!
    For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
    When we have shuffled off 
this mortal coil,
    Must give us pause. There's the respect
    That makes calamity of so long l
ife.
    For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
    Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man
's contumely,
    The pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay,
    The insolence of office, and th
e spurns
    That patient merit of th' unworthy takes,
    When he himself might his quietus make

    With a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear,
    To grunt and sweat under a weary life,

    But that the dread of something after death-
    The undiscover'd country, from whose bourn
  
  No traveller returns- puzzles the will,
    And makes us rather bear those ills we have
    Than
 fly to others that we know not of?
    Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
    And thus 
the native hue of resolution
    Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
    And enterpris
es of great pith and moment
    With this regard their currents turn awry
    And lose the name of
 action.- Soft you now!
    The fair Ophelia!- Nymph, in thy orisons
    Be all my sins rememb'red
.
  Oph. Good my lord,
    How does your honour for this many a day?
  Ham. I humbly thank you; w
ell, well, well.
  Oph. My lord, I have remembrances of yours
    That I have longed long to re-de
liver.
    I pray you, now receive them.
  Ham. No, not I!
    I never gave you aught.
  Oph. My
 honour'd lord, you know right well you did,
    And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd
 
   As made the things more rich. Their perfume lost,
    Take these again; for to the noble mind
 
   Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
    There, my lord.
  Ham. Ha, ha! Are you honest
?
  Oph. My lord?
  Ham. Are you fair?
  Oph. What means your lordship?
  Ham. That if you be ho
nest and fair, your honesty should admit
no
    discourse to your beauty.
  Oph. Could beauty, my
 lord, have better commerce than with
honesty?
  Ham. Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will soon
er transform
    honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty
can
    translate be
auty into his likeness. This was sometime a
paradox,
    but now the time gives it proof. I did lo
ve you once.
  Oph. Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
  Ham. You should not have believ'd m
e; for virtue cannot so
    inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it. I loved
you
    no
t.
  Oph. I was the more deceived.
  Ham. Get thee to a nunnery! Why wouldst thou be a breeder of

    sinners? I am myself indifferent honest, but yet I could
accuse
    me of such things that it
 were better my mother had not borne
me.
    I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more off
ences at
my
    beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give
    them shape, or 
time to act them in. What should such fellows
as I
    do, crawling between earth and heaven? We a
re arrant knaves
all;
    believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where's your
    father?

  Oph. At home, my lord.
  Ham. Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool
    now
here but in's own house. Farewell.
  Oph. O, help him, you sweet heavens!
  Ham. If thou dost marr
y, I'll give thee this plague for thy
dowry:
    be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou s
halt not
escape
    calumny. Get thee to a nunnery. Go, farewell. Or if thou wilt
    needs marry
, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what
    monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go;
 and quickly too.
    Farewell.
  Oph. O heavenly powers, restore him!
  Ham. I have heard of you
r paintings too, well enough. God hath
    given you one face, and you make yourselves another. You
 jig,
you
    amble, and you lisp; you nickname God's creatures and make
your
    wantonness you
r ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't! it hath
made
    me mad. I say, we will have no more marria
ges. Those that are
    married already- all but one- shall live; the rest shall keep
as
    they
 are. To a nunnery, go.                            Exit.
  Oph. O, what a noble mind is here o'erth
rown!
    The courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword,
    Th' expectancy and rose of
 the fair state,
    The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
    Th' observ'd of all observers
- quite, quite down!
    And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
    That suck'd the honey of h
is music vows,
    Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
    Like sweet bells jangled, out
 of tune and harsh;
    That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
    Blasted with ecstasy. O
, woe is me
    T' have seen what I have seen, see what I see!

                   Enter King and
 Polonius.

  King. Love? his affections do not that way tend;
    Nor what he spake, though it l
ack'd form a little,
    Was not like madness. There's something in his soul
    O'er which his me
lancholy sits on brood;
    And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
    Will be some danger; whi
ch for to prevent,
    I have in quick determination
    Thus set it down: he shall with speed to 
England
    For the demand of our neglected tribute.
    Haply the seas, and countries different,

    With variable objects, shall expel
    This something-settled matter in his heart,
    Whereo
n his brains still beating puts him thus
    From fashion of himself. What think you on't?
  Pol. 
It shall do well. But yet do I believe
    The origin and commencement of his grief
    Sprung fro
m neglected love.- How now, Ophelia?
    You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said.
    We heard 
it all.- My lord, do as you please;
    But if you hold it fit, after the play
    Let his queen m
other all alone entreat him
    To show his grief. Let her be round with him;
    And I'll be plac
'd so please you, in the ear
    Of all their conference. If she find him not,
    To England send
 him; or confine him where
    Your wisdom best shall think.
  King. It shall be so.
    Madness 
in great ones must not unwatch'd go.         Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. hall in the Castl
e.

Enter Hamlet and three of the Players.

  Ham. Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounc'd
 it to you,
    trippingly on the tongue. But if you mouth it, as many of our
    players do, I ha
d as live the town crier spoke my lines. Nor
do
    not saw the air too much with your hand, thus,
 but use all
    gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and (as I may say)
    whirlwind of you
r passion, you must acquire and beget a
    temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends m
e to
the
    soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion
to
    tatters, to ve
ry rags, to split the cars of the groundlings,
who
    (for the most part) are capable of nothing 
but inexplicable
dumb
    shows and noise. I would have such a fellow whipp'd for
o'erdoing
    
Termagant. It out-herods Herod. Pray you avoid it.
  Player. I warrant your honour.
  Ham. Be not 
too tame neither; but let your own discretion be
your
    tutor. Suit the action to the word, the 
word to the action;
with
    this special observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of
    na
ture: for anything so overdone is from the purpose of
playing,
    whose end, both at the first an
d now, was and is, to hold, as
    'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show Virtue her own
feature
,
    scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time
his
    form and pressure. Now t
his overdone, or come tardy off,
though
    it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judic
ious
    grieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance
    o'erweigh a whole theatre
 of others. O, there be players that
I
    have seen play, and heard others praise, and that highl
y (not
to
    speak it profanely), that, neither having the accent of
    Christians, nor the gai
t of Christian, pagan, nor man, have
so
    strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of Natu
re's
    journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they
imitated
    humanity so abominabl
y.
  Player. I hope we have reform'd that indifferently with us,
sir.
  Ham. O, reform it altoget
her! And let those that play your
clowns
    speak no more than is set down for them. For there be
 of them
    that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren
    spectators to laugh
 too, though in the mean time some
necessary
    question of the play be then to be considered. Th
at's
villanous
    and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it.
Go
    make you r
eady.
                                                 Exeunt Players.

            Enter Poloniu
s, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.

    How now, my lord? Will the King hear this piece of work?
 
 Pol. And the Queen too, and that presently.
  Ham. Bid the players make haste, [Exit Polonius.] Wi
ll you two
    help to hasten them?
  Both. We will, my lord.                       Exeunt they tw
o.
  Ham. What, ho, Horatio!

                      Enter Horatio.

  Hor. Here, sweet lord, at
 your service.
  Ham. Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
    As e'er my conversation cop'd witha
l.
  Hor. O, my dear lord!
  Ham. Nay, do not think I flatter;
    For what advancement may I hop
e from thee,
    That no revenue hast but thy good spirits
    To feed and clothe thee? Why should
 the poor be flatter'd?
    No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
    And crook the pregnan
t hinges of the knee
    Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
    Since my dear soul w
as mistress of her choice
    And could of men distinguish, her election
    Hath seal'd thee for 
herself. For thou hast been
    As one, in suff'ring all, that suffers nothing;
    A man that For
tune's buffets and rewards
    Hast ta'en with equal thanks; and blest are those
    Whose blood a
nd judgment are so well commingled
    That they are not a pipe for Fortune's finger
    To sound 
what stop she please. Give me that man
    That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
    In
 my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
    As I do thee. Something too much of this I
    The
re is a play to-night before the King.
    One scene of it comes near the circumstance,
    Which 
I have told thee, of my father's death.
    I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
    Even wi
th the very comment of thy soul
    Observe my uncle. If his occulted guilt
    Do not itself unke
nnel in one speech,
    It is a damned ghost that we have seen,
    And my imaginations are as fou
l
    As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
    For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,
    
And after we will both our judgments join
    In censure of his seeming.
  Hor. Well, my lord.
  
  If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
    And scape detecting, I will pay the theft.


    Sound a flourish. [Enter Trumpets and Kettledrums. Danish
    march. [Enter King, Queen, Po
lonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz,
      Guildenstern, and other Lords attendant, with the Guard
      
                 carrying torches.

  Ham. They are coming to the play. I must be idle.
    Get y
ou a place.
  King. How fares our cousin Hamlet?
  Ham. Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's di
sh. I eat the
air,
    promise-cramm'd. You cannot feed capons so.
  King. I have nothing with th
is answer, Hamlet. These words are
not
    mine.
  Ham. No, nor mine now. [To Polonius] My lord, 
you play'd once
    i' th' university, you say?
  Pol. That did I, my lord, and was accounted a go
od actor.
  Ham. What did you enact?
  Pol. I did enact Julius Caesar; I was kill'd i' th' Capitol
;
Brutus
    kill'd me.
  Ham. It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf
there. Be
 
   the players ready.
  Ros. Ay, my lord. They stay upon your patience.
  Queen. Come hither, my d
ear Hamlet, sit by me.
  Ham. No, good mother. Here's metal more attractive.
  Pol. [to the King] 
O, ho! do you mark that?
  Ham. Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
                                  [
Sits down at Ophelia's feet.]

  Oph. No, my lord.
  Ham. I mean, my head upon your lap?
  Oph. 
Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Do you think I meant country matters?
  Oph. I think nothing, my lord.
  Ham.
 That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
  Oph. What is, my lord?
  Ham. Nothing.
  Oph
. You are merry, my lord.
  Ham. Who, I?
  Oph. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. O God, your only jig-maker! W
hat should a man do but be
merry?
    For look you how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father

died
    within 's two hours.
  Oph. Nay 'tis twice two months, my lord.
  Ham. So long? Nay then
, let the devil wear black, for I'll have
a
    suit of sables. O heavens! die two months ago, and
 not
forgotten
    yet? Then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his
life
    half a y
ear. But, by'r Lady, he must build churches then; or
else
    shall he suffer not thinking on, wit
h the hobby-horse, whose

    epitaph is 'For O, for O, the hobby-horse is forgot!'

           
    Hautboys play. The dumb show enters.

    Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen em
bracing
    him and he her. She kneels, and makes show of protestation
    unto him. He takes her 
up, and declines his head upon her
    neck. He lays him down upon a bank of flowers. She, seeing

    him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his
    crown, kisses it, pours poiso
n in the sleeper's ears, and
    leaves him. The Queen returns, finds the King dead, and makes
   
 passionate action. The Poisoner with some three or four
Mutes,
    comes in again, seem to condol
e with her. The dead body is
    carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with gifts; she
    se
ems harsh and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts
    his love.
                             
                            Exeunt.

  Oph. What means this, my lord?
  Ham. Marry, this is michi
ng malhecho; it means mischief.
  Oph. Belike this show imports the argument of the play.

      
                Enter Prologue.

  Ham. We shall know by this fellow. The players cannot keep
cou
nsel;
    they'll tell all.
  Oph. Will he tell us what this show meant?
  Ham. Ay, or any show t
hat you'll show him. Be not you asham'd
to
    show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means.
 
 Oph. You are naught, you are naught! I'll mark the play.

    Pro. For us, and for our tragedy,

      Here stooping to your clemency,
      We beg your hearing patiently.                     [Exi
t.]

  Ham. Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
  Oph. 'Tis brief, my lord.
  Ham. As wom
an's love.

              Enter [two Players as] King and Queen.

    King. Full thirty times ha
th Phoebus' cart gone round
      Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
      And thirty d
ozen moons with borrowed sheen
      About the world have times twelve thirties been,
      Since 
love our hearts, and Hymen did our hands,
      Unite comutual in most sacred bands.
    Queen. So
 many journeys may the sun and moon
      Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
      But woe
 is me! you are so sick of late,
      So far from cheer and from your former state.
      That I 
distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
      Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must;
      For wo
men's fear and love holds quantity,
      In neither aught, or in extremity.
      Now what my lov
e is, proof hath made you know;
      And as my love is siz'd, my fear is so.
      Where love is 
great, the littlest doubts are fear;
      Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.

    King. Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;
      My operant powers their functions 
leave to do.
      And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
      Honour'd, belov'd, and hap
ly one as kind
      For husband shalt thou-
    Queen. O, confound the rest!
      Such love mus
t needs be treason in my breast.
      When second husband let me be accurst!
      None wed the s
econd but who killed the first.

  Ham. [aside] Wormwood, wormwood!

    Queen. The instances th
at second marriage move
      Are base respects of thrift, but none of love.
      A second time I
 kill my husband dead
      When second husband kisses me in bed.
    King. I do believe you think
 what now you speak;
      But what we do determine oft we break.
      Purpose is but the slave t
o memory,
      Of violent birth, but poor validity;
      Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on
 the tree,
      But fall unshaken when they mellow be.
      Most necessary 'tis that we forget

      To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt.
      What to ourselves in passion we propose,
 
     The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
      The violence of either grief or joy
      Th
eir own enactures with themselves destroy.
      Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
  
    Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
      This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not str
ange
      That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
      For 'tis a question left us 
yet to prove,
      Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
      The great man down, you
 mark his favourite flies,
      The poor advanc'd makes friends of enemies;
      And hitherto do
th love on fortune tend,
      For who not needs shall never lack a friend,
      And who in want 
a hollow friend doth try,
      Directly seasons him his enemy.
      But, orderly to end where I 
begun,
      Our wills and fates do so contrary run
      That our devices still are overthrown;

      Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own.
      So think thou wilt no second husband
 wed;
      But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
    Queen. Nor earth to me give food
, nor heaven light,
      Sport and repose lock from me day and night,
      To desperation turn m
y trust and hope,
      An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope,
      Each opposite that blanks t
he face of joy
      Meet what I would have well, and it destroy,
      Both here and hence pursue
 me lasting strife,
      If, once a widow, ever I be wife!

  Ham. If she should break it now!


    King. 'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile.
      My spirits grow dull, and fain I 
would beguile
      The tedious day with sleep.
    Queen. Sleep rock thy brain,
                
                                    [He] sleeps.
      And never come mischance between us twain!

Exit.

  Ham. Madam, how like you this play?
  Queen. The lady doth protest too much, methinks.

  Ham. O, but she'll keep her word.
  King. Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in't?

  Ham. No, no! They do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i'
th'
    world.
  King. What do yo
u call the play?
  Ham. 'The Mousetrap.' Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the
    image of a m
urther done in Vienna. Gonzago is the duke's
name;
    his wife, Baptista. You shall see anon. 'Ti
s a knavish piece
of
    work; but what o' that? Your Majesty, and we that have free
    souls, i
t touches us not. Let the gall'd jade winch; our
withers
    are unwrung.

                     
    Enter Lucianus.

    This is one Lucianus, nephew to the King.
  Oph. You are as good as a ch
orus, my lord.
  Ham. I could interpret between you and your love, if I could
see
    the puppets
 dallying.
  Oph. You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
  Ham. It would cost you a groaning to take
 off my edge.
  Oph. Still better, and worse.
  Ham. So you must take your husbands.- Begin, murth
erer. Pox,
leave
    thy damnable faces, and begin! Come, the croaking raven doth
    bellow for 
revenge.

    Luc. Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
      Confederate sea
son, else no creature seeing;
      Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,
      With Hec
ate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,
      Thy natural magic and dire property
      On whol
esome life usurp immediately.
                                   Pours the poison in his ears.

 
 Ham. He poisons him i' th' garden for's estate. His name's
Gonzago.
    The story is extant, and 
written in very choice Italian. You
    shall see anon how the murtherer gets the love of Gonzago's

wife.
  Oph. The King rises.
  Ham. What, frighted with false fire?
  Queen. How fares my lord?

  Pol. Give o'er the play.
  King. Give me some light! Away!
  All. Lights, lights, lights!
   
                           Exeunt all but Hamlet and Horatio.
  Ham.   Why, let the strucken deer g
o weep,
          The hart ungalled play;
         For some must watch, while some must sleep:
  
        Thus runs the world away.
    Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers- if the rest of

my
    fortunes turn Turk with me-with two Provincial roses on my
raz'd
    shoes, get me a fel
lowship in a cry of players, sir?
  Hor. Half a share.
  Ham.   A whole one I!
         For thou 
dost know, O Damon dear,
           This realm dismantled was
         Of Jove himself; and now re
igns here
           A very, very- pajock.
  Hor. You might have rhym'd.
  Ham. O good Horatio, I
'll take the ghost's word for a thousand
    pound! Didst perceive?
  Hor. Very well, my lord.
  
Ham. Upon the talk of the poisoning?
  Hor. I did very well note him.
  Ham.   Aha! Come, some mus
ic! Come, the recorders!
         For if the King like not the comedy,
         Why then, belike h
e likes it not, perdy.
    Come, some music!

                Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.


  Guil. Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.
  Ham. Sir, a whole history.
  Guil. The K
ing, sir-
  Ham. Ay, sir, what of him?
  Guil. Is in his retirement, marvellous distemper'd.
  Ha
m. With drink, sir?
  Guil. No, my lord; rather with choler.
  Ham. Your wisdom should show itself
 more richer to signify this
to
    the doctor; for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps

    plunge him into far more choler.
  Guil. Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame, and

start
    not so wildly from my affair.
  Ham. I am tame, sir; pronounce.
  Guil. The Queen, you
r mother, in most great affliction of
spirit
    hath sent me to you.
  Ham. You are welcome.
  
Guil. Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right
breed.
    If it shall please you to ma
ke me a wholesome answer, I will
do
    your mother's commandment; if not, your pardon and my retu
rn
    shall be the end of my business.
  Ham. Sir, I cannot.
  Guil. What, my lord?
  Ham. Make
 you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseas'd. But, sir,
such
    answer as I can make, you shall com
mand; or rather, as you
say,
    my mother. Therefore no more, but to the matter! My mother,
you

    say-
  Ros. Then thus she says: your behaviour hath struck her into
    amazement and admirat
ion.
  Ham. O wonderful son, that can so stonish a mother! But is
there no
    sequel at the heel
s of this mother's admiration? Impart.
  Ros. She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you g
o to
bed.
  Ham. We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any
    further trade wit
h us?
  Ros. My lord, you once did love me.
  Ham. And do still, by these pickers and stealers!
 
 Ros. Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? You do
surely
    bar the door upon your own 
liberty, if you deny your griefs
to
    your friend.
  Ham. Sir, I lack advancement.
  Ros. How 
can that be, when you have the voice of the King
himself
    for your succession in Denmark?
  Ha
m. Ay, sir, but 'while the grass grows'- the proverb is
something
    musty.

                  
   Enter the Players with recorders.

    O, the recorders! Let me see one. To withdraw with you- 
why
do
    you go about to recover the wind of me, as if you would drive
me
    into a toil?
  
Guil. O my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too
unmannerly.
  Ham. I do not well understan
d that. Will you play upon this
pipe?
  Guil. My lord, I cannot.
  Ham. I pray you.
  Guil. Beli
eve me, I cannot.
  Ham. I do beseech you.
  Guil. I know, no touch of it, my lord.
  Ham. It is 
as easy as lying. Govern these ventages with your
    fingers and thumbs, give it breath with your 
mouth, and it
will
    discourse most eloquent music. Look you, these are the stops.
  Guil. But 
these cannot I command to any utt'rance of harmony. I
    have not the skill.
  Ham. Why, look you
 now, how unworthy a thing you make of me!
You
    would play upon me; you would seem to know my s
tops; you
would
    pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound me from my
    lowest note
 to the top of my compass; and there is much
music,
    excellent voice, in this little organ, yet
 cannot you make it
    speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am easier to be play'd on than
a
    pipe?
 Call me what instrument you will, though you can fret
me,
    you cannot play upon me.

       
                 Enter Polonius.

    God bless you, sir!
  Pol. My lord, the Queen would speak w
ith you, and presently.
  Ham. Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
  Pol. B
y th' mass, and 'tis like a camel indeed.
  Ham. Methinks it is like a weasel.
  Pol. It is back'd
 like a weasel.
  Ham. Or like a whale.
  Pol. Very like a whale.
  Ham. Then will I come to my m
other by-and-by.- They fool me to
the
    top of my bent.- I will come by-and-by.
  Pol. I will s
ay so.                                      Exit.
  Ham. 'By-and-by' is easily said.- Leave me, fri
ends.
                                        [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]

    'Tis now the very wit
ching time of night,
    When churchyards yawn, and hell itself breathes out
    Contagion to this
 world. Now could I drink hot blood
    And do such bitter business as the day
    Would quake to 
look on. Soft! now to my mother!
    O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever
    The soul of Ne
ro enter this firm bosom.
    Let me be cruel, not unnatural;
    I will speak daggers to her, but
 use none.
    My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites-
    How in my words somever she be shent,

    To give them seals never, my soul, consent!             Exit.




Scene III.
A room in t
he Castle.

Enter King, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.

  King. I like him not, nor stands it sa
fe with us
    To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;
    I your commission will forthwi
th dispatch,
    And he to England shall along with you.
    The terms of our estate may not endur
e
    Hazard so near us as doth hourly grow
    Out of his lunacies.
  Guil. We will ourselves pr
ovide.
    Most holy and religious fear it is
    To keep those many many bodies safe
    That li
ve and feed upon your Majesty.
  Ros. The single and peculiar life is bound
    With all the stren
gth and armour of the mind
    To keep itself from noyance; but much more
    That spirit upon who
se weal depends and rests
    The lives of many. The cesse of majesty
    Dies not alone, but like
 a gulf doth draw
    What's near it with it. It is a massy wheel,
    Fix'd on the summit of the 
highest mount,
    To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
    Are mortis'd and adjoin'd; 
which when it falls,
    Each small annexment, petty consequence,
    Attends the boist'rous ruin.
 Never alone
    Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.
  King. Arm you, I pray you, to this
 speedy voyage;
    For we will fetters put upon this fear,
    Which now goes too free-footed.
 
 Both. We will haste us.
                                               Exeunt Gentlemen.

      
             Enter Polonius.

  Pol. My lord, he's going to his mother's closet.
    Behind the a
rras I'll convey myself
    To hear the process. I'll warrant she'll tax him home;
    And, as you
 said, and wisely was it said,
    'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,
    Since natu
re makes them partial, should o'erhear
    The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege.
    I'
ll call upon you ere you go to bed
    And tell you what I know.
  King. Thanks, dear my lord.
  
                                              Exit [Polonius].
    O, my offence is rank, it smells
 to heaven;
    It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,
    A brother's murther! Pray can I not,

    Though inclination be as sharp as will.
    My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent,
    An
d, like a man to double business bound,
    I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
    And bo
th neglect. What if this cursed hand
    Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,
    Is the
re not rain enough in the sweet heavens
    To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
    But
 to confront the visage of offence?
    And what's in prayer but this twofold force,
    To be for
estalled ere we come to fall,
    Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;
    My fault is past.
 But, O, what form of prayer
    Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murther'?
    That cannot 
be; since I am still possess'd
    Of those effects for which I did the murther-
    My crown, min
e own ambition, and my queen.
    May one be pardon'd and retain th' offence?
    In the corrupted
 currents of this world
    Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,
    And oft 'tis seen the 
wicked prize itself
    Buys out the law; but 'tis not so above.
    There is no shuffling; there 
the action lies
    In his true nature, and we ourselves compell'd,
    Even to the teeth and fore
head of our faults,
    To give in evidence. What then? What rests?
    Try what repentance can. W
hat can it not?
    Yet what can it when one cannot repent?
    O wretched state! O bosom black as
 death!
    O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
    Art more engag'd! Help, angels! Make as
say.
    Bow, stubborn knees; and heart with strings of steel,
    Be soft as sinews of the new-bo
rn babe!
    All may be well.                                  He kneels.

                      
   Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
    And now I'll do't. And so 
he goes to heaven,
    And so am I reveng'd. That would be scann'd.
    A villain kills my father;
 and for that,
    I, his sole son, do this same villain send
    To heaven.
    Why, this is hir
e and salary, not revenge!
    He took my father grossly, full of bread,
    With all his crimes b
road blown, as flush as May;
    And how his audit stands, who knows save heaven?
    But in our c
ircumstance and course of thought,
    'Tis heavy with him; and am I then reveng'd,
    To take hi
m in the purging of his soul,
    When he is fit and seasoned for his passage?
    No.
    Up, sw
ord, and know thou a more horrid hent.
    When he is drunk asleep; or in his rage;
    Or in th' 
incestuous pleasure of his bed;
    At gaming, swearing, or about some act
    That has no relish 
of salvation in't-
    Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,
    And that his soul may
 be as damn'd and black
    As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays.
    This physic but prolong
s thy sickly days.              Exit.
  King. [rises] My words fly up, my thoughts remain below.
 
   Words without thoughts never to heaven go.             Exit.




Scene IV.
The Queen's clos
et.

Enter Queen and Polonius.

  Pol. He will come straight. Look you lay home to him.
    Tel
l him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,
    And that your Grace hath screen'd and stood 
between
    Much heat and him. I'll silence me even here.
    Pray you be round with him.
  Ham. 
(within) Mother, mother, mother!
  Queen. I'll warrant you; fear me not. Withdraw; I hear him
comi
ng.
                              [Polonius hides behind the arras.]

                          E
nter Hamlet.

  Ham. Now, mother, what's the matter?
  Queen. Hamlet, thou hast thy father much o
ffended.
  Ham. Mother, you have my father much offended.
  Queen. Come, come, you answer with an 
idle tongue.
  Ham. Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
  Queen. Why, how now, Hamlet?
  H
am. What's the matter now?
  Queen. Have you forgot me?
  Ham. No, by the rood, not so!
    You a
re the Queen, your husband's brother's wife,
    And (would it were not so!) you are my mother.
  
Queen. Nay, then I'll set those to you that can speak.
  Ham. Come, come, and sit you down. You sha
ll not budge;
    You go not till I set you up a glass
    Where you may see the inmost part of yo
u.
  Queen. What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murther me?
    Help, help, ho!
  Pol. [behind] What
, ho! help, help, help!
  Ham. [draws] How now? a rat? Dead for a ducat, dead!
            [Makes 
a pass through the arras and] kills Polonius.
  Pol. [behind] O, I am slain!
  Queen. O me, what h
ast thou done?
  Ham. Nay, I know not. Is it the King?
  Queen. O, what a rash and bloody deed is 
this!
  Ham. A bloody deed- almost as bad, good mother,
    As kill a king, and marry with his bro
ther.
  Queen. As kill a king?
  Ham. Ay, lady, it was my word.
                         [Lifts u
p the arras and sees Polonius.]
    Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
    I took thee
 for thy better. Take thy fortune.
    Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.
    Leave wring
ing of your hands. Peace! sit you down
    And let me wring your heart; for so I shall
    If it b
e made of penetrable stuff;
    If damned custom have not braz'd it so
    That it is proof and bu
lwark against sense.
  Queen. What have I done that thou dar'st wag thy tongue
    In noise so rud
e against me?
  Ham. Such an act
    That blurs the grace and blush of modesty;
    Calls virtue 
hypocrite; takes off the rose
    From the fair forehead of an innocent love,
    And sets a blist
er there; makes marriage vows
    As false as dicers' oaths. O, such a deed
    As from the body o
f contraction plucks
    The very soul, and sweet religion makes
    A rhapsody of words! Heaven's
 face doth glow;
    Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
    With tristful visage, as against th
e doom,
    Is thought-sick at the act.
  Queen. Ah me, what act,
    That roars so loud and thun
ders in the index?
  Ham. Look here upon th's picture, and on this,
    The counterfeit presentmen
t of two brothers.
    See what a grace was seated on this brow;
    Hyperion's curls; the front o
f Jove himself;
    An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
    A station like the herald Mercu
ry
    New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill:
    A combination and a form indeed
    Where every 
god did seem to set his seal
    To give the world assurance of a man.
    This was your husband. 
Look you now what follows.
    Here is your husband, like a mildew'd ear
    Blasting his wholesom
e brother. Have you eyes?
    Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
    And batten on thi
s moor? Ha! have you eyes
    You cannot call it love; for at your age
    The heyday in the blood
 is tame, it's humble,
    And waits upon the judgment; and what judgment
    Would step from this
 to this? Sense sure you have,
    Else could you not have motion; but sure that sense
    Is apop
lex'd; for madness would not err,
    Nor sense to ecstacy was ne'er so thrall'd
    But it reserv
'd some quantity of choice
    To serve in such a difference. What devil was't
    That thus hath 
cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
    Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
    Ears without ha
nds or eyes, smelling sans all,
    Or but a sickly part of one true sense
    Could not so mope.

    O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
    If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
 
   To flaming youth let virtue be as wax
    And melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame
    When 
the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
    Since frost itself as actively doth burn,
    And reas
on panders will.
  Queen. O Hamlet, speak no more!
    Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul,

    And there I see such black and grained spots
    As will not leave their tinct.
  Ham. Nay, bu
t to live
    In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
    Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making 
love
    Over the nasty sty!
  Queen. O, speak to me no more!
    These words like daggers enter 
in mine ears.
    No more, sweet Hamlet!
  Ham. A murtherer and a villain!
    A slave that is no
t twentieth part the tithe
    Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
    A cutpurse of the empi
re and the rule,
    That from a shelf the precious diadem stole
    And put it in his pocket!
  
Queen. No more!

                Enter the Ghost in his nightgown.

  Ham. A king of shreds and 
patches!-
    Save me and hover o'er me with your wings,
    You heavenly guards! What would your 
gracious figure?
  Queen. Alas, he's mad!
  Ham. Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
    Tha
t, laps'd in time and passion, lets go by
    Th' important acting of your dread command?
    O, s
ay!
  Ghost. Do not forget. This visitation
    Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
    Bu
t look, amazement on thy mother sits.
    O, step between her and her fighting soul
    Conceit in
 weakest bodies strongest works.
    Speak to her, Hamlet.
  Ham. How is it with you, lady?
  Que
en. Alas, how is't with you,
    That you do bend your eye on vacancy,
    And with th' encorporal
 air do hold discourse?
    Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
    And, as the sleeping 
soldiers in th' alarm,
    Your bedded hairs, like life in excrements,
    Start up and stand an e
nd. O gentle son,
    Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
    Sprinkle cool patience! Whereon
 do you look?
  Ham. On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!
    His form and cause conjoin'd
, preaching to stones,
    Would make them capable.- Do not look upon me,
    Lest with this piteo
us action you convert
    My stern effects. Then what I have to do
    Will want true colour- tear
s perchance for blood.
  Queen. To whom do you speak this?
  Ham. Do you see nothing there?
  Que
en. Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
  Ham. Nor did you nothing hear?
  Queen. No, nothing b
ut ourselves.
  Ham. Why, look you there! Look how it steals away!
    My father, in his habit as 
he liv'd!
    Look where he goes even now out at the portal!
                                     
                Exit Ghost.
  Queen. This is the very coinage of your brain.
    This bodiless cre
ation ecstasy
    Is very cunning in.
  Ham. Ecstasy?
    My pulse as yours doth temperately keep
 time
    And makes as healthful music. It is not madness
    That I have utt'red. Bring me to the
 test,
    And I the matter will reword; which madness
    Would gambol from. Mother, for love of 
grace,
    Lay not that flattering unction to your soul
    That not your trespass but my madness 
speaks.
    It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
    Whiles rank corruption, mining all w
ithin,
    Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
    Repent what's past; avoid what is to co
me;
    And do not spread the compost on the weeds
    To make them ranker. Forgive me this my vir
tue;
    For in the fatness of these pursy times
    Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg-
    Y
ea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.
  Queen. O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
 
 Ham. O, throw away the worser part of it,
    And live the purer with the other half,
    Good ni
ght- but go not to my uncle's bed.
    Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
    That monster, cust
om, who all sense doth eat
    Of habits evil, is angel yet in this,
    That to the use of action
s fair and good
    He likewise gives a frock or livery,
    That aptly is put on. Refrain to-nigh
t,
    And that shall lend a kind of easiness
    To the next abstinence; the next more easy;
   
 For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
    And either [master] the devil, or throw him out

    With wondrous potency. Once more, good night;
    And when you are desirous to be blest,
   
 I'll blessing beg of you.- For this same lord,
    I do repent; but heaven hath pleas'd it so,
  
  To punish me with this, and this with me,
    That I must be their scourge and minister.
    I w
ill bestow him, and will answer well
    The death I gave him. So again, good night.
    I must be
 cruel, only to be kind;
    Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.
    One word more, good la
dy.
  Queen. What shall I do?
  Ham. Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
    Let the bloat 
King tempt you again to bed;
    Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
    And let him, 
for a pair of reechy kisses,
    Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,
    Make you to
 ravel all this matter out,
    That I essentially am not in madness,
    But mad in craft. 'Twere
 good you let him know;
    For who that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
    Would from a paddoc
k, from a bat, a gib
    Such dear concernings hide? Who would do so?
    No, in despite of sense 
and secrecy,
    Unpeg the basket on the house's top,
    Let the birds fly, and like the famous a
pe,
    To try conclusions, in the basket creep
    And break your own neck down.
  Queen. Be tho
u assur'd, if words be made of breath,
    And breath of life, I have no life to breathe
    What 
thou hast said to me.
  Ham. I must to England; you know that?
  Queen. Alack,
    I had forgot! 
'Tis so concluded on.
  Ham. There's letters seal'd; and my two schoolfellows,
    Whom I will tru
st as I will adders fang'd,
    They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way
    And marshal me t
o knavery. Let it work;
    For 'tis the sport to have the enginer
    Hoist with his own petar; a
nd 't shall go hard
    But I will delve one yard below their mines
    And blow them at the moon.
 O, 'tis most sweet
    When in one line two crafts directly meet.
    This man shall set me packi
ng.
    I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.-
    Mother, good night.- Indeed, this counsell
or
    Is now most still, most secret, and most grave,
    Who was in life a foolish peating knave
.
    Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.
    Good night, mother.
                  [Exit 
the Queen. Then] Exit Hamlet, tugging in
                                                       Pol
onius.

ACT IV. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King and Quee
n, with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  King. There's matter in these sighs. These profound heave
s
    You must translate; 'tis fit we understand them.
    Where is your son?
  Queen. Bestow thi
s place on us a little while.
                          [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
   
 Ah, mine own lord, what have I seen to-night!
  King. What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
  Queen. M
ad as the sea and wind when both contend
    Which is the mightier. In his lawless fit
    Behind 
the arras hearing something stir,
    Whips out his rapier, cries 'A rat, a rat!'
    And in this 
brainish apprehension kills
    The unseen good old man.
  King. O heavy deed!
    It had been so
 with us, had we been there.
    His liberty is full of threats to all-
    To you yourself, to us
, to every one.
    Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
    It will be laid to us, whose
 providence
    Should have kept short, restrain'd, and out of haunt
    This mad young man. But s
o much was our love
    We would not understand what was most fit,
    But, like the owner of a fo
ul disease,
    To keep it from divulging, let it feed
    Even on the pith of life. Where is he g
one?
  Queen. To draw apart the body he hath kill'd;
    O'er whom his very madness, like some ore

    Among a mineral of metals base,
    Shows itself pure. He weeps for what is done.
  King. O 
Gertrude, come away!
    The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch
    But we will ship him henc
e; and this vile deed
    We must with all our majesty and skill
    Both countenance and excuse. 
Ho, Guildenstern!

             Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

    Friends both, go join y
ou with some further aid.
    Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
    And from his mother's clo
set hath he dragg'd him.
    Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body
    Into the chapel. 
I pray you haste in this.
                          Exeunt [Rosencrantz and Guildenstern].
    Com
e, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends
    And let them know both what we mean to do
    An
d what's untimely done. [So haply slander-]
    Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter,
    As le
vel as the cannon to his blank,
    Transports his poisoned shot- may miss our name
    And hit th
e woundless air.- O, come away!
    My soul is full of discord and dismay.
                       
                                  Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A passage in the Castle.


Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Safely stow'd.
  Gentlemen. (within) Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!
  Ham. But soft!
 What noise? Who calls on Hamlet? O, here they
come.

               Enter Rosencrantz and Guilde
nstern.

  Ros. What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
  Ham. Compounded it with dust, 
whereto 'tis kin.
  Ros. Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
    And bear it to the cha
pel.
  Ham. Do not believe it.
  Ros. Believe what?
  Ham. That I can keep your counsel, and not 
mine own. Besides,
to be
    demanded of a sponge, what replication should be made by the
son
  
  of a king?
  Ros. Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
  Ham. Ay, sir; that soaks up the King's co
untenance, his
rewards,
    his authorities. But such officers do the King best service
in
    t
he end. He keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his
jaw;
    first mouth'd, to be last swallo
wed. When he needs what you
have
    glean'd, it is but squeezing you and, sponge, you shall be
d
ry
    again.
  Ros. I understand you not, my lord.
  Ham. I am glad of it. A knavish speech slee
ps in a foolish ear.
  Ros. My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us
to
    the
 King.
  Ham. The body is with the King, but the King is not with the
body.
    The King is a thi
ng-
  Guil. A thing, my lord?
  Ham. Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.
      
                                                   Exeunt.




Scene III.
Elsinore. A room in 
the Castle.

Enter King.

  King. I have sent to seek him and to find the body.
    How dangero
us is it that this man goes loose!
    Yet must not we put the strong law on him.
    He's lov'd o
f the distracted multitude,
    Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;
    And where 'tis
 so, th' offender's scourge is weigh'd,
    But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,
  
  This sudden sending him away must seem
    Deliberate pause. Diseases desperate grown
    By des
perate appliance are reliev'd,
    Or not at all.

                    Enter Rosencrantz.

    
How now O What hath befall'n?
  Ros. Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
    We cannot get f
rom him.
  King. But where is he?
  Ros. Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
  King
. Bring him before us.
  Ros. Ho, Guildenstern! Bring in my lord.

        Enter Hamlet and Guild
enstern [with Attendants].

  King. Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
  Ham. At supper.
  King. At 
supper? Where?
  Ham. Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A certain
    convocation of polit
ic worms are e'en at him. Your worm is
your
    only emperor for diet. We fat all creatures else t
o fat us,
and
    we fat ourselves for maggots. Your fat king and your lean
beggar
    is but va
riable service- two dishes, but to one table. That's
the
    end.
  King. Alas, alas!
  Ham. A m
an may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and
eat
    of the fish that hath fed of that w
orm.
  King. What dost thou mean by this?
  Ham. Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progr
ess
through
    the guts of a beggar.
  King. Where is Polonius?
  Ham. In heaven. Send thither 
to see. If your messenger find him
not
    there, seek him i' th' other place yourself. But indeed
, if
you
    find him not within this month, you shall nose him as you go
up
    the stair, into
 the lobby.
  King. Go seek him there. [To Attendants.]
  Ham. He will stay till you come.
      
                                      [Exeunt Attendants.]
  King. Hamlet, this deed, for thine esp
ecial safety,-
    Which we do tender as we dearly grieve
    For that which thou hast done,- must
 send thee hence
    With fiery quickness. Therefore prepare thyself.
    The bark is ready and th
e wind at help,
    Th' associates tend, and everything is bent
    For England.
  Ham. For Engla
nd?
  King. Ay, Hamlet.
  Ham. Good.
  King. So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
  Ham. I se
e a cherub that sees them. But come, for England!
    Farewell, dear mother.
  King. Thy loving fa
ther, Hamlet.
  Ham. My mother! Father and mother is man and wife; man and wife
is
    one flesh;
 and so, my mother. Come, for England!
Exit.
  King. Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboa
rd.
    Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night.
    Away! for everything is seal'd and done
 
   That else leans on th' affair. Pray you make haste.
                            Exeunt Rosencran
tz and Guildenstern]
    And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught,-
    As my great power th
ereof may give thee sense,
    Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
    After the Danish swor
d, and thy free awe
    Pays homage to us,- thou mayst not coldly set
    Our sovereign process, w
hich imports at full,
    By letters congruing to that effect,
    The present death of Hamlet. Do
 it, England;
    For like the hectic in my blood he rages,
    And thou must cure me. Till I know
 'tis done,
    Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.             Exit.

S
cene IV.
Near Elsinore.

Enter Fortinbras with his Army over the stage.

  For. Go, Captain, fr
om me greet the Danish king.
    Tell him that by his license Fortinbras
    Craves the conveyance
 of a promis'd march
    Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.
    If that his Majesty would 
aught with us,
    We shall express our duty in his eye;
    And let him know so.
  Capt. I will 
do't, my lord.
  For. Go softly on.
                                   Exeunt [all but the Captain
].

       Enter Hamlet, Rosencrantz, [Guildenstern,] and others.

  Ham. Good sir, whose powers
 are these?
  Capt. They are of Norway, sir.
  Ham. How purpos'd, sir, I pray you?
  Capt. Agains
t some part of Poland.
  Ham. Who commands them, sir?
  Capt. The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras
.
  Ham. Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
    Or for some frontier?
  Capt. Truly to spea
k, and with no addition,
    We go to gain a little patch of ground
    That hath in it no profit 
but the name.
    To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
    Nor will it yield to Norway o
r the Pole
    A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
  Ham. Why, then the Polack never will def
end it.
  Capt. Yes, it is already garrison'd.
  Ham. Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducat
s
    Will not debate the question of this straw.
    This is th' imposthume of much wealth and pe
ace,
    That inward breaks, and shows no cause without
    Why the man dies.- I humbly thank you,
 sir.
  Capt. God b' wi' you, sir.                             [Exit.]
  Ros. Will't please you go
, my lord?
  Ham. I'll be with you straight. Go a little before.
                                 
       [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]
    How all occasions do inform against me
    And spur my dull re
venge! What is a man,
    If his chief good and market of his time
    Be but to sleep and feed? A
 beast, no more.
    Sure he that made us with such large discourse,
    Looking before and after,
 gave us not
    That capability and godlike reason
    To fust in us unus'd. Now, whether it be

    Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple
    Of thinking too precisely on th' event,-
    A th
ought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
    And ever three parts coward,- I do not know
 
   Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do,'
    Sith I have cause, and will, and strength, and m
eans
    To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me.
    Witness this army of such mass and charge
,
    Led by a delicate and tender prince,
    Whose spirit, with divine ambition puff'd,
    Mak
es mouths at the invisible event,
    Exposing what is mortal and unsure
    To all that fortune, 
death, and danger dare,
    Even for an eggshell. Rightly to be great
    Is not to stir without g
reat argument,
    But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
    When honour's at the stake. How stan
d I then,
    That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,
    Excitements of my reason and my blo
od,
    And let all sleep, while to my shame I see
    The imminent death of twenty thousand men

    That for a fantasy and trick of fame
    Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot
    Wh
ereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
    Which is not tomb enough and continent
    To hide the
 slain? O, from this time forth,
    My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!            Exit.

Scene V.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter Horatio, Queen, and a Gentlem
an.

  Queen. I will not speak with her.
  Gent. She is importunate, indeed distract.
    Her mo
od will needs be pitied.
  Queen. What would she have?
  Gent. She speaks much of her father; says
 she hears
    There's tricks i' th' world, and hems, and beats her heart;
    Spurns enviously at
 straws; speaks things in doubt,
    That carry but half sense. Her speech is nothing,
    Yet the
 unshaped use of it doth move
    The hearers to collection; they aim at it,
    And botch the wor
ds up fit to their own thoughts;
    Which, as her winks and nods and gestures yield them,
    Ind
eed would make one think there might be thought,
    Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
  Ho
r. 'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew
    Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding mi
nds.
  Queen. Let her come in.
                                               [Exit Gentleman.]
 
   [Aside] To my sick soul (as sin's true nature is)
    Each toy seems Prologue to some great amis
s.
    So full of artless jealousy is guilt
    It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.

      
           Enter Ophelia distracted.

  Oph. Where is the beauteous Majesty of Denmark?
  Queen. 
How now, Ophelia?
  Oph. (sings)
         How should I your true-love know
           From anothe
r one?
         By his cockle bat and' staff
           And his sandal shoon.

  Queen. Alas, sw
eet lady, what imports this song?
  Oph. Say you? Nay, pray You mark.

    (Sings) He is dead and
 gone, lady,
              He is dead and gone;
            At his head a grass-green turf,
     
         At his heels a stone.

    O, ho!
  Queen. Nay, but Ophelia-
  Oph. Pray you mark.

 
   (Sings) White his shroud as the mountain snow-

                    Enter King.

  Queen. Ala
s, look here, my lord!
  Oph. (Sings)
           Larded all with sweet flowers;
         Which be
wept to the grave did not go
           With true-love showers.

  King. How do you, pretty lady?

  Oph. Well, God dild you! They say the owl was a baker's
daughter.
    Lord, we know what we ar
e, but know not what we may be. God
be at
    your table!
  King. Conceit upon her father.
  Oph
. Pray let's have no words of this; but when they ask, you
what
    it means, say you this:

   
 (Sings) To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,
              All in the morning bedtime,
           
 And I a maid at your window,
              To be your Valentine.

            Then up he rose an
d donn'd his clo'es
              And dupp'd the chamber door,
            Let in the maid, that o
ut a maid
              Never departed more.

  King. Pretty Ophelia!
  Oph. Indeed, la, without
 an oath, I'll make an end on't!

    [Sings] By Gis and by Saint Charity,
              Alack, a
nd fie for shame!
            Young men will do't if they come to't
              By Cock, they ar
e to blame.

            Quoth she, 'Before you tumbled me,
              You promis'd me to wed.
'

    He answers:

            'So would I 'a' done, by yonder sun,
              An thou hads
t not come to my bed.'

  King. How long hath she been thus?
  Oph. I hope all will be well. We m
ust be patient; but I cannot
    choose but weep to think they would lay him i' th' cold
ground.

    My brother shall know of it; and so I thank you for your good
    counsel. Come, my coach! Good
 night, ladies. Good night,
sweet
    ladies. Good night, good night.                         Exit

  King. Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.
                                      
           [Exit Horatio.]

    O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs
    All from her 
father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
    When sorrows come, they come not single spies.
    But i
n battalions! First, her father slain;
    Next, your son gone, and he most violent author
    Of 
his own just remove; the people muddied,
    Thick and and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispe
rs
    For good Polonius' death, and we have done but greenly
    In hugger-mugger to inter him; p
oor Ophelia
    Divided from herself and her fair judgment,
    Without the which we are pictures 
or mere beasts;
    Last, and as much containing as all these,
    Her brother is in secret come f
rom France;
    And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
    Feeds on his wonder, keep, himself in 
clouds,
    With pestilent speeches of his father's death,
    Wherein necessity, of matter beggar
'd,
    Will nothing stick our person to arraign
    In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
  
  Like to a murd'ring piece, in many places
    Give me superfluous death.                  A noise
 within.
  Queen. Alack, what noise is this?
  King. Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the doo
r.

                     Enter a Messenger.

    What is the matter?
  Mess. Save Yourself, my 
lord:
    The ocean, overpeering of his list,
    Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
  
  Than Young Laertes, in a riotous head,
    O'erbears Your offices. The rabble call him lord;
   
 And, as the world were now but to begin,
    Antiquity forgot, custom not known,
    The ratifier
s and props of every word,
    They cry 'Choose we! Laertes shall be king!'
    Caps, hands, and t
ongues applaud it to the clouds,
    'Laertes shall be king! Laertes king!'
                      
                           A noise within.
  Queen. How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!
  
  O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!
  King. The doors are broke.

                    En
ter Laertes with others.

  Laer. Where is this king?- Sirs, staid you all without.
  All. No, le
t's come in!
  Laer. I pray you give me leave.
  All. We will, we will!
  Laer. I thank you. Keep
 the door.      [Exeunt his Followers.]
    O thou vile king,
    Give me my father!
  Queen. Cal
mly, good Laertes.
  Laer. That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard;
    Cries cuckold 
to my father; brands the harlot
    Even here between the chaste unsmirched brows
    Of my true m
other.
  King. What is the cause, Laertes,
    That thy rebellion looks so giantlike?
    Let him
 go, Gertrude. Do not fear our person.
    There's such divinity doth hedge a king
    That treaso
n can but peep to what it would,
    Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,
    Why thou art t
hus incens'd. Let him go, Gertrude.
    Speak, man.
  Laer. Where is my father?
  King. Dead.
  
Queen. But not by him!
  King. Let him demand his fill.
  Laer. How came he dead? I'll not be jugg
led with:
    To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil
    Conscience and grace, to the pr
ofoundest pit!
    I dare damnation. To this point I stand,
    That both the world, I give to neg
ligence,
    Let come what comes; only I'll be reveng'd
    Most throughly for my father.
  King.
 Who shall stay you?
  Laer. My will, not all the world!
    And for my means, I'll husband them s
o well
    They shall go far with little.
  King. Good Laertes,
    If you desire to know the cer
tainty
    Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge
    That sweepstake you will dra
w both friend and foe,
    Winner and loser?
  Laer. None but his enemies.
  King. Will you know 
them then?
  Laer. To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms
    And, like the kind life-rend
'ring pelican,
    Repast them with my blood.
  King. Why, now You speak
    Like a good child an
d a true gentleman.
    That I am guiltless of your father's death,
    And am most sensibly in gr
ief for it,
    It shall as level to your judgment pierce
    As day does to your eye.
          
                    A noise within: 'Let her come in.'
  Laer. How now? What noise is that?

    
                  Enter Ophelia.

    O heat, dry up my brains! Tears seven times salt
    Burn o
ut the sense and virtue of mine eye!
    By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight
    Till o
ur scale turn the beam. O rose of May!
    Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
    O heavens! i
s't possible a young maid's wits
    Should be as mortal as an old man's life?
    Nature is fine 
in love, and where 'tis fine,
    It sends some precious instance of itself
    After the thing it
 loves.

  Oph. (sings)
         They bore him barefac'd on the bier
           (Hey non nony, n
ony, hey nony)
         And in his grave rain'd many a tear.

    Fare you well, my dove!
  Laer
. Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
    It could not move thus.
  Oph. You must sin
g 'A-down a-down, and you call him a-down-a.'
O,
    how the wheel becomes it! It is the false ste
ward, that stole
his
    master's daughter.
  Laer. This nothing's more than matter.
  Oph. Ther
e's rosemary, that's for remembrance. Pray you, love,
    remember. And there is pansies, that's fo
r thoughts.
  Laer. A document in madness! Thoughts and remembrance fitted.
  Oph. There's fennel 
for you, and columbines. There's rue for
you,
    and here's some for me. We may call it herb of g
race o'
Sundays.
    O, you must wear your rue with a difference! There's a daisy.
I
    would g
ive you some violets, but they wither'd all when my
father
    died. They say he made a good end.


    [Sings] For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.

  Laer. Thought and affliction, passion, hell
 itself,
    She turns to favour and to prettiness.
  Oph. (sings)
         And will he not come 
again?
         And will he not come again?
           No, no, he is dead;
           Go to thy d
eathbed;
         He never will come again.

         His beard was as white as snow,
         A
ll flaxen was his poll.
           He is gone, he is gone,
           And we cast away moan.
    
     God 'a'mercy on his soul!

    And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God b' wi' you.
Exit.

  Laer. Do you see this, O God?
  King. Laertes, I must commune with your grief,
    Or you deny
 me right. Go but apart,
    Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will,
    And they shall 
hear and judge 'twixt you and me.
    If by direct or by collateral hand
    They find us touch'd,
 we will our kingdom give,
    Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours,
    To you in satis
faction; but if not,
    Be you content to lend your patience to us,
    And we shall jointly labo
ur with your soul
    To give it due content.
  Laer. Let this be so.
    His means of death, his
 obscure funeral-
    No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,
    No noble rite nor formal
 ostentation,-
    Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
    That I must call't in ques
tion.
  King. So you shall;
    And where th' offence is let the great axe fall.
    I pray you g
o with me.
                                                          Exeunt

  Sailor. God bless you, sir.
  Hor. Let him bless thee too.

  Sailor. 'A shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter for
you,
    sir,- it comes from th' 
ambassador that was bound for
England- if
    your name be Horatio, as I am let to know it is.
  
Hor. (reads the letter) 'Horatio, when thou shalt have
overlook'd
    this, give these fellows som

    letters for him. Ere we were two days old at sea, a pirate of


    very warlike appointment gave us chase. Finding ourselves too
    slow of sail, we put on a co
mpelled valour, and in the
grapple I
    boarded them. On the instant they got clear of our ship; 
so I
    alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with me like
thieves
    of mercy; but they
 knew what they did: I am to do a good turn
for
    them. Let the King have the letters I have sen
t, and repair
thou
    to me with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death. I have
words
    to s
peak in thine ear will make thee dumb; yet are they much
too
    light for the bore of the matter.
 These good fellows will
bring
    thee where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their
cours

Scene VII.
Elsinore. Another room in the Castle.

Enter King and Laertes
.

  King. Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
    And You must put me in your heart fo
r friend,
    Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
    That he which hath your noble fathe
r slain
    Pursued my life.
  Laer. It well appears. But tell me
    Why you proceeded not again
st these feats
    So crimeful and so capital in nature,
    As by your safety, wisdom, all things
 else,
    You mainly were stirr'd up.
  King. O, for two special reasons,
    Which may to you, 
perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,
    But yet to me they are strong. The Queen his mother
    Lives al
most by his looks; and for myself,-
    My virtue or my plague, be it either which,-
    She's so 
conjunctive to my life and soul
    That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
    I could not
 but by her. The other motive
    Why to a public count I might not go
    Is the great love the g
eneral gender bear him,
    Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
    Would, like the sp
ring that turneth wood to stone,
    Convert his gives to graces; so that my arrows,
    Too sligh
tly timber'd for so loud a wind,
    Would have reverted to my bow again,
    And not where I had 
aim'd them.
  Laer. And so have I a noble father lost;
    A sister driven into desp'rate terms,

    Whose worth, if praises may go back again,
    Stood challenger on mount of all the age
    Fo
r her perfections. But my revenge will come.
  King. Break not your sleeps for that. You must not t
hink
    That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
    That we can let our beard be shook with da
nger,
    And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more.
    I lov'd your father, and we love 
ourself,
    And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine-

                 Enter a Messenger wit
h letters.

    How now? What news?
  Mess. Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:
    This to your Maje
sty; this to the Queen.
  King. From Hamlet? Who brought them?
  Mess. Sailors, my lord, they say;
 I saw them not.
    They were given me by Claudio; he receiv'd them
    Of him that brought them.

  King. Laertes, you shall hear them.
    Leave us.
                                            
     Exit Messenger.
    [Reads]'High and Mighty,-You shall know I am set naked on
your
    kingd
om. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes;
    when I shall (first asking your pardon
 thereunto) recount the
    occasion of my sudden and more strange return.
                       
                              'HAMLET.'
    What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?
   
 Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?
  Laer. Know you the hand?
  King. 'Tis Hamlet's characte
r. 'Naked!'
    And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'
    Can you advise me?
  Laer. I am lo
st in it, my lord. But let him come!
    It warms the very sickness in my heart
    That I shall l
ive and tell him to his teeth,
    'Thus didest thou.'
  King. If it be so, Laertes
    (As how s
hould it be so? how otherwise?),
    Will you be rul'd by me?
  Laer. Ay my lord,
    So you will
 not o'errule me to a peace.
  King. To thine own peace. If he be now return'd
    As checking at 
his voyage, and that he means
    No more to undertake it, I will work him
    To exploit now ripe
 in my device,
    Under the which he shall not choose but fall;
    And for his death no wind sha
ll breathe
    But even his mother shall uncharge the practice
    And call it accident.
  Laer. 
My lord, I will be rul'd;
    The rather, if you could devise it so
    That I might be the organ.

  King. It falls right.
    You have been talk'd of since your travel much,
    And that in Haml
et's hearing, for a quality
    Wherein they say you shine, Your sum of parts
    Did not together
 pluck such envy from him
    As did that one; and that, in my regard,
    Of the unworthiest sieg
e.
  Laer. What part is that, my lord?
  King. A very riband in the cap of youth-
    Yet needful
l too; for youth no less becomes
    The light and careless livery that it wears
    Than settled 
age his sables and his weeds,
    Importing health and graveness. Two months since
    Here was a 
gentleman of Normandy.
    I have seen myself, and serv'd against, the French,
    And they can we
ll on horseback; but this gallant
    Had witchcraft in't. He grew unto his seat,
    And to such 
wondrous doing brought his horse
    As had he been incorps'd and demi-natur'd
    With the brave 
beast. So far he topp'd my thought
    That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
    Come short of 
what he did.
  Laer. A Norman was't?
  King. A Norman.
  Laer. Upon my life, Lamound.
  King. Th
e very same.
  Laer. I know him well. He is the broach indeed
    And gem of all the nation.
  Ki
ng. He made confession of you;
    And gave you such a masterly report
    For art and exercise in
 your defence,
    And for your rapier most especially,
    That he cried out 'twould be a sight i
ndeed
    If one could match you. The scrimers of their nation
    He swore had neither motion, gu
ard, nor eye,
    If you oppos'd them. Sir, this report of his
    Did Hamlet so envenom with his 
envy
    That he could nothing do but wish and beg
    Your sudden coming o'er to play with you.

    Now, out of this-
  Laer. What out of this, my lord?
  King. Laertes, was your father dear to 
you?
    Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
    A face without a heart,'
  Laer. Why ask y
ou this?
  King. Not that I think you did not love your father;
    But that I know love is begun 
by time,
    And that I see, in passages of proof,
    Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
 
   There lives within the very flame of love
    A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
    A
nd nothing is at a like goodness still;
    For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
    Dies in his ow
n too-much. That we would do,
    We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes,
    And ha
th abatements and delays as many
    As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
    And then 
this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
    That hurts by easing. But to the quick o' th' ulcer!

    Hamlet comes back. What would you undertake
    To show yourself your father's son in deed
  
  More than in words?
  Laer. To cut his throat i' th' church!
  King. No place indeed should murt
her sanctuarize;
    Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,
    Will you do this? Keep 
close within your chamber.
    Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home.
    We'll put on thos
e shall praise your excellence
    And set a double varnish on the fame
    The Frenchman gave you
; bring you in fine together
    And wager on your heads. He, being remiss,
    Most generous, and
 free from all contriving,
    Will not peruse the foils; so that with ease,
    Or with a little 
shuffling, you may choose
    A sword unbated, and, in a pass of practice,
    Requite him for you
r father.
  Laer. I will do't!
    And for that purpose I'll anoint my sword.
    I bought an unc
tion of a mountebank,
    So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
    Where it draws blood no catap
lasm so rare,
    Collected from all simples that have virtue
    Under the moon, can save the thi
ng from death
    This is but scratch'd withal. I'll touch my point
    With this contagion, that,
 if I gall him slightly,
    It may be death.
  King. Let's further think of this,
    Weigh what
 convenience both of time and means
    May fit us to our shape. If this should fall,
    And that
 our drift look through our bad performance.
    'Twere better not assay'd. Therefore this project

    Should have a back or second, that might hold
    If this did blast in proof. Soft! let me see
.
    We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings-
    I ha't!
    When in your motion you are hot
 and dry-
    As make your bouts more violent to that end-
    And that he calls for drink, I'll h
ave prepar'd him
    A chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,
    If he by chance escape your
 venom'd stuck,
    Our purpose may hold there.- But stay, what noise,

                         
  Enter Queen.

    How now, sweet queen?
  Queen. One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
    S
o fast they follow. Your sister's drown'd, Laertes.
  Laer. Drown'd! O, where?
  Queen. There is a
 willow grows aslant a brook,
    That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream.
    There with 
fantastic garlands did she come
    Of crowflowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,
    That l
iberal shepherds give a grosser name,
    But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them.
    
There on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds
    Clamb'ring to hang, an envious sliver broke,
   
 When down her weedy trophies and herself
    Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide
 
   And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up;
    Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes,

    As one incapable of her own distress,
    Or like a creature native and indued
    Unto that e
lement; but long it could not be
    Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
    Pull'd th
e poor wretch from her melodious lay
    To muddy death.
  Laer. Alas, then she is drown'd?
  Que
en. Drown'd, drown'd.
  Laer. Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
    And therefore I forbi
d my tears; but yet
    It is our trick; nature her custom holds,
    Let shame say what it will. 
When these are gone,
    The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord.
    I have a speech of fire, that 
fain would blaze
    But that this folly douts it.                          Exit.
  King. Let's fo
llow, Gertrude.
    How much I had to do to calm his rage I
    Now fear I this will give it start
 again;
    Therefore let's follow.
                                                         Exeun
t.

ACT V. Scene I.
Elsinore. A churchyard.

Enter two Clowns, [with spades a
nd pickaxes].

  Clown. Is she to be buried in Christian burial when she
wilfully
    seeks her 
own salvation?
  Other. I tell thee she is; therefore make her grave straight.
    The crowner hat
h sate on her, and finds it Christian burial.
  Clown. How can that be, unless she drown'd herself 
in her own
    defence?
  Other. Why, 'tis found so.
  Clown. It must be se offendendo; it cannot
 be else. For here
lies
    the point: if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act; and
an
   
 act hath three branches-it is to act, to do, and to perform;
    argal, she drown'd herself wittin
gly.
  Other. Nay, but hear you, Goodman Delver!
  Clown. Give me leave. Here lies the water; good
. Here stands
the
    man; good. If the man go to this water and drown himself, it
is,
    will 
he nill he, he goes- mark you that. But if the water
come to
    him and drown him, he drowns not 
himself. Argal, he that is
not
    guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.
  Other. Bu
t is this law?
  Clown. Ay, marry, is't- crowner's quest law.
  Other. Will you ha' the truth an't
? If this had not been a
    gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o' Christian
burial.
  
Clown. Why, there thou say'st! And the more pity that great
folk
    should have count'nance in th
is world to drown or hang
themselves
    more than their even-Christian. Come, my spade! There is 
no
    ancient gentlemen but gard'ners, ditchers, and grave-makers.
They
    hold up Adam's profe
ssion.
  Other. Was he a gentleman?
  Clown. 'A was the first that ever bore arms.
  Other. Why, 
he had none.
  Clown. What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the
Scripture?
    The Script
ure says Adam digg'd. Could he dig without arms?
I'll
    put another question to thee. If thou an
swerest me not to the
    purpose, confess thyself-
  Other. Go to!
  Clown. What is he that buil
ds stronger than either the mason,
the
    shipwright, or the carpenter?
  Other. The gallows-mak
er; for that frame outlives a thousand
    tenants.
  Clown. I like thy wit well, in good faith. T
he gallows does
well.
    But how does it well? It does well to those that do ill. Now,
    thou 
dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the
    church. Argal, the gallows may do well t
o thee. To't again,
come!
  Other. Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a
    carpe
nter?
  Clown. Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
  Other. Marry, now I can tell!
  Clown. To't.
  Ot
her. Mass, I cannot tell.

                 Enter Hamlet and Horatio afar off.

  Clown. Cudgel 
thy brains no more about it, for your dull ass
will
    not mend his pace with beating; and when y
ou are ask'd this
    question next, say 'a grave-maker.' The houses he makes lasts
    till dooms
day. Go, get thee to Yaughan; fetch me a stoup of
    liquor.
                                    
        [Exit Second Clown.]


                       [Clown digs and] sings.

       In youth 
when I did love, did love,
         Methought it was very sweet;
       To contract- O- the time f
or- a- my behove,
         O, methought there- a- was nothing- a- meet.

  Ham. Has this fellow n
o feeling of his business, that he sings
at
    grave-making?
  Hor. Custom hath made it in him a
 property of easiness.
  Ham. 'Tis e'en so. The hand of little employment hath the
daintier
    s
ense.
  Clown. (sings)
         But age with his stealing steps
           Hath clawed me in his 
clutch,
         And hath shipped me intil the land,
           As if I had never been such.
    
                                        [Throws up a skull.]

  Ham. That skull had a tongue in it
, and could sing once. How
the
    knave jowls it to the ground,as if 'twere Cain's jawbone,
that

    did the first murther! This might be the pate of a
Politician,
    which this ass now o'erre
aches; one that would circumvent
God,
    might it not?
  Hor. It might, my lord.
  Ham. Or of a
 courtier, which could say 'Good morrow, sweet
lord!
    How dost thou, good lord?' This might be 
my Lord Such-a-one,
that
    prais'd my Lord Such-a-one's horse when he meant to beg it-
might
 
   it not?
  Hor. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Why, e'en so! and now my Lady Worm's, chapless, and
knock'd

    about the mazzard with a sexton's spade. Here's fine
revolution,
    and we had the trick to
 see't. Did these bones cost no more
the
    breeding but to play at loggets with 'em? Mine ache t
o think
    on't.
  Clown. (Sings)
         A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,
           For and a
 shrouding sheet;
         O, a Pit of clay for to be made
           For such a guest is meet.
 
                                     Throws up [another skull].

  Ham. There's another. Why may n
ot that be the skull of a
lawyer?
    Where be his quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, his
ten
ures,
    and his tricks? Why does he suffer this rude knave now to
knock
    him about the sconc
e with a dirty shovel, and will not tell
him
    of his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might 
be in's time
a
    great buyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizances,
his
    fines, his
 double vouchers, his recoveries. Is this the fine
of
    his fines, and the recovery of his recov
eries, to have his
fine
    pate full of fine dirt? Will his vouchers vouch him no more
of
    h
is purchases, and double ones too, than the length and
breadth
    of a pair of indentures? The ve
ry conveyances of his lands
will
    scarcely lie in this box; and must th' inheritor himself have

no
    more, ha?
  Hor. Not a jot more, my lord.
  Ham. Is not parchment made of sheepskins?
 
 Hor. Ay, my lord, And of calveskins too.
  Ham. They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance
 in
that. I
    will speak to this fellow. Whose grave's this, sirrah?
  Clown. Mine, sir.

   
 [Sings] O, a pit of clay for to be made
              For such a guest is meet.

  Ham. I think 
it be thine indeed, for thou liest in't.
  Clown. You lie out on't, sir, and therefore 'tis not you
rs.
    For my part, I do not lie in't, yet it is mine.
  Ham. Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and 
say it is thine. 'Tis
for
    the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.
  Clown. 'Tis a 
quick lie, sir; 'twill away again from me to you.
  Ham. What man dost thou dig it for?
  Clown. F
or no man, sir.
  Ham. What woman then?
  Clown. For none neither.
  Ham. Who is to be buried in'
t?
  Clown. One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's
dead.
  Ham. How absolute the kn
ave is! We must speak by the card, or
    equivocation will undo us. By the Lord, Horatio, this thr
ee
years
    I have taken note of it, the age is grown so picked that the
toe
    of the peasant
 comes so near the heel of the courtier he
galls
    his kibe.- How long hast thou been a grave-ma
ker?
  Clown. Of all the days i' th' year, I came to't that day that
our
    last king Hamlet ove
rcame Fortinbras.
  Ham. How long is that since?
  Clown. Cannot you tell that? Every fool can tel
l that. It was
the
    very day that young Hamlet was born- he that is mad, and sent
    into Eng
land.
  Ham. Ay, marry, why was be sent into England?
  Clown. Why, because 'a was mad. 'A shall r
ecover his wits
there;
    or, if 'a do not, 'tis no great matter there.
  Ham. Why?
  Clown. 'T
will not he seen in him there. There the men are as
mad as
    he.
  Ham. How came he mad?
  Clo
wn. Very strangely, they say.
  Ham. How strangely?
  Clown. Faith, e'en with losing his wits.
  
Ham. Upon what ground?
  Clown. Why, here in Denmark. I have been sexton here, man and
boy
    th
irty years.
  Ham. How long will a man lie i' th' earth ere he rot?
  Clown. Faith, if 'a be not r
otten before 'a die (as we have
many
    pocky corses now-a-days that will scarce hold the laying 
in,
I
    will last you some eight year or nine year. A tanner will
last
    you nine year.
  H
am. Why he more than another?
  Clown. Why, sir, his hide is so tann'd with his trade that 'a
will

    keep out water a great while; and your water is a sore
decayer of
    your whoreson dead bod
y. Here's a skull now. This skull hath
lien
    you i' th' earth three-and-twenty years.
  Ham. W
hose was it?
  Clown. A whoreson, mad fellow's it was. Whose do you think it
was?
  Ham. Nay, I k
now not.
  Clown. A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! 'A pour'd a flagon
of
    Rhenish on my he
ad once. This same skull, sir, was Yorick's
    skull, the King's jester.
  Ham. This?
  Clown. E
'en that.
  Ham. Let me see. [Takes the skull.] Alas, poor Yorick! I knew
him,
    Horatio. A fel
low of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy.
He
    hath borne me on his back a thousand times. 
And now how
abhorred
    in my imagination it is! My gorge rises at it. Here hung
those
    lips
 that I have kiss'd I know not how oft. Where be your
gibes
    now? your gambols? your songs? you
r flashes of merriment that
    were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock
your
 
   own grinning? Quite chap- fall'n? Now get you to my lady's
    chamber, and tell her, let her pa
int an inch thick, to this
    favour she must come. Make her laugh at that. Prithee,
Horatio,
  
  tell me one thing.
  Hor. What's that, my lord?
  Ham. Dost thou think Alexander look'd o' this 
fashion i' th'
earth?
  Hor. E'en so.
  Ham. And smelt so? Pah!
                                
          [Puts down the skull.]
  Hor. E'en so, my lord.
  Ham. To what base uses we may return, 
Horatio! Why may not
    imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it
    stoppin
g a bunghole?
  Hor. 'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.
  Ham. No, faith, not a jot
; but to follow him thither with
modesty
    enough, and likelihood to lead it; as thus: Alexander
 died,
    Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust
is
    earth; of earth w
e make loam; and why of that loam (whereto
he
    was converted) might they not stop a beer barrel
?
    Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
    Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.
   
 O, that that earth which kept the world in awe
    Should patch a wall t' expel the winter's flaw!

    But soft! but soft! aside! Here comes the King-

    Enter [priests with] a coffin [in funer
al procession], King,
             Queen, Laertes, with Lords attendant.]

    The Queen, the cou
rtiers. Who is this they follow?
    And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken
    The corse t
hey follow did with desp'rate hand
    Fordo it own life. 'Twas of some estate.
    Couch we awhil
e, and mark.
                                         [Retires with Horatio.]

  Laer. What cerem
ony else?
  Ham. That is Laertes,
    A very noble youth. Mark.
  Laer. What ceremony else?
  Pr
iest. Her obsequies have been as far enlarg'd
    As we have warranty. Her death was doubtful;
   
 And, but that great command o'ersways the order,
    She should in ground unsanctified have lodg'd

    Till the last trumpet. For charitable prayers,
    Shards, flints, and pebbles should be thro
wn on her.
    Yet here she is allow'd her virgin rites,
    Her maiden strewments, and the bringi
ng home
    Of bell and burial.
  Laer. Must there no more be done?
  Priest. No more be done.
 
   We should profane the service of the dead
    To sing a requiem and such rest to her
    As to 
peace-parted souls.
  Laer. Lay her i' th' earth;
    And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
    
May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,
    A minist'ring angel shall my sister be
    W
hen thou liest howling.
  Ham. What, the fair Ophelia?
  Queen. Sweets to the sweet! Farewell.
  
                                           [Scatters flowers.]
    I hop'd thou shouldst have been 
my Hamlet's wife;
    I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
    And not have strew'd
 thy grave.
  Laer. O, treble woe
    Fall ten times treble on that cursed head
    Whose wicked 
deed thy most ingenious sense
    Depriv'd thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,
    Till I have cau
ght her once more in mine arms.
                                             Leaps in the grave.
 
   Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead
    Till of this flat a mountain you have made
    T
' o'ertop old Pelion or the skyish head
    Of blue Olympus.
  Ham. [comes forward] What is he who
se grief
    Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow
    Conjures the wand'ring stars, and 
makes them stand
    Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,
    Hamlet the Dane.                 
   [Leaps in after Laertes.
  Laer. The devil take thy soul!
                                     
       [Grapples with him].
  Ham. Thou pray'st not well.
    I prithee take thy fingers from my t
hroat;
    For, though I am not splenitive and rash,
    Yet have I in me something dangerous,
  
  Which let thy wisdom fear. Hold off thy hand!
  King. Pluck them asunder.
  Queen. Hamlet, Hamle
t!
  All. Gentlemen!
  Hor. Good my lord, be quiet.
             [The Attendants part them, and t
hey come out of the
                                                         grave.]
  Ham. Why, I
 will fight with him upon this theme
    Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
  Queen. O my son, w
hat theme?
  Ham. I lov'd Ophelia. Forty thousand brothers
    Could not (with all their quantity 
of love)
    Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?
  King. O, he is mad, Laertes.
  Queen. F
or love of God, forbear him!
  Ham. 'Swounds, show me what thou't do.
    Woo't weep? woo't fight?
 woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?
    Woo't drink up esill? eat a crocodile?
    I'll do't. Dost th
ou come here to whine?
    To outface me with leaping in her grave?
    Be buried quick with her, 
and so will I.
    And if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
    Millions of acres on us, til
l our ground,
    Singeing his pate against the burning zone,
    Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an t
hou'lt mouth,
    I'll rant as well as thou.
  Queen. This is mere madness;
    And thus a while 
the fit will work on him.
    Anon, as patient as the female dove
    When that her golden couplet
s are disclos'd,
    His silence will sit drooping.
  Ham. Hear you, sir!
    What is the reason 
that you use me thus?
    I lov'd you ever. But it is no matter.
    Let Hercules himself do what 
he may,
    The cat will mew, and dog will have his day.
Exit.
  King. I pray thee, good Horatio,
 wait upon him.
                                                   Exit Horatio.
    [To Laertes] 
Strengthen your patience in our last night's
speech.
    We'll put the matter to the present push.
-
    Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.-
    This grave shall have a living monument.

    An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
    Till then in patience our proceeding be.
          
                                               Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A hall in the C
astle.

Enter Hamlet and Horatio.

  Ham. So much for this, sir; now shall you see the other.
 
   You do remember all the circumstance?
  Hor. Remember it, my lord!
  Ham. Sir, in my heart ther
e was a kind of fighting
    That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay
    Worse than the mutin
ies in the bilboes. Rashly-
    And prais'd be rashness for it; let us know,
    Our indiscretion 
sometime serves us well
    When our deep plots do pall; and that should learn us
    There's a di
vinity that shapes our ends,
    Rough-hew them how we will-
  Hor. That is most certain.
  Ham. 
Up from my cabin,
    My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
    Grop'd I to find out them; had
 my desire,
    Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew
    To mine own room again; making so 
bold
    (My fears forgetting manners) to unseal
    Their grand commission; where I found, Horati
o
    (O royal knavery!), an exact command,
    Larded with many several sorts of reasons,
    Im
porting Denmark's health, and England's too,
    With, hoo! such bugs and goblins in my life-
    
That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
    No, not to stay the finding of the axe,
    My head 
should be struck off.
  Hor. Is't possible?
  Ham. Here's the commission; read it at more leisure.

    But wilt thou bear me how I did proceed?
  Hor. I beseech you.
  Ham. Being thus benetted ro
und with villanies,
    Or I could make a prologue to my brains,
    They had begun the play. I sa
t me down;
    Devis'd a new commission; wrote it fair.
    I once did hold it, as our statists do
,
    A baseness to write fair, and labour'd much
    How to forget that learning; but, sir, now

    It did me yeoman's service. Wilt thou know
    Th' effect of what I wrote?
  Hor. Ay, good my 
lord.
  Ham. An earnest conjuration from the King,
    As England was his faithful tributary,
   
 As love between them like the palm might flourish,
    As peace should still her wheaten garland w
ear
    And stand a comma 'tween their amities,
    And many such-like as's of great charge,
    
That, on the view and knowing of these contents,
    Without debatement further, more or less,
   
 He should the bearers put to sudden death,
    Not shriving time allow'd.
  Hor. How was this sea
l'd?
  Ham. Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
    I had my father's signet in my purse,
    
Which was the model of that Danish seal;
    Folded the writ up in the form of th' other,
    Subs
crib'd it, gave't th' impression, plac'd it safely,
    The changeling never known. Now, the next d
ay
    Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent
    Thou know'st already.
  Hor. So Guilde
nstern and Rosencrantz go to't.
  Ham. Why, man, they did make love to this employment!
    They a
re not near my conscience; their defeat
    Does by their own insinuation grow.
    'Tis dangerous
 when the baser nature comes
    Between the pass and fell incensed points
    Of mighty opposites
.
  Hor. Why, what a king is this!
  Ham. Does it not, thinks't thee, stand me now upon-
    He t
hat hath kill'd my king, and whor'd my mother;
    Popp'd in between th' election and my hopes;
  
  Thrown out his angle for my proper life,
    And with such coz'nage- is't not perfect conscience

    To quit him with this arm? And is't not to be damn'd
    To let this canker of our nature come

    In further evil?
  Hor. It must be shortly known to him from England
    What is the issue o
f the business there.
  Ham. It will be short; the interim is mine,
    And a man's life is no mor
e than to say 'one.'
    But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
    That to Laertes I forgot myself,

    For by the image of my cause I see
    The portraiture of his. I'll court his favours.
    But
 sure the bravery of his grief did put me
    Into a tow'ring passion.
  Hor. Peace! Who comes her
e?

                 Enter young Osric, a courtier.

  Osr. Your lordship is right welcome back 
to Denmark.
  Ham. I humbly thank you, sir. [Aside to Horatio] Dost know this
    waterfly?
  Hor
. [aside to Hamlet] No, my good lord.
  Ham. [aside to Horatio] Thy state is the more gracious; for

'tis a
    vice to know him. He hath much land, and fertile. Let a beast
be
    lord of beasts,
 and his crib shall stand at the king's mess.
'Tis
    a chough; but, as I say, spacious in the po
ssession of dirt.

  Osr. Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should
impart
    a th
ing to you from his Majesty.
  Ham. I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit. Put
your

    bonnet to his right use. 'Tis for the head.
  Osr. I thank your lordship, it is very hot.
  
Ham. No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly.
  Osr. It is indifferent cold, my lord,
 indeed.
  Ham. But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my
complexion.
  Osr. Exceedingly,
 my lord; it is very sultry, as 'twere- I
cannot
    tell how. But, my lord, his Majesty bade me s
ignify to you
that
    he has laid a great wager on your head. Sir, this is the
matter-
  Ham. I
 beseech you remember.
                           [Hamlet moves him to put on his hat.]
  Osr. Nay
, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here
is
    newly come to court Laertes; believ
e me, an absolute
gentleman,
    full of most excellent differences, of very soft society and
   
 great showing. Indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the
card
    or calendar of gentry; for y
ou shall find in him the
continent of
    what part a gentleman would see.
  Ham. Sir, his define
ment suffers no perdition in you; though, I

    know, to divide him inventorially would dozy th' 
arithmetic
of
    memory, and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail.
    But, in the v
erity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of
great
    article, and his infusion of such dearth 
and rareness as, to
make
    true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror, and who
else
    
would trace him, his umbrage, nothing more.
  Osr. Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
  
Ham. The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our
more
    rawer breath?
  Osr. Sir?

  Hor [aside to Hamlet] Is't not possible to understand in
another
    tongue? You will do't, si
r, really.
  Ham. What imports the nomination of this gentleman?
  Osr. Of Laertes?
  Hor. [aside
] His purse is empty already. All's golden words are
    spent.
  Ham. Of him, sir.
  Osr. I know
 you are not ignorant-
  Ham. I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would
not
    m
uch approve me. Well, sir?
  Osr. You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is-
  Ham. I dar
e not confess that, lest I should compare with him in
    excellence; but to know a man well were t
o know himself.
  Osr. I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on
him
    by them
, in his meed he's unfellowed.
  Ham. What's his weapon?
  Osr. Rapier and dagger.
  Ham. That's 
two of his weapons- but well.
  Osr. The King, sir, hath wager'd with him six Barbary horses;
    
against the which he has impon'd, as I take it, six French
    rapiers and poniards, with their ass
igns, as girdle, hangers,
and
    so. Three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy,
 
   very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of
    very liberal conceit.
  Ham. 
What call you the carriages?
  Hor. [aside to Hamlet] I knew you must be edified by the
margent
 
   ere you had done.
  Osr. The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
  Ham. The phrase would be more g
ermane to the matter if we could
    carry cannon by our sides. I would it might be hangers till
t
hen.
    But on! Six Barbary horses against six French swords, their
    assigns, and three libera
l-conceited carriages: that's the
French
    bet against the Danish. Why is this all impon'd, as y
ou call
it?
  Osr. The King, sir, hath laid that, in a dozen passes between
    yourself and him,
 he shall not exceed you three hits; he hath
    laid on twelve for nine, and it would come to imme
diate trial
    if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.
  Ham. How if I answer no?
  Osr. I 
mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
  Ham. Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If
 it please his
Majesty,
    it is the breathing time of day with me. Let the foils be
    brought
, the gentleman willing, and the King hold his
purpose,
    I will win for him if I can; if not, I
 will gain nothing but
my
    shame and the odd hits.
  Osr. Shall I redeliver you e'en so?
  Ha
m. To this effect, sir, after what flourish your nature will.
  Osr. I commend my duty to your lord
ship.
  Ham. Yours, yours. [Exit Osric.] He does well to commend it
    himself; there are no tong
ues else for's turn.
  Hor. This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.
  Ham. He did compl
y with his dug before he suck'd it. Thus has
he,
    and many more of the same bevy that I know th
e drossy age
dotes
    on, only got the tune of the time and outward habit of
encounter-
    a k
ind of yesty collection, which carries them through and
    through the most fann'd and winnowed op
inions; and do but
blow
    them to their trial-the bubbles are out,

                          
  Enter a Lord.

  Lord. My lord, his Majesty commended him to you by young Osric,
who
    bring
s back to him, that you attend him in the hall. He sends
to
    know if your pleasure hold to play
 with Laertes, or that you
will
    take longer time.
  Ham. I am constant to my purposes; they f
ollow the King's
pleasure.
    If his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or whensoever,
provided

    I be so able as now.
  Lord. The King and Queen and all are coming down.
  Ham. In happy time
.
  Lord. The Queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to
    Laertes before you fall to
 play.
  Ham. She well instructs me.
                                                    [Exit Lor
d.]
  Hor. You will lose this wager, my lord.
  Ham. I do not think so. Since he went into France 
I have been
in
    continual practice. I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst
not
    think h
ow ill all's here about my heart. But it is no matter.
  Hor. Nay, good my lord -
  Ham. It is but
 foolery; but it is such a kind of gaingiving as
    would perhaps trouble a woman.
  Hor. If your
 mind dislike anything, obey it. I will forestall
their
    repair hither and say you are not fit.

  Ham. Not a whit, we defy augury; there's a special providence
in
    the fall of a sparrow. If
 it be now, 'tis not to come; if it
be
    not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it w
ill
come:
    the readiness is all. Since no man knows aught of what he
leaves,
    what is't to
 leave betimes? Let be.

    Enter King, Queen, Laertes, Osric, and Lords, with other
           
   Attendants with foils and gauntlets.
               A table and flagons of wine on it.

  King
. Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
                    [The King puts Laertes' hand 
into Hamlet's.]
  Ham. Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong;
    But pardon't, as you a
re a gentleman.
    This presence knows,
    And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd
   
 With sore distraction. What I have done
    That might your nature, honour, and exception
    Rou
ghly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
    Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet.
    If Ha
mlet from himself be taken away,
    And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
    Then Hamlet
 does it not, Hamlet denies it.
    Who does it, then? His madness. If't be so,
    Hamlet is of t
he faction that is wrong'd;
    His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
    Sir, in this audience,
  
  Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd evil
    Free me so far in your most generous thoughts
    Th
at I have shot my arrow o'er the house
    And hurt my brother.
  Laer. I am satisfied in nature,

    Whose motive in this case should stir me most
    To my revenge. But in my terms of honour
  
  I stand aloof, and will no reconcilement
    Till by some elder masters of known honour
    I ha
ve a voice and precedent of peace
    To keep my name ungor'd. But till that time
    I do receive
 your offer'd love like love,
    And will not wrong it.
  Ham. I embrace it freely,
    And will
 this brother's wager frankly play.
    Give us the foils. Come on.
  Laer. Come, one for me.
  H
am. I'll be your foil, Laertes. In mine ignorance
    Your skill shall, like a star i' th' darkest 
night,
    Stick fiery off indeed.
  Laer. You mock me, sir.
  Ham. No, by this hand.
  King. Gi
ve them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
    You know the wager?
  Ham. Very well, my lord.

    Your Grace has laid the odds o' th' weaker side.
  King. I do not fear it, I have seen you bot
h;
    But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.
  Laer. This is too heavy; let me see ano
ther.
  Ham. This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
                                  
              Prepare to play.
  Osr. Ay, my good lord.
  King. Set me the stoups of wine upon tha
t table.
    If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
    Or quit in answer of the third exchange,

    Let all the battlements their ordnance fire;
    The King shall drink to Hamlet's better breat
h,
    And in the cup an union shall he throw
    Richer than that which four successive kings
  
  In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;
    And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
   
 The trumpet to the cannoneer without,
    The cannons to the heavens, the heaven to earth,
    'N
ow the King drinks to Hamlet.' Come, begin.
    And you the judges, bear a wary eye.
  Ham. Come o
n, sir.
  Laer. Come, my lord.                                They play.
  Ham. One.
  Laer. No.

  Ham. Judgment!
  Osr. A hit, a very palpable hit.
  Laer. Well, again!
  King. Stay, give me d
rink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
    Here's to thy health.
               [Drum; trumpets sound;
 a piece goes off [within].
    Give him the cup.
  Ham. I'll play this bout first; set it by awhi
le.
    Come. (They play.) Another hit. What say you?
  Laer. A touch, a touch; I do confess't.
 
 King. Our son shall win.
  Queen. He's fat, and scant of breath.
    Here, Hamlet, take my napkin
, rub thy brows.
    The Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
  Ham. Good madam!
  King. Gertru
de, do not drink.
  Queen. I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.          Drinks.
  King. [aside]
 It is the poison'd cup; it is too late.
  Ham. I dare not drink yet, madam; by-and-by.
  Queen. C
ome, let me wipe thy face.
  Laer. My lord, I'll hit him now.
  King. I do not think't.
  Laer. [
aside] And yet it is almost against my conscience.
  Ham. Come for the third, Laertes! You but dall
y.
    Pray you pass with your best violence;
    I am afeard you make a wanton of me.
  Laer. Sa
y you so? Come on.                               Play.
  Osr. Nothing neither way.
  Laer. Have at
 you now!
                [Laertes wounds Hamlet; then] in scuffling, they
                    cha
nge rapiers, [and Hamlet wounds Laertes].
  King. Part them! They are incens'd.
  Ham. Nay come! a
gain!                         The Queen falls.

  Osr. Look to the Queen there, ho!
  Hor. They b
leed on both sides. How is it, my lord?
  Osr. How is't, Laertes?
  Laer. Why, as a woodcock to mi
ne own springe, Osric.
    I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.
  Ham. How does the Queen?

  King. She sounds to see them bleed.
  Queen. No, no! the drink, the drink! O my dear Hamlet!
  
  The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.                 [Dies.]
  Ham. O villany! Ho! let the door b
e lock'd.
    Treachery! Seek it out.
                                                [Laertes fal
ls.]
  Laer. It is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain;
    No medicine in the world can do thee 
good.
    In thee there is not half an hour of life.
    The treacherous instrument is in thy hand
,
    Unbated and envenom'd. The foul practice
    Hath turn'd itself on me. Lo, here I lie,
    
Never to rise again. Thy mother's poison'd.
    I can no more. The King, the King's to blame.
  Ha
m. The point envenom'd too?
    Then, venom, to thy work.                    Hurts the King.
  All
. Treason! treason!
  King. O, yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt.
  Ham. Here, thou incestuous
, murd'rous, damned Dane,
    Drink off this potion! Is thy union here?
    Follow my mother.     
                            King dies.
  Laer. He is justly serv'd.
    It is a poison temper'd by
 himself.
    Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet.
    Mine and my father's death come not 
upon thee,
    Nor thine on me!                                       Dies.
  Ham. Heaven make the
e free of it! I follow thee.
    I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!
    You that look pale
 and tremble at this chance,
    That are but mutes or audience to this act,
    Had I but time (a
s this fell sergeant, Death,
    Is strict in his arrest) O, I could tell you-
    But let it be. 
Horatio, I am dead;
    Thou liv'st; report me and my cause aright
    To the unsatisfied.
  Hor.
 Never believe it.
    I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.
    Here's yet some liquor left.
 
 Ham. As th'art a man,
    Give me the cup. Let go! By heaven, I'll ha't.
    O good Horatio, what
 a wounded name
    (Things standing thus unknown) shall live behind me!
    If thou didst ever ho
ld me in thy heart,
    Absent thee from felicity awhile,
    And in this harsh world draw thy bre
ath in pain,
    To tell my story.         [March afar off, and shot within.]
    What warlike noi
se is this?
  Osr. Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
    To the ambassadors of Eng
land gives
    This warlike volley.
  Ham. O, I die, Horatio!
    The potent poison quite o'ercro
ws my spirit.
    I cannot live to hear the news from England,
    But I do prophesy th' election 
lights
    On Fortinbras. He has my dying voice.
    So tell him, with th' occurrents, more and le
ss,
    Which have solicited- the rest is silence.             Dies.
  Hor. Now cracks a noble hea
rt. Good night, sweet prince,
    And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
                   
                              [March within.]
    Why does the drum come hither?

    Enter Forti
nbras and English Ambassadors, with Drum,
                  Colours, and Attendants.

  Fort. Whe
re is this sight?
  Hor. What is it you will see?
    If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search
.
  Fort. This quarry cries on havoc. O proud Death,
    What feast is toward in thine eternal cel
l
    That thou so many princes at a shot
    So bloodily hast struck.
  Ambassador. The sight is
 dismal;
    And our affairs from England come too late.
    The ears are senseless that should gi
ve us hearing
    To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd
    That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern a
re dead.
    Where should we have our thanks?
  Hor. Not from his mouth,
    Had it th' ability o
f life to thank you.
    He never gave commandment for their death.
    But since, so jump upon th
is bloody question,
    You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
    Are here arriv'd, give
 order that these bodies
    High on a stage be placed to the view;
    And let me speak to the ye
t unknowing world
    How these things came about. So shall you hear
    Of carnal, bloody and unn
atural acts;
    Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters;
    Of deaths put on by cunning and f
orc'd cause;
    And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
    Fall'n on th' inventors' heads. All thi
s can I
    Truly deliver.
  Fort. Let us haste to hear it,
    And call the noblest to the audie
nce.
    For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.
    I have some rights of memory in this kingdo
m
    Which now, to claim my vantage doth invite me.
  Hor. Of that I shall have also cause to spe
ak,
    And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more.
    But let this same be presently perfo
rm'd,
    Even while men's minds are wild, lest more mischance
    On plots and errors happen.
  
Fort. Let four captains
    Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage;
    For he was likely, had he
 been put on,
    To have prov'd most royally; and for his passage
    The soldiers' music and the
 rites of war
    Speak loudly for him.
    Take up the bodies. Such a sight as this
    Becomes 
the field but here shows much amiss.
    Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
            Exeunt marching; 
after the which a peal of ordnance
                                                   are shot off.

ACT I. Scene I.
Elsinore. A platform befo
re the Castle.

Enter two Sentinels-[first,] Francisco, [who paces up and down
at his post; then]
 Bernardo, [who approaches him].

  Ber. Who's there?
  Fran. Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yo
urself.
  Ber. Long live the King!
  Fran. Bernardo?
  Ber. He.
  Fran. You come most carefully 
upon your hour.
  Ber. 'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.
  Fran. For this relief
 much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold,
    And I am sick at heart.
  Ber. Have you had quiet guard?
  Fr
an. Not a mouse stirring.
  Ber. Well, good night.
    If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
    
The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.

                    Enter Horatio and Marcellus.


  Fran. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?
  Hor. Friends to this ground.
  Mar. And li
egemen to the Dane.
  Fran. Give you good night.
  Mar. O, farewell, honest soldier.
    Who hath
 reliev'd you?
  Fran. Bernardo hath my place.
    Give you good night.                           
        Exit.
  Mar. Holla, Bernardo!
  Ber. Say-
    What, is Horatio there ?
  Hor. A piece of
 him.
  Ber. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.
  Mar. What, has this thing appear'd again
 to-night?
  Ber. I have seen nothing.
  Mar. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
    And will not
 let belief take hold of him
    Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.
    Therefore I ha
ve entreated him along,
    With us to watch the minutes of this night,
    That, if again this ap
parition come,
    He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
  Hor. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.

  Ber. Sit down awhile,
    And let us once again assail your ears,
    That are so fortified aga
inst our story,
    What we two nights have seen.
  Hor. Well, sit we down,
    And let us hear B
ernardo speak of this.
  Ber. Last night of all,
    When yond same star that's westward from the 
pole
    Had made his course t' illume that part of heaven
    Where now it burns, Marcellus and m
yself,
    The bell then beating one-

                        Enter Ghost.

  Mar. Peace! brea
k thee off! Look where it comes again!
  Ber. In the same figure, like the King that's dead.
  Mar
. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
  Ber. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.
 
 Hor. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.
  Ber. It would be spoke to.
  Mar. Question 
it, Horatio.
  Hor. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night
    Together with that fair and
 warlike form
    In which the majesty of buried Denmark
    Did sometimes march? By heaven I char
ge thee speak!
  Mar. It is offended.
  Ber. See, it stalks away!
  Hor. Stay! Speak, speak! I ch
arge thee speak!
                                                     Exit Ghost.
  Mar. 'Tis gone
 and will not answer.
  Ber. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale.
    Is not this somethin
g more than fantasy?
    What think you on't?
  Hor. Before my God, I might not this believe
    
Without the sensible and true avouch
    Of mine own eyes.
  Mar. Is it not like the King?
  Hor.
 As thou art to thyself.
    Such was the very armour he had on
    When he th' ambitious Norway c
ombated.
    So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,
    He smote the sledded Polacks on the i
ce.
    'Tis strange.
  Mar. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
    With martial stal
k hath he gone by our watch.
  Hor. In what particular thought to work I know not;
    But, in the
 gross and scope of my opinion,
    This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
  Mar. Good now
, sit down, and tell me he that knows,
    Why this same strict and most observant watch
    So ni
ghtly toils the subject of the land,
    And why such daily cast of brazen cannon
    And foreign 
mart for implements of war;
    Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
    Does not divi
de the Sunday from the week.
    What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
    Doth make the ni
ght joint-labourer with the day?
    Who is't that can inform me?
  Hor. That can I.
    At least
, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
    Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
    Was, as you
 know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
    Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
    Dar'd to the c
ombat; in which our valiant Hamlet
    (For so this side of our known world esteem'd him)
    Did 
slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,
    Well ratified by law and heraldry,
    Did for
feit, with his life, all those his lands
    Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror;
    Again
st the which a moiety competent
    Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
    To the inheritan
ce of Fortinbras,
    Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant
    And carriage of the art
icle design'd,
    His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
    Of unimproved mettle hot an
d full,
    Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,
    Shark'd up a list of lawless resolut
es,
    For food and diet, to some enterprise
    That hath a stomach in't; which is no other,
  
  As it doth well appear unto our state,
    But to recover of us, by strong hand
    And terms co
mpulsatory, those foresaid lands
    So by his father lost; and this, I take it,
    Is the main m
otive of our preparations,
    The source of this our watch, and the chief head
    Of this post-h
aste and romage in the land.
  Ber. I think it be no other but e'en so.
    Well may it sort that 
this portentous figure
    Comes armed through our watch, so like the King
    That was and is the
 question of these wars.
  Hor. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
    In the most high and p
almy state of Rome,
    A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
    The graves stood tenantless, a
nd the sheeted dead
    Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;
    As stars with trains of fi
re, and dews of blood,
    Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
    Upon whose influence Neptu
ne's empire stands
    Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.
    And even the like precurse of
 fierce events,
    As harbingers preceding still the fates
    And prologue to the omen coming on
,
    Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
    Unto our climature and countrymen.

      
                Enter Ghost again.

    But soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again!
    I'll cros
s it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!
                                               Spreads hi
s arms.
    If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
    Speak to me.
    If there be any good th
ing to be done,
    That may to thee do ease, and, race to me,
    Speak to me.
    If thou art p
rivy to thy country's fate,
    Which happily foreknowing may avoid,
    O, speak!
    Or if thou
 hast uphoarded in thy life
    Extorted treasure in the womb of earth
    (For which, they say, y
ou spirits oft walk in death),
                                                 The cock crows.
  
  Speak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!
  Mar. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?

  Hor. Do, if it will not stand.
  Ber. 'Tis here!
  Hor. 'Tis here!
  Mar. 'Tis gone!
        
                                             Exit Ghost.
    We do it wrong, being so majestical,

    To offer it the show of violence;
    For it is as the air, invulnerable,
    And our vain blo
ws malicious mockery.
  Ber. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
  Hor. And then it started
, like a guilty thing
    Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
    The cock, that is the trumpet t
o the morn,
    Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
    Awake the god of day; and at hi
s warning,
    Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
    Th' extravagant and erring spirit hies

    To his confine; and of the truth herein
    This present object made probation.
  Mar. It fa
ded on the crowing of the cock.
    Some say that ever, 'gainst that season comes
    Wherein our 
Saviour's birth is celebrated,
    The bird of dawning singeth all night long;
    And then, they 
say, no spirit dare stir abroad,
    The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,
    No fair
y takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
    So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
  Hor. So hav
e I heard and do in part believe it.
    But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
    Walks o'er
 the dew of yon high eastward hill.
    Break we our watch up; and by my advice
    Let us impart 
what we have seen to-night
    Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
    This spirit, dumb to us, 
will speak to him.
    Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
    As needful in our loves, 
fitting our duty?
    Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
    Where we shall find him most
 conveniently.           Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A room of state in the Castle.

Flo
urish. [Enter Claudius, King of Denmark, Gertrude the Queen,
Hamlet,
Polonius, Laertes and his sis
ter Ophelia, [Voltemand, Cornelius,]
Lords Attendant.

  King. Though yet of Hamlet our dear brot
her's death
    The memory be green, and that it us befitted
    To bear our hearts in grief, and 
our whole kingdom
    To be contracted in one brow of woe,
    Yet so far hath discretion fought w
ith nature
    That we with wisest sorrow think on him
    Together with remembrance of ourselves.

    Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
    Th' imperial jointress to this warlike stat
e,
    Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,
    With an auspicious, and a dropping eye,
    Wi
th mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,
    In equal scale weighing delight and dole,
   
 Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd
    Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
    With
 this affair along. For all, our thanks.
    Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
    Hol
ding a weak supposal of our worth,
    Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
    Our state 
to be disjoint and out of frame,
    Colleagued with this dream of his advantage,
    He hath not 
fail'd to pester us with message
    Importing the surrender of those lands
    Lost by his father
, with all bands of law,
    To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
    Now for ourself and
 for this time of meeting.
    Thus much the business is: we have here writ
    To Norway, uncle o
f young Fortinbras,
    Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears
    Of this his nephew's purpose,
 to suppress
    His further gait herein, in that the levies,
    The lists, and full proportions 
are all made
    Out of his subject; and we here dispatch
    You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltem
and,
    For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,
    Giving to you no further personal power

    To business with the King, more than the scope
    Of these dilated articles allow.            
[Gives a paper.]
    Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
  Cor., Volt. In that, and al
l things, will we show our duty.
  King. We doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell.
                 
                Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius.
    And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
  
  You told us of some suit. What is't, Laertes?
    You cannot speak of reason to the Dane
    And
 lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
    That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?

    The head is not more native to the heart,
    The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
    Tha
n is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
    What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
  Laer. My dread lo
rd,
    Your leave and favour to return to France;
    From whence though willingly I came to Denm
ark
    To show my duty in your coronation,
    Yet now I must confess, that duty done,
    My th
oughts and wishes bend again toward France
    And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
  K
ing. Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
  Pol. He hath, my lord, wrung from me my sl
ow leave
    By laboursome petition, and at last
    Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent.
    
I do beseech you give him leave to go.
  King. Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,
    And
 thy best graces spend it at thy will!
    But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son-
  Ham. [aside] A
 little more than kin, and less than kind!
  King. How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
  
Ham. Not so, my lord. I am too much i' th' sun.
  Queen. Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,

    And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
    Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
   
 Seek for thy noble father in the dust.
    Thou know'st 'tis common. All that lives must die,
   
 Passing through nature to eternity.
  Ham. Ay, madam, it is common.
  Queen. If it be,
    Why s
eems it so particular with thee?
  Ham. Seems, madam, Nay, it is. I know not 'seems.'
    'Tis not
 alone my inky cloak, good mother,
    Nor customary suits of solemn black,
    Nor windy suspirat
ion of forc'd breath,
    No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
    Nor the dejected havior of th
e visage,
    Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
    'That can denote me truly. Thes
e indeed seem,
    For they are actions that a man might play;
    But I have that within which pa
sseth show-
    These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
  King. 'Tis sweet and commendable i
n your nature, Hamlet,
    To give these mourning duties to your father;
    But you must know, yo
ur father lost a father;
    That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
    In filial obli
gation for some term
    To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever
    In obstinate condolement is 
a course
    Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief;
    It shows a will most incorrect to he
aven,
    A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
    An understanding simple and unschool'd;
    
For what we know must be, and is as common
    As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
    Why shou
ld we in our peevish opposition
    Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
    A fault aga
inst the dead, a fault to nature,
    To reason most absurd, whose common theme
    Is death of fa
thers, and who still hath cried,
    From the first corse till he that died to-day,
    'This must
 be so.' We pray you throw to earth
    This unprevailing woe, and think of us
    As of a father;
 for let the world take note
    You are the most immediate to our throne,
    And with no less no
bility of love
    Than that which dearest father bears his son
    Do I impart toward you. For yo
ur intent
    In going back to school in Wittenberg,
    It is most retrograde to our desire;
   
 And we beseech you, bend you to remain
    Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
    Our chie
fest courtier, cousin, and our son.
  Queen. Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.
    I pr
ay thee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.
  Ham. I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
  King.
 Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.
    Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come.
    This gentle a
nd unforc'd accord of Hamlet
    Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,
    No jocund health 
that Denmark drinks to-day
    But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
    And the King's r
ouse the heaven shall bruit again,
    Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.
                    
            Flourish. Exeunt all but Hamlet.
  Ham. O that this too too solid flesh would melt,
  
  Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!
    Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
    His canon 'ga
inst self-slaughter! O God! God!
    How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
    Seem to me all t
he uses of this world!
    Fie on't! ah, fie! 'Tis an unweeded garden
    That grows to seed; thin
gs rank and gross in nature
    Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
    But two months
 dead! Nay, not so much, not two.
    So excellent a king, that was to this
    Hyperion to a saty
r; so loving to my mother
    That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
    Visit her face too 
roughly. Heaven and earth!
    Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him
    As if increase of a
ppetite had grown
    By what it fed on; and yet, within a month-
    Let me not think on't! Frail
ty, thy name is woman!-
    A little month, or ere those shoes were old
    With which she followe
d my poor father's body
    Like Niobe, all tears- why she, even she
    (O God! a beast that want
s discourse of reason
    Would have mourn'd longer) married with my uncle;
    My father's brothe
r, but no more like my father
    Than I to Hercules. Within a month,
    Ere yet the salt of most
 unrighteous tears
    Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
    She married. O, most wicked s
peed, to post
    With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
    It is not, nor it cannot come to g
ood.
    But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue!

          Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and 
Bernardo.

  Hor. Hail to your lordship!
  Ham. I am glad to see you well.
    Horatio!- or I do
 forget myself.
  Hor. The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
  Ham. Sir, my good friend- 
I'll change that name with you.
    And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?
    Marcellus?
  
Mar. My good lord!
  Ham. I am very glad to see you.- [To Bernardo] Good even, sir.-

    But wha
t, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
  Hor. A truant disposition, good my lord.
  Ham. I would n
ot hear your enemy say so,
    Nor shall you do my ear that violence
    To make it truster of you
r own report
    Against yourself. I know you are no truant.
    But what is your affair in Elsino
re?
    We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
  Hor. My lord, I came to see your father's 
funeral.
  Ham. I prithee do not mock me, fellow student.
    I think it was to see my mother's we
dding.
  Hor. Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.
  Ham. Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral 
bak'd meats
    Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
    Would I had met my dearest foe i
n heaven
    Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
    My father- methinks I see my father.
  Hor
. O, where, my lord?
  Ham. In my mind's eye, Horatio.
  Hor. I saw him once. He was a goodly king
.
  Ham. He was a man, take him for all in all.
    I shall not look upon his like again.
  Hor. 
My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
  Ham. Saw? who?
  Hor. My lord, the King your father.
  
Ham. The King my father?
  Hor. Season your admiration for a while
    With an attent ear, till I 
may deliver
    Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
    This marvel to you.
  Ham. For God's lov
e let me hear!
  Hor. Two nights together had these gentlemen
    (Marcellus and Bernardo) on thei
r watch
    In the dead vast and middle of the night
    Been thus encount'red. A figure like your
 father,
    Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
    Appears before them and with solemn march
    
Goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walk'd
    By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
  
  Within his truncheon's length; whilst they distill'd
    Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
 
   Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
    In dreadful secrecy impart they did,
    And I 
with them the third night kept the watch;
    Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
    Form
 of the thing, each word made true and good,
    The apparition comes. I knew your father.
    The
se hands are not more like.
  Ham. But where was this?
  Mar. My lord, upon the platform where we 
watch'd.
  Ham. Did you not speak to it?
  Hor. My lord, I did;
    But answer made it none. Yet 
once methought
    It lifted up it head and did address
    Itself to motion, like as it would spe
ak;
    But even then the morning cock crew loud,
    And at the sound it shrunk in haste away
  
  And vanish'd from our sight.
  Ham. 'Tis very strange.
  Hor. As I do live, my honour'd lord, 't
is true;
    And we did think it writ down in our duty
    To let you know of it.
  Ham. Indeed, 
indeed, sirs. But this troubles me.
    Hold you the watch to-night?
  Both [Mar. and Ber.] We do,
 my lord.
  Ham. Arm'd, say you?
  Both. Arm'd, my lord.
  Ham. From top to toe?
  Both. My lord
, from head to foot.
  Ham. Then saw you not his face?
  Hor. O, yes, my lord! He wore his beaver 
up.
  Ham. What, look'd he frowningly.
  Hor. A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
  Ham. 
Pale or red?
  Hor. Nay, very pale.
  Ham. And fix'd his eyes upon you?
  Hor. Most constantly.

  Ham. I would I had been there.
  Hor. It would have much amaz'd you.
  Ham. Very like, very like
. Stay'd it long?
  Hor. While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
  Both. Longer, longe
r.
  Hor. Not when I saw't.
  Ham. His beard was grizzled- no?
  Hor. It was, as I have seen it i
n his life,
    A sable silver'd.
  Ham. I will watch to-night.
    Perchance 'twill walk again.

  Hor. I warr'nt it will.
  Ham. If it assume my noble father's person,
    I'll speak to it, tho
ugh hell itself should gape
    And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
    If you have hitherto
 conceal'd this sight,
    Let it be tenable in your silence still;
    And whatsoever else shall 
hap to-night,
    Give it an understanding but no tongue.
    I will requite your loves. So, fare 
you well.
    Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
    I'll visit you.
  All. Our duty to
 your honour.
  Ham. Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell.
                                       
 Exeunt [all but Hamlet].
    My father's spirit- in arms? All is not well.
    I doubt some foul 
play. Would the night were come!
    Till then sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,
    Thoug
h all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
Exit.




Scene III.
Elsinore. A room in the h
ouse of Polonius.

Enter Laertes and Ophelia.

  Laer. My necessaries are embark'd. Farewell.
 
   And, sister, as the winds give benefit
    And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
    But let m
e hear from you.
  Oph. Do you doubt that?
  Laer. For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,
  
  Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood;
    A violet in the youth of primy nature,
    Forward, n
ot permanent- sweet, not lasting;
    The perfume and suppliance of a minute;
    No more.
  Oph.
 No more but so?
  Laer. Think it no more.
    For nature crescent does not grow alone
    In the
ws and bulk; but as this temple waxes,
    The inward service of the mind and soul
    Grows wide 
withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
    And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
    The virtue of h
is will; but you must fear,
    His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
    For he himself
 is subject to his birth.
    He may not, as unvalued persons do,
    Carve for himself, for on hi
s choice depends
    The safety and health of this whole state,
    And therefore must his choice 
be circumscrib'd
    Unto the voice and yielding of that body
    Whereof he is the head. Then if 
he says he loves you,
    It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
    As he in his particular act
 and place
    May give his saying deed; which is no further
    Than the main voice of Denmark go
es withal.
    Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain
    If with too credent ear you list h
is songs,
    Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
    To his unmast'red importunity.

    Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
    And keep you in the rear of your affection,
  
  Out of the shot and danger of desire.
    The chariest maid is prodigal enough
    If she unmask
 her beauty to the moon.
    Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes.
    The canker galls the
 infants of the spring
    Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd,
    And in the morn and liqu
id dew of youth
    Contagious blastments are most imminent.
    Be wary then; best safety lies in
 fear.
    Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
  Oph. I shall th' effect of this good l
esson keep
    As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
    Do not as some ungracious pastor
s do,
    Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven,
    Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless liber
tine,
    Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads
    And recks not his own rede.
  Laer. O
, fear me not!

                       Enter Polonius.

    I stay too long. But here my father 
comes.
    A double blessing is a double grace;
    Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
  Pol. Y
et here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame!
    The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
    A
nd you are stay'd for. There- my blessing with thee!
    And these few precepts in thy memory
    
Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
    Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.
    
Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar:
    Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
 
   Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel;
    But do not dull thy palm with entertainment

    Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware
    Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,
  
  Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee.
    Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice;
   
 Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
    Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
   
 But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
    For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
    And t
hey in France of the best rank and station
    Are most select and generous, chief in that.
    Ne
ither a borrower nor a lender be;
    For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
    And borrowing
 dulls the edge of husbandry.
    This above all- to thine own self be true,
    And it must follo
w, as the night the day,
    Thou canst not then be false to any man.
    Farewell. My blessing se
ason this in thee!
  Laer. Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
  Pol. The time invites you. G
o, your servants tend.
  Laer. Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well
    What I have said to you.

  Oph. 'Tis in my memory lock'd,
    And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
  Laer. Farewell. 
                                         Exit.
  Pol. What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?
  O
ph. So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
  Pol. Marry, well bethought!
    'Tis told
 me he hath very oft of late
    Given private time to you, and you yourself
    Have of your audi
ence been most free and bounteous.
    If it be so- as so 'tis put on me,
    And that in way of c
aution- I must tell you
    You do not understand yourself so clearly
    As it behooves my daught
er and your honour.
    What is between you? Give me up the truth.
  Oph. He hath, my lord, of lat
e made many tenders
    Of his affection to me.
  Pol. Affection? Pooh! You speak like a green gir
l,
    Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
    Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?

  Oph. I do not know, my lord, what I should think,
  Pol. Marry, I will teach you! Think yourself 
a baby
    That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
    Which are not sterling. Tender your
self more dearly,
    Or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
    Running it thus) you'll te
nder me a fool.
  Oph. My lord, he hath importun'd me with love
    In honourable fashion.
  Pol.
 Ay, fashion you may call it. Go to, go to!
  Oph. And hath given countenance to his speech, my lor
d,
    With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
  Pol. Ay, springes to catch woodcocks! I do know,

    When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
    Lends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter
,
    Giving more light than heat, extinct in both
    Even in their promise, as it is a-making,

    You must not take for fire. From this time
    Be something scanter of your maiden presence.
 
   Set your entreatments at a higher rate
    Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
    Belie
ve so much in him, that he is young,
    And with a larger tether may he walk
    Than may be give
n you. In few, Ophelia,
    Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
    Not of that dye whi
ch their investments show,
    But mere implorators of unholy suits,
    Breathing like sanctified
 and pious bawds,
    The better to beguile. This is for all:
    I would not, in plain terms, fro
m this time forth
    Have you so slander any moment leisure
    As to give words or talk with the
 Lord Hamlet.
    Look to't, I charge you. Come your ways.
  Oph. I shall obey, my lord.
        
                                                 Exeunt.




Scene IV.
Elsinore. The platform 
before the Castle.

Enter Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus.

  Ham. The air bites shrewdly; it is 
very cold.
  Hor. It is a nipping and an eager air.
  Ham. What hour now?
  Hor. I think it lacks
 of twelve.
  Mar. No, it is struck.
  Hor. Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws near the season

    Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
                   A flourish of trumpets, and two p
ieces go off.
    What does this mean, my lord?
  Ham. The King doth wake to-night and takes his r
ouse,
    Keeps wassail, and the swagg'ring upspring reels,
    And, as he drains his draughts of 
Rhenish down,
    The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out
    The triumph of his pledge.
  Hor. 
Is it a custom?
  Ham. Ay, marry, is't;
    But to my mind, though I am native here
    And to th
e manner born, it is a custom
    More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
    This heavy-
headed revel east and west
    Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations;
    They clip us drun
kards and with swinish phrase
    Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
    From our achievements
, though perform'd at height,
    The pith and marrow of our attribute.
    So oft it chances in p
articular men
    That, for some vicious mole of nature in them,
    As in their birth,- wherein t
hey are not guilty,
    Since nature cannot choose his origin,-
    By the o'ergrowth of some comp
lexion,
    Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
    Or by some habit that too much o'
erleavens
    The form of plausive manners, that these men
    Carrying, I say, the stamp of one d
efect,
    Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,
    Their virtues else- be they as pure as gr
ace,
    As infinite as man may undergo-
    Shall in the general censure take corruption
    Fro
m that particular fault. The dram of e'il
    Doth all the noble substance often dout To his own sc
andal.

                         Enter Ghost.

  Hor. Look, my lord, it comes!
  Ham. Angels an
d ministers of grace defend us!
    Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
    Bring with th
ee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
    Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
    Thou com'st 
in such a questionable shape
    That I will speak to thee. I'll call thee Hamlet,
    King, fathe
r, royal Dane. O, answer me?
    Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell
    Why thy canoniz'd bon
es, hearsed in death,
    Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre
    Wherein we saw thee qu
ietly inurn'd,
    Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws
    To cast thee up again. What may thi
s mean
    That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,
    Revisits thus the glimpses of the m
oon,
    Making night hideous, and we fools of nature
    So horridly to shake our disposition
  
  With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
    Say, why is this? wherefore? What should we do
?
                                           Ghost beckons Hamlet.
  Hor. It beckons you to go awa
y with it,
    As if it some impartment did desire
    To you alone.
  Mar. Look with what courte
ous action
    It waves you to a more removed ground.
    But do not go with it!
  Hor. No, by no
 means!
  Ham. It will not speak. Then will I follow it.
  Hor. Do not, my lord!
  Ham. Why, what
 should be the fear?
    I do not set my life at a pin's fee;
    And for my soul, what can it do 
to that,
    Being a thing immortal as itself?
    It waves me forth again. I'll follow it.
  Hor
. What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
    Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
    T
hat beetles o'er his base into the sea,
    And there assume some other, horrible form
    Which m
ight deprive your sovereignty of reason
    And draw you into madness? Think of it.
    The very p
lace puts toys of desperation,
    Without more motive, into every brain
    That looks so many fa
doms to the sea
    And hears it roar beneath.
  Ham. It waves me still.
    Go on. I'll follow t
hee.
  Mar. You shall not go, my lord.
  Ham. Hold off your hands!
  Hor. Be rul'd. You shall not
 go.
  Ham. My fate cries out
    And makes each petty artire in this body
    As hardy as the Ne
mean lion's nerve.
                                                [Ghost beckons.]

    Still am
 I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
    By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!-
    I say,
 away!- Go on. I'll follow thee.
                                        Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet.

  Hor. He waxes desperate with imagination.
  Mar. Let's follow. 'Tis not fit thus to obey him.
  
Hor. Have after. To what issue will this come?
  Mar. Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.

  Hor. Heaven will direct it.
  Mar. Nay, let's follow him.
                                     
                    Exeunt.




Scene V.
Elsinore. The Castle. Another part of the fortificati
ons.

Enter Ghost and Hamlet.

  Ham. Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak! I'll go no further.
  G
host. Mark me.
  Ham. I will.
  Ghost. My hour is almost come,
    When I to sulph'rous and torme
nting flames
    Must render up myself.
  Ham. Alas, poor ghost!
  Ghost. Pity me not, but lend t
hy serious hearing
    To what I shall unfold.
  Ham. Speak. I am bound to hear.
  Ghost. So art 
thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
  Ham. What?
  Ghost. I am thy father's spirit,
    Doom'd
 for a certain term to walk the night,
    And for the day confin'd to fast in fires,
    Till the
 foul crimes done in my days of nature
    Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid
    To 
tell the secrets of my prison house,
    I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
    Would harro
w up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
    Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,

    Thy knotted and combined locks to part,
    And each particular hair to stand on end
    Lik
e quills upon the fretful porcupine.
    But this eternal blazon must not be
    To ears of flesh 
and blood. List, list, O, list!
    If thou didst ever thy dear father love-
  Ham. O God!
  Ghos
t. Revenge his foul and most unnatural murther.
  Ham. Murther?
  Ghost. Murther most foul, as in 
the best it is;
    But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.
  Ham. Haste me to know't, that I,
 with wings as swift
    As meditation or the thoughts of love,
    May sweep to my revenge.
  Gh
ost. I find thee apt;
    And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
    That rots itself in ea
se on Lethe wharf,
    Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.
    'Tis given out that, 
sleeping in my orchard,
    A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark
    Is by a forged pro
cess of my death
    Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth,
    The serpent that did sting thy
 father's life
    Now wears his crown.
  Ham. O my prophetic soul!
    My uncle?
  Ghost. Ay, t
hat incestuous, that adulterate beast,
    With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts-
    
O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
    So to seduce!- won to his shameful lust
    The wi
ll of my most seeming-virtuous queen.
    O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there,
    From me, who
se love was of that dignity
    That it went hand in hand even with the vow
    I made to her in m
arriage, and to decline
    Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
    To those of mine!
   
 But virtue, as it never will be mov'd,
    Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
    So 
lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
    Will sate itself in a celestial bed
    And prey on ga
rbage.
    But soft! methinks I scent the morning air.
    Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orc
hard,
    My custom always of the afternoon,
    Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
    With ju
ice of cursed hebona in a vial,
    And in the porches of my ears did pour
    The leperous distil
ment; whose effect
    Holds such an enmity with blood of man
    That swift as quicksilver it cou
rses through
    The natural gates and alleys of the body,
    And with a sudden vigour it doth po
sset
    And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
    The thin and wholesome blood. So did it min
e;
    And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
    Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust

    All my smooth body.
    Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
    Of life, of crown, of q
ueen, at once dispatch'd;
    Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
    Unhous'led, disappointed
, unanel'd,
    No reckoning made, but sent to my account
    With all my imperfections on my head
.
  Ham. O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
  Ghost. If thou hast nature in thee, bear it no
t.
    Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
    A couch for luxury and damned incest.
    But, how
soever thou pursuest this act,
    Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
    Against thy m
other aught. Leave her to heaven,
    And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge
    To prick and
 sting her. Fare thee well at once.
    The glowworm shows the matin to be near
    And gins to pa
le his uneffectual fire.
    Adieu, adieu, adieu! Remember me.                      Exit.

  Ham.
 O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?
    And shall I couple hell? Hold, hold, my heart!

    And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
    But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?
    Ay, t
hou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
    In this distracted globe. Remember thee?
    Yea, fr
om the table of my memory
    I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
    All saws of books, all 
forms, all pressures past
    That youth and observation copied there,
    And thy commandment all
 alone shall live
    Within the book and volume of my brain,
    Unmix'd with baser matter. Yes, 
by heaven!
    O most pernicious woman!
    O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
    My t
ables! Meet it is I set it down
    That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
    At least 
I am sure it may be so in Denmark.        [Writes.]
    So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word:

    It is 'Adieu, adieu! Remember me.'
    I have sworn't.
  Hor. (within) My lord, my lord!

  
                 Enter Horatio and Marcellus.

  Mar. Lord Hamlet!
  Hor. Heaven secure him!
  H
am. So be it!
  Mar. Illo, ho, ho, my lord!
  Ham. Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.
  Mar. H
ow is't, my noble lord?
  Hor. What news, my lord?
  Mar. O, wonderful!
  Hor. Good my lord, tell
 it.
  Ham. No, you will reveal it.
  Hor. Not I, my lord, by heaven!
  Mar. Nor I, my lord.
  H
am. How say you then? Would heart of man once think it?
    But you'll be secret?
  Both. Ay, by h
eaven, my lord.
  Ham. There's neer a villain dwelling in all Denmark
    But he's an arrant knave
.
  Hor. There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
    To tell us this.
  Ham. Why, righ
t! You are in the right!
    And so, without more circumstance at all,
    I hold it fit that we s
hake hands and part;
    You, as your business and desires shall point you,
    For every man hath
 business and desire,
    Such as it is; and for my own poor part,
    Look you, I'll go pray.
  
Hor. These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
  Ham. I am sorry they offend you, heartily;

    Yes, faith, heartily.
  Hor. There's no offence, my lord.
  Ham. Yes, by Saint Patrick, but th
ere is, Horatio,
    And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
    It is an honest ghost, t
hat let me tell you.
    For your desire to know what is between us,
    O'ermaster't as you may. 
And now, good friends,
    As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,
    Give me one poor reques
t.
  Hor. What is't, my lord? We will.
  Ham. Never make known what you have seen to-night.
  Bot
h. My lord, we will not.
  Ham. Nay, but swear't.
  Hor. In faith,
    My lord, not I.
  Mar. No
r I, my lord- in faith.
  Ham. Upon my sword.
  Mar. We have sworn, my lord, already.
  Ham. Inde
ed, upon my sword, indeed.

                 Ghost cries under the stage.

  Ghost. Swear.
  Ha
m. Aha boy, say'st thou so? Art thou there, truepenny?
    Come on! You hear this fellow in the cel
larage.
    Consent to swear.
  Hor. Propose the oath, my lord.
  Ham. Never to speak of this tha
t you have seen.
    Swear by my sword.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
  Ham. Hic et ubique? Then we'l
l shift our ground.
    Come hither, gentlemen,
    And lay your hands again upon my sword.
    N
ever to speak of this that you have heard:
    Swear by my sword.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear by his 
sword.
  Ham. Well said, old mole! Canst work i' th' earth so fast?
    A worthy pioner! Once more
 remove, good friends."
  Hor. O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
  Ham. And therefore
 as a stranger give it welcome.
    There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
    Than a
re dreamt of in your philosophy.
    But come!
    Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
   
 How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself
    (As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
    To put
 an antic disposition on),
    That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
    With arms encum
b'red thus, or this head-shake,
    Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
    As 'Well, well,
 we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'
    Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they mi
ght,'
    Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
    That you know aught of me- this is not to do,

    So grace and mercy at your most need help you,
    Swear.
  Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
        
                                           [They swear.]
  Ham. Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! So, g
entlemen,
    With all my love I do commend me to you;
    And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
  
  May do t' express his love and friending to you,
    God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in to
gether;
    And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
    The time is out of joint. O cursed sp
ite
    That ever I was born to set it right!
    Nay, come, let's go together.
                 
                                        Exeunt.

Act II. Scene I.
Elsinore. A r
oom in the house of Polonius.

Enter Polonius and Reynaldo.

  Pol. Give him this money and thes
e notes, Reynaldo.
  Rey. I will, my lord.
  Pol. You shall do marvell's wisely, good Reynaldo,
 
   Before You visit him, to make inquire
    Of his behaviour.
  Rey. My lord, I did intend it.
 
 Pol. Marry, well said, very well said. Look you, sir,
    Enquire me first what Danskers are in Pa
ris;
    And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
    What company, at what expense; and
 finding
    By this encompassment and drift of question
    That they do know my son, come you mo
re nearer
    Than your particular demands will touch it.
    Take you, as 'twere, some distant kn
owledge of him;
    As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
    And in part him.' Do you mark
 this, Reynaldo?
  Rey. Ay, very well, my lord.
  Pol. 'And in part him, but,' you may say, 'not w
ell.
    But if't be he I mean, he's very wild
    Addicted so and so'; and there put on him
    
What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
    As may dishonour him- take heed of that;
    Bu
t, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips
    As are companions noted and most known
    To youth
 and liberty.
  Rey. As gaming, my lord.
  Pol. Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,

    Drabbing. You may go so far.
  Rey. My lord, that would dishonour him.
  Pol. Faith, no, as yo
u may season it in the charge.
    You must not put another scandal on him,
    That he is open to
 incontinency.
    That's not my meaning. But breathe his faults so quaintly
    That they may see
m the taints of liberty,
    The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
    A savageness in unreclaim
ed blood,
    Of general assault.
  Rey. But, my good lord-
  Pol. Wherefore should you do this?

  Rey. Ay, my lord,
    I would know that.
  Pol. Marry, sir, here's my drift,
    And I believe
 it is a fetch of warrant.
    You laying these slight sullies on my son
    As 'twere a thing a l
ittle soil'd i' th' working,
    Mark you,
    Your party in converse, him you would sound,
    H
aving ever seen in the prenominate crimes
    The youth you breathe of guilty, be assur'd
    He c
loses with you in this consequence:
    'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman'-
    Accord
ing to the phrase or the addition
    Of man and country-
  Rey. Very good, my lord.
  Pol. And t
hen, sir, does 'a this- 'a does- What was I about to
say?
    By the mass, I was about to say some
thing! Where did I leave?
  Rey. At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,' and
    gentle
man.'
  Pol. At 'closes in the consequence'- Ay, marry!
    He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman.

    I saw him yesterday, or t'other day,
    Or then, or then, with such or such; and, as you say
,
    There was 'a gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
    There falling out at tennis'; or perchan
ce,
    'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'
    Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
    See yo
u now-
    Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth;
    And thus do we of wisdom and of re
ach,
    With windlasses and with assays of bias,
    By indirections find directions out.
    So
, by my former lecture and advice,
    Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?
  Rey. My lord
, I have.
  Pol. God b' wi' ye, fare ye well!
  Rey. Good my lord!                                
    [Going.]
  Pol. Observe his inclination in yourself.
  Rey. I shall, my lord.
  Pol. And let 
him ply his music.
  Rey. Well, my lord.
  Pol. Farewell!
                                       
           Exit Reynaldo.

                       Enter Ophelia.

    How now, Ophelia? What's t
he matter?
  Oph. O my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
  Pol. With what, i' th' name of 
God?
  Oph. My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
    Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac'd,

    No hat upon his head, his stockings foul'd,
    Ungart'red, and down-gyved to his ankle;
   
 Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,
    And with a look so piteous in purport
    A
s if he had been loosed out of hell
    To speak of horrors- he comes before me.
  Pol. Mad for th
y love?
  Oph. My lord, I do not know,
    But truly I do fear it.
  Pol. What said he?
  Oph. H
e took me by the wrist and held me hard;
    Then goes he to the length of all his arm,
    And, w
ith his other hand thus o'er his brow,
    He falls to such perusal of my face
    As he would dra
w it. Long stay'd he so.
    At last, a little shaking of mine arm,
    And thrice his head thus w
aving up and down,
    He rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound
    As it did seem to shatter all 
his bulk
    And end his being. That done, he lets me go,
    And with his head over his shoulder 
turn'd
    He seem'd to find his way without his eyes,
    For out o' doors he went without their 
help
    And to the last bended their light on me.
  Pol. Come, go with me. I will go seek the Kin
g.
    This is the very ecstasy of love,
    Whose violent property fordoes itself
    And leads 
the will to desperate undertakings
    As oft as any passion under heaven
    That does afflict ou
r natures. I am sorry.
    What, have you given him any hard words of late?
  Oph. No, my good lor
d; but, as you did command,
    I did repel his letters and denied
    His access to me.
  Pol. T
hat hath made him mad.
    I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
    I had not quoted him.
 I fear'd he did but trifle
    And meant to wrack thee; but beshrew my jealousy!
    By heaven, i
t is as proper to our age
    To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
    As it is common for the
 younger sort
    To lack discretion. Come, go we to the King.
    This must be known; which, bein
g kept close, might move
    More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
    Come.
              
                                           Exeunt.

Scene II.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.


Flourish. [Enter King and Queen, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern,
cum aliis.

  King. Welcome, dear 
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
    Moreover that we much did long to see you,
    The need we have 
to use you did provoke
    Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
    Of Hamlet's transformat
ion. So I call it,
    Sith nor th' exterior nor the inward man
    Resembles that it was. What it
 should be,
    More than his father's death, that thus hath put him
    So much from th' understa
nding of himself,
    I cannot dream of. I entreat you both
    That, being of so young days broug
ht up with him,
    And since so neighbour'd to his youth and haviour,
    That you vouchsafe your
 rest here in our court
    Some little time; so by your companies
    To draw him on to pleasures
, and to gather
    So much as from occasion you may glean,
    Whether aught to us unknown afflic
ts him thus
    That, open'd, lies within our remedy.
  Queen. Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd
 of you,
    And sure I am two men there are not living
    To whom he more adheres. If it will pl
ease you
    To show us so much gentry and good will
    As to expend your time with us awhile
  
  For the supply and profit of our hope,
    Your visitation shall receive such thanks
    As fits
 a king's remembrance.
  Ros. Both your Majesties
    Might, by the sovereign power you have of us
,
    Put your dread pleasures more into command
    Than to entreaty.
  Guil. But we both obey,

    And here give up ourselves, in the full bent,
    To lay our service freely at your feet,
   
 To be commanded.
  King. Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
  Queen. Thanks, Guildenste
rn and gentle Rosencrantz.
    And I beseech you instantly to visit
    My too much changed son.- 
Go, some of you,
    And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
  Guil. Heavens make our presence 
and our practices
    Pleasant and helpful to him!
  Queen. Ay, amen!
                 Exeunt Ros
encrantz and Guildenstern, [with some
                                                    Attendant
s].

                         Enter Polonius.

  Pol. Th' ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,

    Are joyfully return'd.
  King. Thou still hast been the father of good news.
  Pol. Have I, 
my lord? Assure you, my good liege,
    I hold my duty as I hold my soul,
    Both to my God and t
o my gracious king;
    And I do think- or else this brain of mine
    Hunts not the trail of poli
cy so sure
    As it hath us'd to do- that I have found
    The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
  
King. O, speak of that! That do I long to hear.
  Pol. Give first admittance to th' ambassadors.
 
   My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
  King. Thyself do grace to them, and bring them
 in.
                                                [Exit Polonius.]
    He tells me, my dear Ger
trude, he hath found
    The head and source of all your son's distemper.
  Queen. I doubt it is n
o other but the main,
    His father's death and our o'erhasty marriage.
  King. Well, we shall si
ft him.

              Enter Polonius, Voltemand, and Cornelius.

    Welcome, my good friends.

    Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?
  Volt. Most fair return of greetings and desire
s.
    Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
    His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
   
 To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack,
    But better look'd into, he truly found
    It was aga
inst your Highness; whereat griev'd,
    That so his sickness, age, and impotence
    Was falsely 
borne in hand, sends out arrests
    On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys,
    Receives rebuke
 from Norway, and, in fine,
    Makes vow before his uncle never more
    To give th' assay of arm
s against your Majesty.
    Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
    Gives him three thousand cr
owns in annual fee
    And his commission to employ those soldiers,
    So levied as before, again
st the Polack;
    With an entreaty, herein further shown,
                                       
         [Gives a paper.]
    That it might please you to give quiet pass
    Through your dominio
ns for this enterprise,
    On such regards of safety and allowance
    As therein are set down.

  King. It likes us well;
    And at our more consider'd time we'll read,
    Answer, and think up
on this business.
    Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour.
    Go to your rest; at nig
ht we'll feast together.
    Most welcome home!                       Exeunt Ambassadors.
  Pol. T
his business is well ended.
    My liege, and madam, to expostulate
    What majesty should be, wh
at duty is,
    Why day is day, night is night, and time is time.
    Were nothing but to waste ni
ght, day, and time.
    Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
    And tediousness the limbs
 and outward flourishes,
    I will be brief. Your noble son is mad.
    Mad call I it; for, to de
fine true madness,
    What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
    But let that go.
  Queen. Mo
re matter, with less art.
  Pol. Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
    That he is mad, 'tis true
: 'tis true 'tis pity;
    And pity 'tis 'tis true. A foolish figure!
    But farewell it, for I w
ill use no art.
    Mad let us grant him then. And now remains
    That we find out the cause of t
his effect-
    Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
    For this effect defective comes by ca
use.
    Thus it remains, and the remainder thus.
    Perpend.
    I have a daughter (have while 
she is mine),
    Who in her duty and obedience, mark,
    Hath given me this. Now gather, and sur
mise.
                                             [Reads] the letter.
    'To the celestial, and 
my soul's idol, the most beautified
      Ophelia,'-

    That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'b
eautified' is a vile
      phrase.
    But you shall hear. Thus:
                                
                        [Reads.]
    'In her excellent white bosom, these, &c.'
  Queen. Came this
 from Hamlet to her?
  Pol. Good madam, stay awhile. I will be faithful.     [Reads.]


        
  'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
            Doubt that the sun doth move;
          Doubt truth 
to be a liar;
            But never doubt I love.
      'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers
; I have not art
to
    reckon my groans; but that I love thee best, O most best,
believe
    it
. Adieu.
      'Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to
him,

HAMLET.'

    
This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me;
    And more above, hath his solicitings,
    As th
ey fell out by time, by means, and place,
    All given to mine ear.
  King. But how hath she
   
 Receiv'd his love?
  Pol. What do you think of me?
  King. As of a man faithful and honourable.

  Pol. I would fain prove so. But what might you think,
    When I had seen this hot love on the wi
ng
    (As I perceiv'd it, I must tell you that,
    Before my daughter told me), what might you,

    Or my dear Majesty your queen here, think,
    If I had play'd the desk or table book,
    Or
 given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
    Or look'd upon this love with idle sight?
    What m
ight you think? No, I went round to work
    And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
    'Lord H
amlet is a prince, out of thy star.
    This must not be.' And then I prescripts gave her,
    Tha
t she should lock herself from his resort,
    Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
    Which d
one, she took the fruits of my advice,
    And he, repulsed, a short tale to make,
    Fell into a
 sadness, then into a fast,
    Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
    Thence to a lightne
ss, and, by this declension,
    Into the madness wherein now he raves,
    And all we mourn for.

  King. Do you think 'tis this?
  Queen. it may be, very like.
  Pol. Hath there been such a time
- I would fain know that-
    That I have Positively said ''Tis so,'
    When it prov'd otherwise.
?
  King. Not that I know.
  Pol. [points to his head and shoulder] Take this from this, if
this

      be otherwise.
    If circumstances lead me, I will find
    Where truth is hid, though it w
ere hid indeed
    Within the centre.
  King. How may we try it further?
  Pol. You know sometime
s he walks for hours together
    Here in the lobby.
  Queen. So he does indeed.
  Pol. At such a
 time I'll loose my daughter to him.
    Be you and I behind an arras then.
    Mark the encounter
. If he love her not,
    And he not from his reason fall'n thereon
    Let me be no assistant for
 a state,
    But keep a farm and carters.
  King. We will try it.

                 Enter Hamle
t, reading on a book.

  Queen. But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
  Pol. Away, 
I do beseech you, both away
    I'll board him presently. O, give me leave.
                      
 Exeunt King and Queen, [with Attendants].
    How does my good Lord Hamlet?
  Ham. Well, God-a-me
rcy.
  Pol. Do you know me, my lord?
  Ham. Excellent well. You are a fishmonger.
  Pol. Not I, m
y lord.
  Ham. Then I would you were so honest a man.
  Pol. Honest, my lord?
  Ham. Ay, sir. To 
be honest, as this world goes, is to be one
man
    pick'd out of ten thousand.
  Pol. That's ver
y true, my lord.
  Ham. For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god
    kissing carrio
n- Have you a daughter?
  Pol. I have, my lord.
  Ham. Let her not walk i' th' sun. Conception is 
a blessing, but
not
    as your daughter may conceive. Friend, look to't.
  Pol. [aside] How say 
you by that? Still harping on my daughter.
Yet
    he knew me not at first. He said I was a fishmo
nger. He is
far
    gone, far gone! And truly in my youth I suff'red much
extremity
    for love
- very near this. I'll speak to him again.- What do
you
    read, my lord?
  Ham. Words, words, w
ords.
  Pol. What is the matter, my lord?
  Ham. Between who?
  Pol. I mean, the matter that you 
read, my lord.
  Ham. Slanders, sir; for the satirical rogue says here that old
men
    have grey
 beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes
    purging thick amber and plum-tree gum; and t
hat they have a
    plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams. All
which,
    sir, thou
gh I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I
hold it
    not honesty to have it thus set down;
 for you yourself, sir,
    should be old as I am if, like a crab, you could go backward.

  Pol.
 [aside] Though this be madness, yet there is a method
in't.-
   Will You walk out of the air, my 
lord?
  Ham. Into my grave?
  Pol. Indeed, that is out o' th' air. [Aside] How pregnant
sometimes

    his replies are! a happiness that often madness hits on,
which
    reason and sanity could n
ot so prosperously be delivered of.
I
    will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meetin
g
between
    him and my daughter.- My honourable lord, I will most humbly
take
    my leave of 
you.
  Ham. You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more
    willingly part withal- exc
ept my life, except my life, except
my
    life,

                    Enter Rosencrantz and Guil
denstern.

  Pol. Fare you well, my lord.
  Ham. These tedious old fools!
  Pol. You go to seek 
the Lord Hamlet. There he is.
  Ros. [to Polonius] God save you, sir!
                            
                    Exit [Polonius].

  Guil. My honour'd lord!
  Ros. My most dear lord!
  Ham.
 My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern?
Ah,
    Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye
 both?
  Ros. As the indifferent children of the earth.
  Guil. Happy in that we are not over-happ
y.
    On Fortune's cap we are not the very button.
  Ham. Nor the soles of her shoe?
  Ros. Neit
her, my lord.
  Ham. Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her
    favours?
  Guil. 
Faith, her privates we.
  Ham. In the secret parts of Fortune? O! most true! she is a
    strumpet
. What news ?
  Ros. None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
  Ham. Then is doomsday nea
r! But your news is not true. Let me
    question more in particular. What have you, my good friend
s,
    deserved at the hands of Fortune that she sends you to prison
    hither?
  Guil. Prison, 
my lord?
  Ham. Denmark's a prison.
  Ros. Then is the world one.
  Ham. A goodly one; in which t
here are many confines, wards, and
    dungeons, Denmark being one o' th' worst.
  Ros. We think n
ot so, my lord.
  Ham. Why, then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either
good
    or bad bu
t thinking makes it so. To me it is a prison.
  Ros. Why, then your ambition makes it one. 'Tis too
 narrow for
your
    mind.
  Ham. O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a
   
 king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.
  Guil. Which dreams indeed are ambiti
on; for the very substance
of
    the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
  Ham. A dream i
tself is but a shadow.
  Ros. Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality
that
    
it is but a shadow's shadow.
  Ham. Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and
outstretch'd

    heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we to th' court? for, by
my
    fay, I cannot reason.
  
Both. We'll wait upon you.
  Ham. No such matter! I will not sort you with the rest of my
    serv
ants; for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most
    dreadfully attended. But in the beaten
 way of friendship,
what
    make you at Elsinore?
  Ros. To visit you, my lord; no other occasio
n.
  Ham. Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank
you;
    and sure, dear friends
, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny.
Were
    you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a
 free
    visitation? Come, deal justly with me. Come, come! Nay,
speak.
  Guil. What should we s
ay, my lord?
  Ham. Why, anything- but to th' purpose. You were sent for; and
    there is a kind 
of confession in your looks, which your
modesties
    have not craft enough to colour. I know the 
good King and
Queen
    have sent for you.
  Ros. To what end, my lord?
  Ham. That you must tea
ch me. But let me conjure you by the
rights
    of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth,
 by the
    obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear
a
    better proposer co
uld charge you withal, be even and direct
with
    me, whether you were sent for or no.
  Ros. [a
side to Guildenstern] What say you?
  Ham. [aside] Nay then, I have an eye of you.- If you love me,

hold
    not off.
  Guil. My lord, we were sent for.
  Ham. I will tell you why. So shall my an
ticipation prevent your
    discovery, and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no
    feather
. I have of late- but wherefore I know not- lost all
my
    mirth, forgone all custom of exercises
; and indeed, it goes
so
    heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the
earth,
    
seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy,
the
    air, look you, this brave o'
erhanging firmament, this
majestical
    roof fretted with golden fire- why, it appeareth no other

thing
    to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What
a
    piece of work is 
a man! how noble in reason! how infinite in
    faculties! in form and moving how express and admir
able! in
    action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the
    beauty of the world
, the paragon of animals! And yet to me
what
    is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me
- no, nor
woman
    neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.
  Ros. My lord, there was
 no such stuff in my thoughts.
  Ham. Why did you laugh then, when I said 'Man delights not me'?
 
 Ros. To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten
    entertainment the players shall
 receive from you. We coted
them
    on the way, and hither are they coming to offer you service.

  Ham. He that plays the king shall be welcome- his Majesty shall
    have tribute of me; the adve
nturous knight shall use his foil
and
    target; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humorous ma
n
shall
    end his part in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose
    lungs are tickle o'
 th' sere; and the lady shall say her mind
    freely, or the blank verse shall halt for't. What pl
ayers are
    they?
  Ros. Even those you were wont to take such delight in, the
    tragedians o
f the city.
  Ham. How chances it they travel? Their residence, both in
    reputation and profit,
 was better both ways.
  Ros. I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late
    innovati
on.
  Ham. Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in
the
    city? Are they so foll
ow'd?
  Ros. No indeed are they not.
  Ham. How comes it? Do they grow rusty?
  Ros. Nay, their e
ndeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there
is,
    sir, an eyrie of children, little eyases, tha
t cry out on the
top
    of question and are most tyrannically clapp'd for't. These
are now
    
the fashion, and so berattle the common stages (so they call
    them) that many wearing rapiers ar
e afraid of goosequills and
    dare scarce come thither.
  Ham. What, are they children? Who main
tains 'em? How are they
    escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can
    sing
? Will they not say afterwards, if they should grow
    themselves to common players (as it is most
 like, if their
means
    are no better), their writers do them wrong to make them
exclaim
    a
gainst their own succession.
  Ros. Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the
nation

    holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy. There was, for
a
    while, no money bid for a
rgument unless the poet and the
player
    went to cuffs in the question.
  Ham. Is't possible?

  Guil. O, there has been much throwing about of brains.
  Ham. Do the boys carry it away?
  Ros. 
Ay, that they do, my lord- Hercules and his load too.
  Ham. It is not very strange; for my uncle i
s King of Denmark,
and
    those that would make mows at him while my father lived give
    twent
y, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his picture
in
    little. 'Sblood, there is somethin
g in this more than
natural, if
    philosophy could find it out.

                     Flourish
 for the Players.

  Guil. There are the players.
  Ham. Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. 
Your hands, come!
Th'
    appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me
comply
    wit
h you in this garb, lest my extent to the players (which I
    tell you must show fairly outwards) 
should more appear like
    entertainment than yours. You are welcome. But my
uncle-father
    an
d aunt-mother are deceiv'd.
  Guil. In what, my dear lord?
  Ham. I am but mad north-north-west. W
hen the wind is southerly
I
    know a hawk from a handsaw.

                            Enter P
olonius.

  Pol. Well be with you, gentlemen!
  Ham. Hark you, Guildenstern- and you too- at each
 ear a hearer!
    That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling
    clouts.
  Ro
s. Happily he's the second time come to them; for they say an
old
    man is twice a child.
  Ham
. I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players. Mark
it.-
   You say right, sir; a Monday mo
rning; twas so indeed.
  Pol. My lord, I have news to tell you.
  Ham. My lord, I have news to tel
l you. When Roscius was an
actor in
    Rome-
  Pol. The actors are come hither, my lord.
  Ham.
 Buzz, buzz!
  Pol. Upon my honour-
  Ham. Then came each actor on his ass-
  Pol. The best actor
s in the world, either for tragedy, comedy,
    history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pas
toral,
    tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral;
scene
    individable, or p
oem unlimited. Seneca cannot be too heavy,
nor
    Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the 
liberty, these
are
    the only men.
  Ham. O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst th
ou!
  Pol. What treasure had he, my lord?
  Ham. Why,

         'One fair daughter, and no more,

           The which he loved passing well.'

  Pol. [aside] Still on my daughter.
  Ham. Am I 
not i' th' right, old Jephthah?
  Pol. If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I

    love passing well.
  Ham. Nay, that follows not.
  Pol. What follows then, my lord?
  Ham. Wh
y,

           'As by lot, God wot,'

 and then, you know,

           'It came to pass, as mo
st like it was.'

    The first row of the pious chanson will show you more; for
look
    where 
my abridgment comes.

                     Enter four or five Players.

    You are welcome, mas
ters; welcome, all.- I am glad to see
thee
    well.- Welcome, good friends.- O, my old friend? Wh
y, thy
face is
    valanc'd since I saw thee last. Com'st' thou to' beard me in
    Denmark?- Wha
t, my young lady and mistress? By'r Lady, your
    ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you
 last by the
    altitude of a chopine. Pray God your voice, like a piece of
    uncurrent gold, b
e not crack'd within the ring.- Masters, you
are
    all welcome. We'll e'en to't like French falc
oners, fly at
    anything we see. We'll have a speech straight. Come, give us
a
    taste of you
r quality. Come, a passionate speech.
  1. Play. What speech, my good lord?
  Ham. I heard thee sp
eak me a speech once, but it was never
acted;
    or if it was, not above once; for the play, I re
member,
pleas'd
    not the million, 'twas caviary to the general; but it was (as
I
    receiv'd
 it, and others, whose judgments in such matters
cried in
    the top of mine) an excellent play, 
well digested in the
scenes,
    set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember one said
  
  there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter
savoury,
    nor no matter in the phrase t
hat might indict the author of
    affectation; but call'd it an honest method, as wholesome as
  
  sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech
in't
    I chiefly lov'd. 'Twas AEne
as' tale to Dido, and thereabout
of it
    especially where he speaks of Priam's slaughter. If it 
live
in
    your memory, begin at this line- let me see, let me see:

         'The rugged Pyrrh
us, like th' Hyrcanian beast-'

    'Tis not so; it begins with Pyrrhus:

         'The rugged P
yrrhus, he whose sable arms,
         Black as his purpose, did the night resemble
         When h
e lay couched in the ominous horse,
         Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd
    
     With heraldry more dismal. Head to foot
         Now is be total gules, horridly trick'd
    
     With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
         Bak'd and impasted with the parching
 streets,
         That lend a tyrannous and a damned light
         To their lord's murther. Roas
ted in wrath and fire,
         And thus o'ersized with coagulate gore,
         With eyes like ca
rbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
         Old grandsire Priam seeks.'

    So, proceed you.
  Pol. 
Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good
     discretion.

  1. Play. 'Anon he f
inds him,
      Striking too short at Greeks. His antique sword,
      Rebellious to his arm, lies
 where it falls,
      Repugnant to command. Unequal match'd,
      Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in ra
ge strikes wide;
      But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
      Th' unnerved father fal
ls. Then senseless Ilium,
      Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
      Stoops to his ba
se, and with a hideous crash
      Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear. For lo! his sword,
      Which was
 declining on the milky head
      Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' th' air to stick.
      So, as a p
ainted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
      And, like a neutral to his will and matter,
      Did nothing.

      But, as we often see, against some storm,
      A silence in the heavens, the rack stand st
ill,
      The bold winds speechless, and the orb below
      As hush as death- anon the dreadful 
thunder
      Doth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
      Aroused vengeance sets him new
 awork;
      And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
      On Mars's armour, forg'd for proof ete
rne,
      With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
      Now falls on Priam.
      Out, ou
t, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods,
      In general synod take away her power;
      Break al
l the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
      And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
  
    As low as to the fiends!

  Pol. This is too long.
  Ham. It shall to the barber's, with your
 beard.- Prithee say
on.
    He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps. Say on;
come to
 
   Hecuba.

  1. Play. 'But who, O who, had seen the mobled queen-'

  Ham. 'The mobled queen'?

  Pol. That's good! 'Mobled queen' is good.

  1. Play. 'Run barefoot up and down, threat'ning th
e flames
      With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head
      Where late the diadem stood, and fo
r a robe,
      About her lank and all o'erteemed loins,
      A blanket, in the alarm of fear cau
ght up-
      Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd
      'Gainst Fortune's state would 
treason have pronounc'd.
      But if the gods themselves did see her then,
      When she saw Pyr
rhus make malicious sport
      In Mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,
      The instant b
urst of clamour that she made
      (Unless things mortal move them not at all)
      Would have m
ade milch the burning eyes of heaven
      And passion in the gods.'

  Pol. Look, whe'r he has n
ot turn'd his colour, and has tears
in's
    eyes. Prithee no more!
  Ham. 'Tis well. I'll have t
hee speak out the rest of this
soon.-
    Good my lord, will you see the players well bestow'd? Do
 you
    hear? Let them be well us'd; for they are the abstract and
brief
    chronicles of the t
ime. After your death you were better have
a
    bad epitaph than their ill report while you live.

  Pol. My lord, I will use them according to their desert.
  Ham. God's bodykins, man, much bette
r! Use every man after his
    desert, and who should scape whipping? Use them after your
own
   
 honour and dignity. The less they deserve, the more merit is
in
    your bounty. Take them in.
 
 Pol. Come, sirs.
  Ham. Follow him, friends. We'll hear a play to-morrow.
                 Exeunt
 Polonius and Players [except the First].
    Dost thou hear me, old friend? Can you play 'The Murt
her of
    Gonzago'?
  1. Play. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a 
need, study a
    speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which I would set down
and
    insert in'
t, could you not?
  1. Play. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Very well. Follow that lord- and look you mock hi
m not.
                                            [Exit First Player.]
    My good friends, I'll 
leave you till night. You are welcome
to
    Elsinore.
  Ros. Good my lord!
  Ham. Ay, so, God b
' wi' ye!
                            [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
    Now I am alone.
  
  O what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
    Is it not monstrous that this player here,
    But in
 a fiction, in a dream of passion,
    Could force his soul so to his own conceit
    That, from h
er working, all his visage wann'd,
    Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
    A broken vo
ice, and his whole function suiting
    With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!
    For He
cuba!
    What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
    That he should weep for her? What would he do
,
    Had he the motive and the cue for passion
    That I have? He would drown the stage with tea
rs
    And cleave the general ear with horrid speech;
    Make mad the guilty and appal the free,

    Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed
    The very faculties of eyes and ears.
    Yet I,

    A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak
    Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
    And 
can say nothing! No, not for a king,
    Upon whose property and most dear life
    A damn'd defea
t was made. Am I a coward?
    Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
    Plucks off my bear
d and blows it in my face?
    Tweaks me by th' nose? gives me the lie i' th' throat
    As deep a
s to the lungs? Who does me this, ha?
    'Swounds, I should take it! for it cannot be
    But I a
m pigeon-liver'd and lack gall
    To make oppression bitter, or ere this
    I should have fatted
 all the region kites
    With this slave's offal. Bloody bawdy villain!
    Remorseless, treacher
ous, lecherous, kindless villain!
    O, vengeance!
    Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,

    That I, the son of a dear father murther'd,
    Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
 
   Must (like a whore) unpack my heart with words
    And fall a-cursing like a very drab,
    A s
cullion!
    Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! Hum, I have heard
    That guilty creatures, sittin
g at a play,
    Have by the very cunning of the scene
    Been struck so to the soul that present
ly
    They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
    For murther, though it have no tongue, will sp
eak
    With most miraculous organ, I'll have these Players
    Play something like the murther of
 my father
    Before mine uncle. I'll observe his looks;
    I'll tent him to the quick. If he bu
t blench,
    I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
    May be a devil; and the devil hath
 power
    T' assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
    Out of my weakness and my melancholy,

    As he is very potent with such spirits,
    Abuses me to damn me. I'll have grounds
    More 
relative than this. The play's the thing
    Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King.        
 Exit.

ACT III. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King, Queen,
 Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern,
and Lords.

  King. And can you by no drift of cir
cumstance
    Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
    Grating so harshly all his days of q
uiet
    With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
  Ros. He does confess he feels himself distracted,

    But from what cause he will by no means speak.
  Guil. Nor do we find him forward to be sounde
d,
    But with a crafty madness keeps aloof
    When we would bring him on to some confession
  
  Of his true state.
  Queen. Did he receive you well?
  Ros. Most like a gentleman.
  Guil. But 
with much forcing of his disposition.
  Ros. Niggard of question, but of our demands
    Most free
 in his reply.
  Queen. Did you assay him
    To any pastime?
  Ros. Madam, it so fell out that c
ertain players
    We o'erraught on the way. Of these we told him,
    And there did seem in him a
 kind of joy
    To hear of it. They are here about the court,
    And, as I think, they have alre
ady order
    This night to play before him.
  Pol. 'Tis most true;
    And he beseech'd me to en
treat your Majesties
    To hear and see the matter.
  King. With all my heart, and it doth much c
ontent me
    To hear him so inclin'd.
    Good gentlemen, give him a further edge
    And drive 
his purpose on to these delights.
  Ros. We shall, my lord.
                            Exeunt Ros
encrantz and Guildenstern.
  King. Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
    For we have closely sent for 
Hamlet hither,
    That he, as 'twere by accident, may here
    Affront Ophelia.
    Her father a
nd myself (lawful espials)
    Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing unseen,
    We may of their e
ncounter frankly judge
    And gather by him, as he is behav'd,
    If't be th' affliction of his 
love, or no,
    That thus he suffers for.
  Queen. I shall obey you;
    And for your part, Ophe
lia, I do wish
    That your good beauties be the happy cause
    Of Hamlet's wildness. So shall I
 hope your virtues
    Will bring him to his wonted way again,
    To both your honours.
  Oph. M
adam, I wish it may.
                                                   [Exit Queen.]
  Pol. Ophel
ia, walk you here.- Gracious, so please you,
    We will bestow ourselves.- [To Ophelia] Read on th
is book,
    That show of such an exercise may colour
    Your loneliness.- We are oft to blame in
 this,
    'Tis too much prov'd, that with devotion's visage
    And pious action we do sugar o'er

    The Devil himself.
  King. [aside] O, 'tis too true!
    How smart a lash that speech doth g
ive my conscience!
    The harlot's cheek, beautied with plast'ring art,
    Is not more ugly to t
he thing that helps it
    Than is my deed to my most painted word.
    O heavy burthen!
  Pol. I
 hear him coming. Let's withdraw, my lord.
                                      Exeunt King and Po
lonius].

                           Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. To be, or not to be- that is the ques
tion:
    Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
    The slings and arrows of outrageous fortun
e
    Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
    And by opposing end them. To die- to sleep-

    No more; and by a sleep to say we end
    The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks
    T
hat flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation
    Devoutly to be wish'd. To die- to sleep.
    To slee
p- perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub!
    For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
  
  When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
    Must give us pause. There's the respect
    That
 makes calamity of so long life.
    For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
    Th' oppr
essor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
    The pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay,
    The
 insolence of office, and the spurns
    That patient merit of th' unworthy takes,
    When he him
self might his quietus make
    With a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear,
    To grunt and
 sweat under a weary life,
    But that the dread of something after death-
    The undiscover'd c
ountry, from whose bourn
    No traveller returns- puzzles the will,
    And makes us rather bear 
those ills we have
    Than fly to others that we know not of?
    Thus conscience does make cowar
ds of us all,
    And thus the native hue of resolution
    Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of
 thought,
    And enterprises of great pith and moment
    With this regard their currents turn aw
ry
    And lose the name of action.- Soft you now!
    The fair Ophelia!- Nymph, in thy orisons
 
   Be all my sins rememb'red.
  Oph. Good my lord,
    How does your honour for this many a day?

  Ham. I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
  Oph. My lord, I have remembrances of yours
    That
 I have longed long to re-deliver.
    I pray you, now receive them.
  Ham. No, not I!
    I neve
r gave you aught.
  Oph. My honour'd lord, you know right well you did,
    And with them words of
 so sweet breath compos'd
    As made the things more rich. Their perfume lost,
    Take these aga
in; for to the noble mind
    Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
    There, my lord.
 
 Ham. Ha, ha! Are you honest?
  Oph. My lord?
  Ham. Are you fair?
  Oph. What means your lordshi
p?
  Ham. That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit
no
    discourse to your beau
ty.
  Oph. Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with
honesty?
  Ham. Ay, truly; for t
he power of beauty will sooner transform
    honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of ho
nesty
can
    translate beauty into his likeness. This was sometime a
paradox,
    but now the t
ime gives it proof. I did love you once.
  Oph. Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
  Ham. Yo
u should not have believ'd me; for virtue cannot so
    inoculate our old stock but we shall relish
 of it. I loved
you
    not.
  Oph. I was the more deceived.
  Ham. Get thee to a nunnery! Why w
ouldst thou be a breeder of
    sinners? I am myself indifferent honest, but yet I could
accuse
 
   me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne
me.
    I am very proud, revengef
ul, ambitious; with more offences at
my
    beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination 
to give
    them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows
as I
    do, crawling be
tween earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves
all;
    believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery
. Where's your
    father?
  Oph. At home, my lord.
  Ham. Let the doors be shut upon him, that h
e may play the fool
    nowhere but in's own house. Farewell.
  Oph. O, help him, you sweet heaven
s!
  Ham. If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy
dowry:
    be thou as chaste as 
ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not
escape
    calumny. Get thee to a nunnery. Go, farewell. Or i
f thou wilt
    needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what
    monsters you mak
e of them. To a nunnery, go; and quickly too.
    Farewell.
  Oph. O heavenly powers, restore him!

  Ham. I have heard of your paintings too, well enough. God hath
    given you one face, and you 
make yourselves another. You jig,
you
    amble, and you lisp; you nickname God's creatures and ma
ke
your
    wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't! it hath
made
    me mad. I say,
 we will have no more marriages. Those that are
    married already- all but one- shall live; the r
est shall keep
as
    they are. To a nunnery, go.                            Exit.
  Oph. O, what
 a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
    The courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword,
  
  Th' expectancy and rose of the fair state,
    The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
    T
h' observ'd of all observers- quite, quite down!
    And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
  
  That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
    Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
    L
ike sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
    That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth

    Blasted with ecstasy. O, woe is me
    T' have seen what I have seen, see what I see!

     
              Enter King and Polonius.

  King. Love? his affections do not that way tend;
    No
r what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,
    Was not like madness. There's something in his
 soul
    O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
    And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose

    Will be some danger; which for to prevent,
    I have in quick determination
    Thus set it d
own: he shall with speed to England
    For the demand of our neglected tribute.
    Haply the sea
s, and countries different,
    With variable objects, shall expel
    This something-settled matt
er in his heart,
    Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
    From fashion of himself. W
hat think you on't?
  Pol. It shall do well. But yet do I believe
    The origin and commencement 
of his grief
    Sprung from neglected love.- How now, Ophelia?
    You need not tell us what Lord
 Hamlet said.
    We heard it all.- My lord, do as you please;
    But if you hold it fit, after t
he play
    Let his queen mother all alone entreat him
    To show his grief. Let her be round wit
h him;
    And I'll be plac'd so please you, in the ear
    Of all their conference. If she find h
im not,
    To England send him; or confine him where
    Your wisdom best shall think.
  King. I
t shall be so.
    Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.         Exeunt.




Scene II.

Elsinore. hall in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet and three of the Players.

  Ham. Speak the speech,
 I pray you, as I pronounc'd it to you,
    trippingly on the tongue. But if you mouth it, as many 
of our
    players do, I had as live the town crier spoke my lines. Nor
do
    not saw the air to
o much with your hand, thus, but use all
    gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and (as I ma
y say)
    whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and beget a
    temperance that may give it
 smoothness. O, it offends me to
the
    soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a pas
sion
to
    tatters, to very rags, to split the cars of the groundlings,
who
    (for the most p
art) are capable of nothing but inexplicable
dumb
    shows and noise. I would have such a fellow 
whipp'd for
o'erdoing
    Termagant. It out-herods Herod. Pray you avoid it.
  Player. I warrant 
your honour.
  Ham. Be not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be
your
    tutor. Suit 
the action to the word, the word to the action;
with
    this special observance, that you o'erste
p not the modesty of
    nature: for anything so overdone is from the purpose of
playing,
    who
se end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as
    'twere, the mirror up to nature; to 
show Virtue her own
feature,
    scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time
his

    form and pressure. Now this overdone, or come tardy off,
though
    it make the unskilful laug
h, cannot but make the judicious
    grieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance
 
   o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that
I
    have seen play, and heard o
thers praise, and that highly (not
to
    speak it profanely), that, neither having the accent of

    Christians, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have
so
    strutted and bellowed that
 I have thought some of Nature's
    journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they
imitate
d
    humanity so abominably.
  Player. I hope we have reform'd that indifferently with us,
sir.

  Ham. O, reform it altogether! And let those that play your
clowns
    speak no more than is set
 down for them. For there be of them
    that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of bar
ren
    spectators to laugh too, though in the mean time some
necessary
    question of the play 
be then to be considered. That's
villanous
    and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that 
uses it.
Go
    make you ready.
                                                 Exeunt Players.


            Enter Polonius, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.

    How now, my lord? Will the King
 hear this piece of work?
  Pol. And the Queen too, and that presently.
  Ham. Bid the players mak
e haste, [Exit Polonius.] Will you two
    help to hasten them?
  Both. We will, my lord.         
              Exeunt they two.
  Ham. What, ho, Horatio!

                      Enter Horatio.


  Hor. Here, sweet lord, at your service.
  Ham. Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
    As e'er
 my conversation cop'd withal.
  Hor. O, my dear lord!
  Ham. Nay, do not think I flatter;
    Fo
r what advancement may I hope from thee,
    That no revenue hast but thy good spirits
    To feed
 and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
    No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp
,
    And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
    Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hea
r?
    Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
    And could of men distinguish, her electio
n
    Hath seal'd thee for herself. For thou hast been
    As one, in suff'ring all, that suffers 
nothing;
    A man that Fortune's buffets and rewards
    Hast ta'en with equal thanks; and blest 
are those
    Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled
    That they are not a pipe for For
tune's finger
    To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
    That is not passion's slave,
 and I will wear him
    In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
    As I do thee. Something
 too much of this I
    There is a play to-night before the King.
    One scene of it comes near t
he circumstance,
    Which I have told thee, of my father's death.
    I prithee, when thou seest 
that act afoot,
    Even with the very comment of thy soul
    Observe my uncle. If his occulted g
uilt
    Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
    It is a damned ghost that we have seen,
    An
d my imaginations are as foul
    As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
    For I mine eyes w
ill rivet to his face,
    And after we will both our judgments join
    In censure of his seeming
.
  Hor. Well, my lord.
    If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
    And scape dete
cting, I will pay the theft.

    Sound a flourish. [Enter Trumpets and Kettledrums. Danish
    m
arch. [Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz,
      Guildenstern, and other Lords atten
dant, with the Guard
                       carrying torches.

  Ham. They are coming to the play
. I must be idle.
    Get you a place.
  King. How fares our cousin Hamlet?
  Ham. Excellent, i' 
faith; of the chameleon's dish. I eat the
air,
    promise-cramm'd. You cannot feed capons so.
  
King. I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet. These words are
not
    mine.
  Ham. No, nor mine 
now. [To Polonius] My lord, you play'd once
    i' th' university, you say?
  Pol. That did I, my 
lord, and was accounted a good actor.
  Ham. What did you enact?
  Pol. I did enact Julius Caesar;
 I was kill'd i' th' Capitol;
Brutus
    kill'd me.
  Ham. It was a brute part of him to kill so 
capital a calf
there. Be
    the players ready.
  Ros. Ay, my lord. They stay upon your patience.

  Queen. Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
  Ham. No, good mother. Here's metal more attrac
tive.
  Pol. [to the King] O, ho! do you mark that?
  Ham. Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
       
                           [Sits down at Ophelia's feet.]

  Oph. No, my lord.
  Ham. I mean, my 
head upon your lap?
  Oph. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Do you think I meant country matters?
  Oph. I thi
nk nothing, my lord.
  Ham. That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
  Oph. What is, my l
ord?
  Ham. Nothing.
  Oph. You are merry, my lord.
  Ham. Who, I?
  Oph. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. O
 God, your only jig-maker! What should a man do but be
merry?
    For look you how cheerfully my m
other looks, and my father
died
    within 's two hours.
  Oph. Nay 'tis twice two months, my lor
d.
  Ham. So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I'll have
a
    suit of sables. O heav
ens! die two months ago, and not
forgotten
    yet? Then there's hope a great man's memory may out
live his
life
    half a year. But, by'r Lady, he must build churches then; or
else
    shall he
 suffer not thinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose

    epitaph is 'For O, for O, the hobby-hors
e is forgot!'

               Hautboys play. The dumb show enters.

    Enter a King and a Queen
 very lovingly; the Queen embracing
    him and he her. She kneels, and makes show of protestation

    unto him. He takes her up, and declines his head upon her
    neck. He lays him down upon a ba
nk of flowers. She, seeing
    him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his
    c
rown, kisses it, pours poison in the sleeper's ears, and
    leaves him. The Queen returns, finds t
he King dead, and makes
    passionate action. The Poisoner with some three or four
Mutes,
    co
mes in again, seem to condole with her. The dead body is
    carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Q
ueen with gifts; she
    seems harsh and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts
    his love.
 
                                                        Exeunt.

  Oph. What means this, my lord?

  Ham. Marry, this is miching malhecho; it means mischief.
  Oph. Belike this show imports the arg
ument of the play.

                      Enter Prologue.

  Ham. We shall know by this fellow. 
The players cannot keep
counsel;
    they'll tell all.
  Oph. Will he tell us what this show mean
t?
  Ham. Ay, or any show that you'll show him. Be not you asham'd
to
    show, he'll not shame t
o tell you what it means.
  Oph. You are naught, you are naught! I'll mark the play.

    Pro. Fo
r us, and for our tragedy,
      Here stooping to your clemency,
      We beg your hearing patient
ly.                     [Exit.]

  Ham. Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
  Oph. 'Tis br
ief, my lord.
  Ham. As woman's love.

              Enter [two Players as] King and Queen.

  
  King. Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round
      Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed
 ground,
      And thirty dozen moons with borrowed sheen
      About the world have times twelve 
thirties been,
      Since love our hearts, and Hymen did our hands,
      Unite comutual in most 
sacred bands.
    Queen. So many journeys may the sun and moon
      Make us again count o'er ere 
love be done!
      But woe is me! you are so sick of late,
      So far from cheer and from your 
former state.
      That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
      Discomfort you, my lord, it
 nothing must;
      For women's fear and love holds quantity,
      In neither aught, or in extre
mity.
      Now what my love is, proof hath made you know;
      And as my love is siz'd, my fear 
is so.
      Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
      Where little fears grow grea
t, great love grows there.
    King. Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;
      My ope
rant powers their functions leave to do.
      And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
    
  Honour'd, belov'd, and haply one as kind
      For husband shalt thou-
    Queen. O, confound th
e rest!
      Such love must needs be treason in my breast.
      When second husband let me be ac
curst!
      None wed the second but who killed the first.

  Ham. [aside] Wormwood, wormwood!


    Queen. The instances that second marriage move
      Are base respects of thrift, but none of 
love.
      A second time I kill my husband dead
      When second husband kisses me in bed.
    
King. I do believe you think what now you speak;
      But what we do determine oft we break.
    
  Purpose is but the slave to memory,
      Of violent birth, but poor validity;
      Which now, 
like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree,
      But fall unshaken when they mellow be.
      Most nec
essary 'tis that we forget
      To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt.
      What to ourselv
es in passion we propose,
      The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
      The violence of e
ither grief or joy
      Their own enactures with themselves destroy.
      Where joy most revels,
 grief doth most lament;
      Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
      This world is n
ot for aye, nor 'tis not strange
      That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
      
For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
      Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
 
     The great man down, you mark his favourite flies,
      The poor advanc'd makes friends of ene
mies;
      And hitherto doth love on fortune tend,
      For who not needs shall never lack a fri
end,
      And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
      Directly seasons him his enemy.
      
But, orderly to end where I begun,
      Our wills and fates do so contrary run
      That our dev
ices still are overthrown;
      Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own.
      So think
 thou wilt no second husband wed;
      But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
    Quee
n. Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light,
      Sport and repose lock from me day and night,

      To desperation turn my trust and hope,
      An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope,
     
 Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
      Meet what I would have well, and it destroy,
    
  Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
      If, once a widow, ever I be wife!

  Ham. I
f she should break it now!

    King. 'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile.
      My sp
irits grow dull, and fain I would beguile
      The tedious day with sleep.
    Queen. Sleep rock 
thy brain,
                                                    [He] sleeps.
      And never come m
ischance between us twain!
Exit.

  Ham. Madam, how like you this play?
  Queen. The lady doth p
rotest too much, methinks.
  Ham. O, but she'll keep her word.
  King. Have you heard the argument
? Is there no offence in't?
  Ham. No, no! They do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i'
th'
  
  world.
  King. What do you call the play?
  Ham. 'The Mousetrap.' Marry, how? Tropically. This p
lay is the
    image of a murther done in Vienna. Gonzago is the duke's
name;
    his wife, Bapti
sta. You shall see anon. 'Tis a knavish piece
of
    work; but what o' that? Your Majesty, and we 
that have free
    souls, it touches us not. Let the gall'd jade winch; our
withers
    are unwru
ng.

                         Enter Lucianus.

    This is one Lucianus, nephew to the King.
  
Oph. You are as good as a chorus, my lord.
  Ham. I could interpret between you and your love, if I
 could
see
    the puppets dallying.
  Oph. You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
  Ham. It would
 cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
  Oph. Still better, and worse.
  Ham. So you must take 
your husbands.- Begin, murtherer. Pox,
leave
    thy damnable faces, and begin! Come, the croaking
 raven doth
    bellow for revenge.

    Luc. Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agre
eing;
      Confederate season, else no creature seeing;
      Thou mixture rank, of midnight weed
s collected,
      With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,
      Thy natural magic and 
dire property
      On wholesome life usurp immediately.
                                   Pours 
the poison in his ears.

  Ham. He poisons him i' th' garden for's estate. His name's
Gonzago.
 
   The story is extant, and written in very choice Italian. You
    shall see anon how the murthere
r gets the love of Gonzago's
wife.
  Oph. The King rises.
  Ham. What, frighted with false fire?

  Queen. How fares my lord?
  Pol. Give o'er the play.
  King. Give me some light! Away!
  All. 
Lights, lights, lights!
                              Exeunt all but Hamlet and Horatio.
  Ham.   
Why, let the strucken deer go weep,
          The hart ungalled play;
         For some must watch
, while some must sleep:
          Thus runs the world away.
    Would not this, sir, and a forest
 of feathers- if the rest of
my
    fortunes turn Turk with me-with two Provincial roses on my
ra
z'd
    shoes, get me a fellowship in a cry of players, sir?
  Hor. Half a share.
  Ham.   A whol
e one I!
         For thou dost know, O Damon dear,
           This realm dismantled was
        
 Of Jove himself; and now reigns here
           A very, very- pajock.
  Hor. You might have rhym'
d.
  Ham. O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand
    pound! Didst perceive?
  
Hor. Very well, my lord.
  Ham. Upon the talk of the poisoning?
  Hor. I did very well note him.

  Ham.   Aha! Come, some music! Come, the recorders!
         For if the King like not the comedy,

         Why then, belike he likes it not, perdy.
    Come, some music!

                Enter R
osencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Guil. Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.
  Ham. Sir, a w
hole history.
  Guil. The King, sir-
  Ham. Ay, sir, what of him?
  Guil. Is in his retirement, m
arvellous distemper'd.
  Ham. With drink, sir?
  Guil. No, my lord; rather with choler.
  Ham. Yo
ur wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this
to
    the doctor; for me to put him to h
is purgation would perhaps
    plunge him into far more choler.
  Guil. Good my lord, put your dis
course into some frame, and
start
    not so wildly from my affair.
  Ham. I am tame, sir; pronou
nce.
  Guil. The Queen, your mother, in most great affliction of
spirit
    hath sent me to you.

  Ham. You are welcome.
  Guil. Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right
breed.
    
If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, I will
do
    your mother's commandment; if 
not, your pardon and my return
    shall be the end of my business.
  Ham. Sir, I cannot.
  Guil.
 What, my lord?
  Ham. Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseas'd. But, sir,
such
    answer 
as I can make, you shall command; or rather, as you
say,
    my mother. Therefore no more, but to 
the matter! My mother,
you
    say-
  Ros. Then thus she says: your behaviour hath struck her int
o
    amazement and admiration.
  Ham. O wonderful son, that can so stonish a mother! But is
ther
e no
    sequel at the heels of this mother's admiration? Impart.
  Ros. She desires to speak with
 you in her closet ere you go to
bed.
  Ham. We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have yo
u any
    further trade with us?
  Ros. My lord, you once did love me.
  Ham. And do still, by th
ese pickers and stealers!
  Ros. Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? You do
surely
   
 bar the door upon your own liberty, if you deny your griefs
to
    your friend.
  Ham. Sir, I la
ck advancement.
  Ros. How can that be, when you have the voice of the King
himself
    for your 
succession in Denmark?
  Ham. Ay, sir, but 'while the grass grows'- the proverb is
something
    
musty.

                     Enter the Players with recorders.

    O, the recorders! Let me see
 one. To withdraw with you- why
do
    you go about to recover the wind of me, as if you would dri
ve
me
    into a toil?
  Guil. O my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too
unmannerly.
  
Ham. I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this
pipe?
  Guil. My lord, I cannot.
  Ha
m. I pray you.
  Guil. Believe me, I cannot.
  Ham. I do beseech you.
  Guil. I know, no touch of
 it, my lord.
  Ham. It is as easy as lying. Govern these ventages with your
    fingers and thumb
s, give it breath with your mouth, and it
will
    discourse most eloquent music. Look you, these 
are the stops.
  Guil. But these cannot I command to any utt'rance of harmony. I
    have not the 
skill.
  Ham. Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me!
You
    would play upon me;
 you would seem to know my stops; you
would
    pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound
 me from my
    lowest note to the top of my compass; and there is much
music,
    excellent voic
e, in this little organ, yet cannot you make it
    speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am easier to be 
play'd on than
a
    pipe? Call me what instrument you will, though you can fret
me,
    you can
not play upon me.

                        Enter Polonius.

    God bless you, sir!
  Pol. My l
ord, the Queen would speak with you, and presently.
  Ham. Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in
 shape of a camel?
  Pol. By th' mass, and 'tis like a camel indeed.
  Ham. Methinks it is like a 
weasel.
  Pol. It is back'd like a weasel.
  Ham. Or like a whale.
  Pol. Very like a whale.
  H
am. Then will I come to my mother by-and-by.- They fool me to
the
    top of my bent.- I will come
 by-and-by.
  Pol. I will say so.                                      Exit.
  Ham. 'By-and-by' is
 easily said.- Leave me, friends.
                                        [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]


    'Tis now the very witching time of night,
    When churchyards yawn, and hell itself breathe
s out
    Contagion to this world. Now could I drink hot blood
    And do such bitter business as 
the day
    Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother!
    O heart, lose not thy nature; let 
not ever
    The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom.
    Let me be cruel, not unnatural;
    I wi
ll speak daggers to her, but use none.
    My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites-
    How in my
 words somever she be shent,
    To give them seals never, my soul, consent!             Exit.





Scene III.
A room in the Castle.

Enter King, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.

  King. I li
ke him not, nor stands it safe with us
    To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;
    I 
your commission will forthwith dispatch,
    And he to England shall along with you.
    The terms
 of our estate may not endure
    Hazard so near us as doth hourly grow
    Out of his lunacies.

  Guil. We will ourselves provide.
    Most holy and religious fear it is
    To keep those many m
any bodies safe
    That live and feed upon your Majesty.
  Ros. The single and peculiar life is b
ound
    With all the strength and armour of the mind
    To keep itself from noyance; but much mo
re
    That spirit upon whose weal depends and rests
    The lives of many. The cesse of majesty

    Dies not alone, but like a gulf doth draw
    What's near it with it. It is a massy wheel,
   
 Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,
    To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
   
 Are mortis'd and adjoin'd; which when it falls,
    Each small annexment, petty consequence,
    
Attends the boist'rous ruin. Never alone
    Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.
  King. 
Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;
    For we will fetters put upon this fear,
    Which 
now goes too free-footed.
  Both. We will haste us.
                                              
 Exeunt Gentlemen.

                   Enter Polonius.

  Pol. My lord, he's going to his mother
's closet.
    Behind the arras I'll convey myself
    To hear the process. I'll warrant she'll ta
x him home;
    And, as you said, and wisely was it said,
    'Tis meet that some more audience th
an a mother,
    Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear
    The speech, of vantage. Fare
 you well, my liege.
    I'll call upon you ere you go to bed
    And tell you what I know.
  Kin
g. Thanks, dear my lord.
                                                Exit [Polonius].
    O, m
y offence is rank, it smells to heaven;
    It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,
    A brother'
s murther! Pray can I not,
    Though inclination be as sharp as will.
    My stronger guilt defea
ts my strong intent,
    And, like a man to double business bound,
    I stand in pause where I sh
all first begin,
    And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
    Were thicker than itself with 
brother's blood,
    Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
    To wash it white as snow? W
hereto serves mercy
    But to confront the visage of offence?
    And what's in prayer but this t
wofold force,
    To be forestalled ere we come to fall,
    Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll loo
k up;
    My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer
    Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul
 murther'?
    That cannot be; since I am still possess'd
    Of those effects for which I did the
 murther-
    My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.
    May one be pardon'd and retain th' of
fence?
    In the corrupted currents of this world
    Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,

    And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
    Buys out the law; but 'tis not so above.
    T
here is no shuffling; there the action lies
    In his true nature, and we ourselves compell'd,
  
  Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
    To give in evidence. What then? What rests?
  
  Try what repentance can. What can it not?
    Yet what can it when one cannot repent?
    O wret
ched state! O bosom black as death!
    O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
    Art more en
gag'd! Help, angels! Make assay.
    Bow, stubborn knees; and heart with strings of steel,
    Be 
soft as sinews of the new-born babe!
    All may be well.                                  He kneel

                         Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
  
  And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven,
    And so am I reveng'd. That would be scann'd.
  
  A villain kills my father; and for that,
    I, his sole son, do this same villain send
    To h
eaven.
    Why, this is hire and salary, not revenge!
    He took my father grossly, full of bread
,
    With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
    And how his audit stands, who knows sa
ve heaven?
    But in our circumstance and course of thought,
    'Tis heavy with him; and am I th
en reveng'd,
    To take him in the purging of his soul,
    When he is fit and seasoned for his p
assage?
    No.
    Up, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent.
    When he is drunk asleep; or 
in his rage;
    Or in th' incestuous pleasure of his bed;
    At gaming, swearing, or about some 
act
    That has no relish of salvation in't-
    Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven
,
    And that his soul may be as damn'd and black
    As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays.

    This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.              Exit.
  King. [rises] My words fly up, 
my thoughts remain below.
    Words without thoughts never to heaven go.             Exit.





Scene IV.
The Queen's closet.

Enter Queen and Polonius.

  Pol. He will come straight. Look y
ou lay home to him.
    Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,
    And that your Gr
ace hath screen'd and stood between
    Much heat and him. I'll silence me even here.
    Pray you
 be round with him.
  Ham. (within) Mother, mother, mother!
  Queen. I'll warrant you; fear me not
. Withdraw; I hear him
coming.
                              [Polonius hides behind the arras.]


                          Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Now, mother, what's the matter?
  Queen. Hamlet,
 thou hast thy father much offended.
  Ham. Mother, you have my father much offended.
  Queen. Com
e, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
  Ham. Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
  Queen
. Why, how now, Hamlet?
  Ham. What's the matter now?
  Queen. Have you forgot me?
  Ham. No, by 
the rood, not so!
    You are the Queen, your husband's brother's wife,
    And (would it were not
 so!) you are my mother.
  Queen. Nay, then I'll set those to you that can speak.
  Ham. Come, com
e, and sit you down. You shall not budge;
    You go not till I set you up a glass
    Where you m
ay see the inmost part of you.
  Queen. What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murther me?
    Help, hel
p, ho!
  Pol. [behind] What, ho! help, help, help!
  Ham. [draws] How now? a rat? Dead for a ducat
, dead!
            [Makes a pass through the arras and] kills Polonius.
  Pol. [behind] O, I am s
lain!
  Queen. O me, what hast thou done?
  Ham. Nay, I know not. Is it the King?
  Queen. O, wha
t a rash and bloody deed is this!
  Ham. A bloody deed- almost as bad, good mother,
    As kill a 
king, and marry with his brother.
  Queen. As kill a king?
  Ham. Ay, lady, it was my word.
     
                    [Lifts up the arras and sees Polonius.]
    Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool
, farewell!
    I took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune.
    Thou find'st to be too busy is s
ome danger.
    Leave wringing of your hands. Peace! sit you down
    And let me wring your heart;
 for so I shall
    If it be made of penetrable stuff;
    If damned custom have not braz'd it so

    That it is proof and bulwark against sense.
  Queen. What have I done that thou dar'st wag thy
 tongue
    In noise so rude against me?
  Ham. Such an act
    That blurs the grace and blush of
 modesty;
    Calls virtue hypocrite; takes off the rose
    From the fair forehead of an innocent
 love,
    And sets a blister there; makes marriage vows
    As false as dicers' oaths. O, such a 
deed
    As from the body of contraction plucks
    The very soul, and sweet religion makes
    A
 rhapsody of words! Heaven's face doth glow;
    Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
    With tr
istful visage, as against the doom,
    Is thought-sick at the act.
  Queen. Ah me, what act,
   
 That roars so loud and thunders in the index?
  Ham. Look here upon th's picture, and on this,
  
  The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
    See what a grace was seated on this brow;
    H
yperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
    An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
    A s
tation like the herald Mercury
    New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill:
    A combination and a f
orm indeed
    Where every god did seem to set his seal
    To give the world assurance of a man.

    This was your husband. Look you now what follows.
    Here is your husband, like a mildew'd ea
r
    Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
    Could you on this fair mountain leave to 
feed,
    And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes
    You cannot call it love; for at your age

    The heyday in the blood is tame, it's humble,
    And waits upon the judgment; and what judgme
nt
    Would step from this to this? Sense sure you have,
    Else could you not have motion; but 
sure that sense
    Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,
    Nor sense to ecstacy was ne'er so
 thrall'd
    But it reserv'd some quantity of choice
    To serve in such a difference. What devi
l was't
    That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
    Eyes without feeling, feeling without
 sight,
    Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
    Or but a sickly part of one true se
nse
    Could not so mope.
    O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
    If thou canst mu
tine in a matron's bones,
    To flaming youth let virtue be as wax
    And melt in her own fire. 
Proclaim no shame
    When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
    Since frost itself as activ
ely doth burn,
    And reason panders will.
  Queen. O Hamlet, speak no more!
    Thou turn'st mi
ne eyes into my very soul,
    And there I see such black and grained spots
    As will not leave 
their tinct.
  Ham. Nay, but to live
    In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
    Stew'd in corr
uption, honeying and making love
    Over the nasty sty!
  Queen. O, speak to me no more!
    The
se words like daggers enter in mine ears.
    No more, sweet Hamlet!
  Ham. A murtherer and a vill
ain!
    A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
    Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;

    A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
    That from a shelf the precious diadem stole
    A
nd put it in his pocket!
  Queen. No more!

                Enter the Ghost in his nightgown.


  Ham. A king of shreds and patches!-
    Save me and hover o'er me with your wings,
    You heave
nly guards! What would your gracious figure?
  Queen. Alas, he's mad!
  Ham. Do you not come your 
tardy son to chide,
    That, laps'd in time and passion, lets go by
    Th' important acting of y
our dread command?
    O, say!
  Ghost. Do not forget. This visitation
    Is but to whet thy alm
ost blunted purpose.
    But look, amazement on thy mother sits.
    O, step between her and her f
ighting soul
    Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works.
    Speak to her, Hamlet.
  Ham. How 
is it with you, lady?
  Queen. Alas, how is't with you,
    That you do bend your eye on vacancy,

    And with th' encorporal air do hold discourse?
    Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep
;
    And, as the sleeping soldiers in th' alarm,
    Your bedded hairs, like life in excrements,

    Start up and stand an end. O gentle son,
    Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
    Spr
inkle cool patience! Whereon do you look?
  Ham. On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!
    
His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
    Would make them capable.- Do not look upon m
e,
    Lest with this piteous action you convert
    My stern effects. Then what I have to do
   
 Will want true colour- tears perchance for blood.
  Queen. To whom do you speak this?
  Ham. Do y
ou see nothing there?
  Queen. Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
  Ham. Nor did you nothing h
ear?
  Queen. No, nothing but ourselves.
  Ham. Why, look you there! Look how it steals away!
   
 My father, in his habit as he liv'd!
    Look where he goes even now out at the portal!
         
                                            Exit Ghost.
  Queen. This is the very coinage of your b
rain.
    This bodiless creation ecstasy
    Is very cunning in.
  Ham. Ecstasy?
    My pulse as
 yours doth temperately keep time
    And makes as healthful music. It is not madness
    That I h
ave utt'red. Bring me to the test,
    And I the matter will reword; which madness
    Would gambo
l from. Mother, for love of grace,
    Lay not that flattering unction to your soul
    That not y
our trespass but my madness speaks.
    It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
    Whiles r
ank corruption, mining all within,
    Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
    Repent what
's past; avoid what is to come;
    And do not spread the compost on the weeds
    To make them ra
nker. Forgive me this my virtue;
    For in the fatness of these pursy times
    Virtue itself of 
vice must pardon beg-
    Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.
  Queen. O Hamlet, thou hast
 cleft my heart in twain.
  Ham. O, throw away the worser part of it,
    And live the purer with 
the other half,
    Good night- but go not to my uncle's bed.
    Assume a virtue, if you have it 
not.
    That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat
    Of habits evil, is angel yet in this,
 
   That to the use of actions fair and good
    He likewise gives a frock or livery,
    That aptl
y is put on. Refrain to-night,
    And that shall lend a kind of easiness
    To the next abstinen
ce; the next more easy;
    For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
    And either [master]
 the devil, or throw him out
    With wondrous potency. Once more, good night;
    And when you ar
e desirous to be blest,
    I'll blessing beg of you.- For this same lord,
    I do repent; but he
aven hath pleas'd it so,
    To punish me with this, and this with me,
    That I must be their sc
ourge and minister.
    I will bestow him, and will answer well
    The death I gave him. So again
, good night.
    I must be cruel, only to be kind;
    Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.

    One word more, good lady.
  Queen. What shall I do?
  Ham. Not this, by no means, that I bid
 you do:
    Let the bloat King tempt you again to bed;
    Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you h
is mouse;
    And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
    Or paddling in your neck with his damn
'd fingers,
    Make you to ravel all this matter out,
    That I essentially am not in madness,

    But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;
    For who that's but a queen, fair, sober, wi
se,
    Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib
    Such dear concernings hide? Who would do so?

    No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
    Unpeg the basket on the house's top,
    Let the bird
s fly, and like the famous ape,
    To try conclusions, in the basket creep
    And break your own
 neck down.
  Queen. Be thou assur'd, if words be made of breath,
    And breath of life, I have n
o life to breathe
    What thou hast said to me.
  Ham. I must to England; you know that?
  Queen
. Alack,
    I had forgot! 'Tis so concluded on.
  Ham. There's letters seal'd; and my two schoolf
ellows,
    Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,
    They bear the mandate; they must sweep 
my way
    And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
    For 'tis the sport to have the enginer
   
 Hoist with his own petar; and 't shall go hard
    But I will delve one yard below their mines
  
  And blow them at the moon. O, 'tis most sweet
    When in one line two crafts directly meet.
   
 This man shall set me packing.
    I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.-
    Mother, good n
ight.- Indeed, this counsellor
    Is now most still, most secret, and most grave,
    Who was in 
life a foolish peating knave.
    Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.
    Good night, mothe
r.
                  [Exit the Queen. Then] Exit Hamlet, tugging in
                              
                         Polonius.

ACT IV. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the Ca
stle.

Enter King and Queen, with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  King. There's matter in these
 sighs. These profound heaves
    You must translate; 'tis fit we understand them.
    Where is yo
ur son?
  Queen. Bestow this place on us a little while.
                          [Exeunt Rosencr
antz and Guildenstern.]
    Ah, mine own lord, what have I seen to-night!
  King. What, Gertrude? 
How does Hamlet?
  Queen. Mad as the sea and wind when both contend
    Which is the mightier. In 
his lawless fit
    Behind the arras hearing something stir,
    Whips out his rapier, cries 'A ra
t, a rat!'
    And in this brainish apprehension kills
    The unseen good old man.
  King. O hea
vy deed!
    It had been so with us, had we been there.
    His liberty is full of threats to all-

    To you yourself, to us, to every one.
    Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
    
It will be laid to us, whose providence
    Should have kept short, restrain'd, and out of haunt
 
   This mad young man. But so much was our love
    We would not understand what was most fit,
   
 But, like the owner of a foul disease,
    To keep it from divulging, let it feed
    Even on the
 pith of life. Where is he gone?
  Queen. To draw apart the body he hath kill'd;
    O'er whom his
 very madness, like some ore
    Among a mineral of metals base,
    Shows itself pure. He weeps f
or what is done.
  King. O Gertrude, come away!
    The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch
 
   But we will ship him hence; and this vile deed
    We must with all our majesty and skill
    B
oth countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!

             Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.


    Friends both, go join you with some further aid.
    Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
 
   And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him.
    Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the
 body
    Into the chapel. I pray you haste in this.
                          Exeunt [Rosencrantz
 and Guildenstern].
    Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends
    And let them know bot
h what we mean to do
    And what's untimely done. [So haply slander-]
    Whose whisper o'er the 
world's diameter,
    As level as the cannon to his blank,
    Transports his poisoned shot- may m
iss our name
    And hit the woundless air.- O, come away!
    My soul is full of discord and dism
ay.
                                                         Exeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. 
A passage in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Safely stow'd.
  Gentlemen. (within) Hamlet! Lo
rd Hamlet!
  Ham. But soft! What noise? Who calls on Hamlet? O, here they
come.

               
Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Ros. What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
  Ha
m. Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
  Ros. Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence

    And bear it to the chapel.
  Ham. Do not believe it.
  Ros. Believe what?
  Ham. That I can
 keep your counsel, and not mine own. Besides,
to be
    demanded of a sponge, what replication sh
ould be made by the
son
    of a king?
  Ros. Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
  Ham. Ay, sir;
 that soaks up the King's countenance, his
rewards,
    his authorities. But such officers do the 
King best service
in
    the end. He keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his
jaw;
    firs
t mouth'd, to be last swallowed. When he needs what you
have
    glean'd, it is but squeezing you 
and, sponge, you shall be
dry
    again.
  Ros. I understand you not, my lord.
  Ham. I am glad 
of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.
  Ros. My lord, you must tell us where the body is
 and go with us
to
    the King.
  Ham. The body is with the King, but the King is not with the

body.
    The King is a thing-
  Guil. A thing, my lord?
  Ham. Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide
 fox, and all after.
                                                         Exeunt.




Scen
e III.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King.

  King. I have sent to seek him and to fin
d the body.
    How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
    Yet must not we put the strong l
aw on him.
    He's lov'd of the distracted multitude,
    Who like not in their judgment, but the
ir eyes;
    And where 'tis so, th' offender's scourge is weigh'd,
    But never the offence. To b
ear all smooth and even,
    This sudden sending him away must seem
    Deliberate pause. Diseases
 desperate grown
    By desperate appliance are reliev'd,
    Or not at all.

                  
  Enter Rosencrantz.

    How now O What hath befall'n?
  Ros. Where the dead body is bestow'd, m
y lord,
    We cannot get from him.
  King. But where is he?
  Ros. Without, my lord; guarded, to
 know your pleasure.
  King. Bring him before us.
  Ros. Ho, Guildenstern! Bring in my lord.

  
      Enter Hamlet and Guildenstern [with Attendants].

  King. Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
  
Ham. At supper.
  King. At supper? Where?
  Ham. Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A certa
in
    convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your worm is
your
    only emperor for diet.
 We fat all creatures else to fat us,
and
    we fat ourselves for maggots. Your fat king and your
 lean
beggar
    is but variable service- two dishes, but to one table. That's
the
    end.
  K
ing. Alas, alas!
  Ham. A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and
eat
    of the 
fish that hath fed of that worm.
  King. What dost thou mean by this?
  Ham. Nothing but to show y
ou how a king may go a progress
through
    the guts of a beggar.
  King. Where is Polonius?
  H
am. In heaven. Send thither to see. If your messenger find him
not
    there, seek him i' th' othe
r place yourself. But indeed, if
you
    find him not within this month, you shall nose him as you
 go
up
    the stair, into the lobby.
  King. Go seek him there. [To Attendants.]
  Ham. He will
 stay till you come.
                                            [Exeunt Attendants.]
  King. Haml
et, this deed, for thine especial safety,-
    Which we do tender as we dearly grieve
    For that
 which thou hast done,- must send thee hence
    With fiery quickness. Therefore prepare thyself.

    The bark is ready and the wind at help,
    Th' associates tend, and everything is bent
    Fo
r England.
  Ham. For England?
  King. Ay, Hamlet.
  Ham. Good.
  King. So is it, if thou knew's
t our purposes.
  Ham. I see a cherub that sees them. But come, for England!
    Farewell, dear mo
ther.
  King. Thy loving father, Hamlet.
  Ham. My mother! Father and mother is man and wife; man 
and wife
is
    one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England!
Exit.
  King. Follow him at foo
t; tempt him with speed aboard.
    Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night.
    Away! for ever
ything is seal'd and done
    That else leans on th' affair. Pray you make haste.
                
            Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]
    And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught
,-
    As my great power thereof may give thee sense,
    Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and re
d
    After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
    Pays homage to us,- thou mayst not coldly set

    Our sovereign process, which imports at full,
    By letters congruing to that effect,
    The
 present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;
    For like the hectic in my blood he rages,
    And th
ou must cure me. Till I know 'tis done,

Scene IV.
Near Elsinore.

Enter Fortinbras with his Army over the stag
e.

  For. Go, Captain, from me greet the Danish king.
    Tell him that by his license Fortinbra
s
    Craves the conveyance of a promis'd march
    Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.
  
  If that his Majesty would aught with us,
    We shall express our duty in his eye;
    And let h
im know so.
  Capt. I will do't, my lord.
  For. Go softly on.
                                  
 Exeunt [all but the Captain].

       Enter Hamlet, Rosencrantz, [Guildenstern,] and others.

 
 Ham. Good sir, whose powers are these?
  Capt. They are of Norway, sir.
  Ham. How purpos'd, sir,
 I pray you?
  Capt. Against some part of Poland.
  Ham. Who commands them, sir?
  Capt. The neph
ew to old Norway, Fortinbras.
  Ham. Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
    Or for some fron
tier?
  Capt. Truly to speak, and with no addition,
    We go to gain a little patch of ground
  
  That hath in it no profit but the name.
    To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
    N
or will it yield to Norway or the Pole
    A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
  Ham. Why, th
en the Polack never will defend it.
  Capt. Yes, it is already garrison'd.
  Ham. Two thousand sou
ls and twenty thousand ducats
    Will not debate the question of this straw.
    This is th' impo
sthume of much wealth and peace,
    That inward breaks, and shows no cause without
    Why the ma
n dies.- I humbly thank you, sir.
  Capt. God b' wi' you, sir.                             [Exit.]

  Ros. Will't please you go, my lord?
  Ham. I'll be with you straight. Go a little before.
     
                                   [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]
    How all occasions do inform against
 me
    And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
    If his chief good and market of his time
   
 Be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.
    Sure he that made us with such large discourse,
 
   Looking before and after, gave us not
    That capability and godlike reason
    To fust in us 
unus'd. Now, whether it be
    Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple
    Of thinking too precis
ely on th' event,-
    A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
    And ever three par
ts coward,- I do not know
    Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do,'
    Sith I have cause, a
nd will, and strength, and means
    To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me.
    Witness this 
army of such mass and charge,
    Led by a delicate and tender prince,
    Whose spirit, with divi
ne ambition puff'd,
    Makes mouths at the invisible event,
    Exposing what is mortal and unsur
e
    To all that fortune, death, and danger dare,
    Even for an eggshell. Rightly to be great

    Is not to stir without great argument,
    But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
    When hon
our's at the stake. How stand I then,
    That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,
    Excitem
ents of my reason and my blood,
    And let all sleep, while to my shame I see
    The imminent de
ath of twenty thousand men
    That for a fantasy and trick of fame
    Go to their graves like be
ds, fight for a plot
    Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
    Which is not tomb enough an
d continent
    To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,
    My thoughts be bloody, or be nothi
ng worth!            Exit.

Scene V.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter H
oratio, Queen, and a Gentleman.

  Queen. I will not speak with her.
  Gent. She is importunate, 
indeed distract.
    Her mood will needs be pitied.
  Queen. What would she have?
  Gent. She spe
aks much of her father; says she hears
    There's tricks i' th' world, and hems, and beats her hea
rt;
    Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,
    That carry but half sense. Her spe
ech is nothing,
    Yet the unshaped use of it doth move
    The hearers to collection; they aim a
t it,
    And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;
    Which, as her winks and nods and g
estures yield them,
    Indeed would make one think there might be thought,
    Though nothing sur
e, yet much unhappily.
  Hor. 'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew
    Dangerous co
njectures in ill-breeding minds.
  Queen. Let her come in.
                                       
        [Exit Gentleman.]
    [Aside] To my sick soul (as sin's true nature is)
    Each toy seems
 Prologue to some great amiss.
    So full of artless jealousy is guilt
    It spills itself in fe
aring to be spilt.

                 Enter Ophelia distracted.

  Oph. Where is the beauteous Ma
jesty of Denmark?
  Queen. How now, Ophelia?
  Oph. (sings)
         How should I your true-love 
know
           From another one?
         By his cockle bat and' staff
           And his sandal
 shoon.

  Queen. Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
  Oph. Say you? Nay, pray You mark.


    (Sings) He is dead and gone, lady,
              He is dead and gone;
            At his hea
d a grass-green turf,
              At his heels a stone.

    O, ho!
  Queen. Nay, but Ophelia-

  Oph. Pray you mark.

    (Sings) White his shroud as the mountain snow-

                   
 Enter King.

  Queen. Alas, look here, my lord!
  Oph. (Sings)
           Larded all with sweet
 flowers;
         Which bewept to the grave did not go
           With true-love showers.

  Ki
ng. How do you, pretty lady?
  Oph. Well, God dild you! They say the owl was a baker's
daughter.

    Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be. God
be at
    your table!
  King. Con
ceit upon her father.
  Oph. Pray let's have no words of this; but when they ask, you
what
    it
 means, say you this:

    (Sings) To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,
              All in the m
orning bedtime,
            And I a maid at your window,
              To be your Valentine.

  
          Then up he rose and donn'd his clo'es
              And dupp'd the chamber door,
       
     Let in the maid, that out a maid
              Never departed more.

  King. Pretty Ophelia!

  Oph. Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't!

    [Sings] By Gis and by Saint Char
ity,
              Alack, and fie for shame!
            Young men will do't if they come to't
  
            By Cock, they are to blame.

            Quoth she, 'Before you tumbled me,
         
     You promis'd me to wed.'

    He answers:

            'So would I 'a' done, by yonder sun,

              An thou hadst not come to my bed.'

  King. How long hath she been thus?
  Oph. I
 hope all will be well. We must be patient; but I cannot
    choose but weep to think they would la
y him i' th' cold
ground.
    My brother shall know of it; and so I thank you for your good
    c
ounsel. Come, my coach! Good night, ladies. Good night,
sweet
    ladies. Good night, good night. 
                        Exit
  King. Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.
          
                                       [Exit Horatio.]

    O, this is the poison of deep grief; i
t springs
    All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
    When sorrows come, they come 
not single spies.
    But in battalions! First, her father slain;
    Next, your son gone, and he 
most violent author
    Of his own just remove; the people muddied,
    Thick and and unwholesome 
in their thoughts and whispers
    For good Polonius' death, and we have done but greenly
    In h
ugger-mugger to inter him; poor Ophelia
    Divided from herself and her fair judgment,
    Withou
t the which we are pictures or mere beasts;
    Last, and as much containing as all these,
    Her
 brother is in secret come from France;
    And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
    Feeds on h
is wonder, keep, himself in clouds,
    With pestilent speeches of his father's death,
    Wherein
 necessity, of matter beggar'd,
    Will nothing stick our person to arraign
    In ear and ear. O
 my dear Gertrude, this,
    Like to a murd'ring piece, in many places
    Give me superfluous dea
th.                  A noise within.
  Queen. Alack, what noise is this?
  King. Where are my Swit
zers? Let them guard the door.

                     Enter a Messenger.

    What is the matter?

  Mess. Save Yourself, my lord:
    The ocean, overpeering of his list,
    Eats not the flats w
ith more impetuous haste
    Than Young Laertes, in a riotous head,
    O'erbears Your offices. Th
e rabble call him lord;
    And, as the world were now but to begin,
    Antiquity forgot, custom 
not known,
    The ratifiers and props of every word,
    They cry 'Choose we! Laertes shall be ki
ng!'
    Caps, hands, and tongues applaud it to the clouds,
    'Laertes shall be king! Laertes ki
ng!'
                                                 A noise within.
  Queen. How cheerfully on t
he false trail they cry!
    O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!
  King. The doors are brok
e.

                    Enter Laertes with others.

  Laer. Where is this king?- Sirs, staid you
 all without.
  All. No, let's come in!
  Laer. I pray you give me leave.
  All. We will, we will
!
  Laer. I thank you. Keep the door.      [Exeunt his Followers.]
    O thou vile king,
    Give
 me my father!
  Queen. Calmly, good Laertes.
  Laer. That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me 
bastard;
    Cries cuckold to my father; brands the harlot
    Even here between the chaste unsmir
ched brows
    Of my true mother.
  King. What is the cause, Laertes,
    That thy rebellion look
s so giantlike?
    Let him go, Gertrude. Do not fear our person.
    There's such divinity doth h
edge a king
    That treason can but peep to what it would,
    Acts little of his will. Tell me, 
Laertes,
    Why thou art thus incens'd. Let him go, Gertrude.
    Speak, man.
  Laer. Where is m
y father?
  King. Dead.
  Queen. But not by him!
  King. Let him demand his fill.
  Laer. How ca
me he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
    To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil
    Con
science and grace, to the profoundest pit!
    I dare damnation. To this point I stand,
    That b
oth the world, I give to negligence,
    Let come what comes; only I'll be reveng'd
    Most throu
ghly for my father.
  King. Who shall stay you?
  Laer. My will, not all the world!
    And for m
y means, I'll husband them so well
    They shall go far with little.
  King. Good Laertes,
    I
f you desire to know the certainty
    Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge
    
That sweepstake you will draw both friend and foe,
    Winner and loser?
  Laer. None but his enem
ies.
  King. Will you know them then?
  Laer. To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms
    
And, like the kind life-rend'ring pelican,
    Repast them with my blood.
  King. Why, now You spe
ak
    Like a good child and a true gentleman.
    That I am guiltless of your father's death,
  
  And am most sensibly in grief for it,
    It shall as level to your judgment pierce
    As day d
oes to your eye.
                              A noise within: 'Let her come in.'
  Laer. How now?
 What noise is that?

                      Enter Ophelia.

    O heat, dry up my brains! Tears 
seven times salt
    Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!
    By heaven, thy madness shall b
e paid by weight
    Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!
    Dear maid, kind sister, swee
t Ophelia!
    O heavens! is't possible a young maid's wits
    Should be as mortal as an old man'
s life?
    Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,
    It sends some precious instance of it
self
    After the thing it loves.

  Oph. (sings)
         They bore him barefac'd on the bier

           (Hey non nony, nony, hey nony)
         And in his grave rain'd many a tear.

    Far
e you well, my dove!
  Laer. Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
    It could not mov
e thus.
  Oph. You must sing 'A-down a-down, and you call him a-down-a.'
O,
    how the wheel bec
omes it! It is the false steward, that stole
his
    master's daughter.
  Laer. This nothing's mo
re than matter.
  Oph. There's rosemary, that's for remembrance. Pray you, love,
    remember. And
 there is pansies, that's for thoughts.
  Laer. A document in madness! Thoughts and remembrance fit
ted.
  Oph. There's fennel for you, and columbines. There's rue for
you,
    and here's some for 
me. We may call it herb of grace o'
Sundays.
    O, you must wear your rue with a difference! Ther
e's a daisy.
I
    would give you some violets, but they wither'd all when my
father
    died. T
hey say he made a good end.

    [Sings] For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.

  Laer. Thought a
nd affliction, passion, hell itself,
    She turns to favour and to prettiness.
  Oph. (sings)
  
       And will he not come again?
         And will he not come again?
           No, no, he is d
ead;
           Go to thy deathbed;
         He never will come again.

         His beard was a
s white as snow,
         All flaxen was his poll.
           He is gone, he is gone,
           
And we cast away moan.
         God 'a'mercy on his soul!

    And of all Christian souls, I pray
 God. God b' wi' you.
Exit.
  Laer. Do you see this, O God?
  King. Laertes, I must commune with 
your grief,
    Or you deny me right. Go but apart,
    Make choice of whom your wisest friends yo
u will,
    And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me.
    If by direct or by collateral han
d
    They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,
    Our crown, our life, and all that we cal
l ours,
    To you in satisfaction; but if not,
    Be you content to lend your patience to us,
 
   And we shall jointly labour with your soul
    To give it due content.
  Laer. Let this be so.

    His means of death, his obscure funeral-
    No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,

    No noble rite nor formal ostentation,-
    Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
  
  That I must call't in question.
  King. So you shall;
    And where th' offence is let the great
 axe fall.
    I pray you go with me.
                                                          Ex
eunt

grapple I

Scene VII.
Elsinore. Another room in the Castl
e.

Enter King and Laertes.

  King. Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
    And You 
must put me in your heart for friend,
    Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
    That he
 which hath your noble father slain
    Pursued my life.
  Laer. It well appears. But tell me
   
 Why you proceeded not against these feats
    So crimeful and so capital in nature,
    As by you
r safety, wisdom, all things else,
    You mainly were stirr'd up.
  King. O, for two special reas
ons,
    Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,
    But yet to me they are strong. The Qu
een his mother
    Lives almost by his looks; and for myself,-
    My virtue or my plague, be it e
ither which,-
    She's so conjunctive to my life and soul
    That, as the star moves not but in 
his sphere,
    I could not but by her. The other motive
    Why to a public count I might not go

    Is the great love the general gender bear him,
    Who, dipping all his faults in their affect
ion,
    Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
    Convert his gives to graces; so th
at my arrows,
    Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,
    Would have reverted to my bow agai
n,
    And not where I had aim'd them.
  Laer. And so have I a noble father lost;
    A sister dr
iven into desp'rate terms,
    Whose worth, if praises may go back again,
    Stood challenger on 
mount of all the age
    For her perfections. But my revenge will come.
  King. Break not your sle
eps for that. You must not think
    That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
    That we can le
t our beard be shook with danger,
    And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more.
    I lov
'd your father, and we love ourself,
    And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine-

          
       Enter a Messenger with letters.

    How now? What news?
  Mess. Letters, my lord, from Ha
mlet:
    This to your Majesty; this to the Queen.
  King. From Hamlet? Who brought them?
  Mess.
 Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not.
    They were given me by Claudio; he receiv'd them
 
   Of him that brought them.
  King. Laertes, you shall hear them.
    Leave us.
                
                                 Exit Messenger.
    [Reads]'High and Mighty,-You shall know I am s
et naked on
your
    kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes;
    when I sha
ll (first asking your pardon thereunto) recount the
    occasion of my sudden and more strange retu
rn.
                                                     'HAMLET.'
    What should this mean? Are 
all the rest come back?
    Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?
  Laer. Know you the hand?
  
King. 'Tis Hamlet's character. 'Naked!'
    And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'
    Can you
 advise me?
  Laer. I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come!
    It warms the very sickness in 
my heart
    That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,
    'Thus didest thou.'
  King. If it b
e so, Laertes
    (As how should it be so? how otherwise?),
    Will you be rul'd by me?
  Laer. 
Ay my lord,
    So you will not o'errule me to a peace.
  King. To thine own peace. If he be now r
eturn'd
    As checking at his voyage, and that he means
    No more to undertake it, I will work 
him
    To exploit now ripe in my device,
    Under the which he shall not choose but fall;
    A
nd for his death no wind shall breathe
    But even his mother shall uncharge the practice
    And
 call it accident.
  Laer. My lord, I will be rul'd;
    The rather, if you could devise it so
  
  That I might be the organ.
  King. It falls right.
    You have been talk'd of since your travel
 much,
    And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality
    Wherein they say you shine, Your sum of
 parts
    Did not together pluck such envy from him
    As did that one; and that, in my regard,

    Of the unworthiest siege.
  Laer. What part is that, my lord?
  King. A very riband in the ca
p of youth-
    Yet needfull too; for youth no less becomes
    The light and careless livery that
 it wears
    Than settled age his sables and his weeds,
    Importing health and graveness. Two m
onths since
    Here was a gentleman of Normandy.
    I have seen myself, and serv'd against, the 
French,
    And they can well on horseback; but this gallant
    Had witchcraft in't. He grew unto
 his seat,
    And to such wondrous doing brought his horse
    As had he been incorps'd and demi-
natur'd
    With the brave beast. So far he topp'd my thought
    That I, in forgery of shapes and
 tricks,
    Come short of what he did.
  Laer. A Norman was't?
  King. A Norman.
  Laer. Upon m
y life, Lamound.
  King. The very same.
  Laer. I know him well. He is the broach indeed
    And 
gem of all the nation.
  King. He made confession of you;
    And gave you such a masterly report

    For art and exercise in your defence,
    And for your rapier most especially,
    That he cr
ied out 'twould be a sight indeed
    If one could match you. The scrimers of their nation
    He 
swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
    If you oppos'd them. Sir, this report of his
    Did
 Hamlet so envenom with his envy
    That he could nothing do but wish and beg
    Your sudden com
ing o'er to play with you.
    Now, out of this-
  Laer. What out of this, my lord?
  King. Laert
es, was your father dear to you?
    Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
    A face without 
a heart,'
  Laer. Why ask you this?
  King. Not that I think you did not love your father;
    Bu
t that I know love is begun by time,
    And that I see, in passages of proof,
    Time qualifies 
the spark and fire of it.
    There lives within the very flame of love
    A kind of wick or snuf
f that will abate it;
    And nothing is at a like goodness still;
    For goodness, growing to a 
plurisy,
    Dies in his own too-much. That we would do,
    We should do when we would; for this 
'would' changes,
    And hath abatements and delays as many
    As there are tongues, are hands, a
re accidents;
    And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
    That hurts by easing. But
 to the quick o' th' ulcer!
    Hamlet comes back. What would you undertake
    To show yourself y
our father's son in deed
    More than in words?
  Laer. To cut his throat i' th' church!
  King.
 No place indeed should murther sanctuarize;
    Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,

    Will you do this? Keep close within your chamber.
    Hamlet return'd shall know you are come 
home.
    We'll put on those shall praise your excellence
    And set a double varnish on the fame

    The Frenchman gave you; bring you in fine together
    And wager on your heads. He, being rem
iss,
    Most generous, and free from all contriving,
    Will not peruse the foils; so that with 
ease,
    Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
    A sword unbated, and, in a pass of practi
ce,
    Requite him for your father.
  Laer. I will do't!
    And for that purpose I'll anoint my
 sword.
    I bought an unction of a mountebank,
    So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
    W
here it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
    Collected from all simples that have virtue
    Unde
r the moon, can save the thing from death
    This is but scratch'd withal. I'll touch my point
  
  With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
    It may be death.
  King. Let's further th
ink of this,
    Weigh what convenience both of time and means
    May fit us to our shape. If thi
s should fall,
    And that our drift look through our bad performance.
    'Twere better not assa
y'd. Therefore this project
    Should have a back or second, that might hold
    If this did blas
t in proof. Soft! let me see.
    We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings-
    I ha't!
    Whe
n in your motion you are hot and dry-
    As make your bouts more violent to that end-
    And tha
t he calls for drink, I'll have prepar'd him
    A chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,
   
 If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
    Our purpose may hold there.- But stay, what noise,


                           Enter Queen.

    How now, sweet queen?
  Queen. One woe doth tread
 upon another's heel,
    So fast they follow. Your sister's drown'd, Laertes.
  Laer. Drown'd! O,
 where?
  Queen. There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
    That shows his hoar leaves in the gla
ssy stream.
    There with fantastic garlands did she come
    Of crowflowers, nettles, daisies, a
nd long purples,
    That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
    But our cold maids do dead me
n's fingers call them.
    There on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds
    Clamb'ring to hang, a
n envious sliver broke,
    When down her weedy trophies and herself
    Fell in the weeping brook
. Her clothes spread wide
    And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up;
    Which time she chaun
ted snatches of old tunes,
    As one incapable of her own distress,
    Or like a creature native
 and indued
    Unto that element; but long it could not be
    Till that her garments, heavy with
 their drink,
    Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay
    To muddy death.
  Laer. Alas,
 then she is drown'd?
  Queen. Drown'd, drown'd.
  Laer. Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia
,
    And therefore I forbid my tears; but yet
    It is our trick; nature her custom holds,
    
Let shame say what it will. When these are gone,
    The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord.
    I 
have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze
    But that this folly douts it.                     
     Exit.
  King. Let's follow, Gertrude.
    How much I had to do to calm his rage I
    Now fe
ar I this will give it start again;
    Therefore let's follow.
                                  
                       Exeunt.

ACT V. Scene I.
Elsinore. A churchyard.

Ente
r two Clowns, [with spades and pickaxes].

  Clown. Is she to be buried in Christian burial when s
he
wilfully
    seeks her own salvation?
  Other. I tell thee she is; therefore make her grave st
raight.
    The crowner hath sate on her, and finds it Christian burial.
  Clown. How can that be,
 unless she drown'd herself in her own
    defence?
  Other. Why, 'tis found so.
  Clown. It must
 be se offendendo; it cannot be else. For here
lies
    the point: if I drown myself wittingly, it
 argues an act; and
an
    act hath three branches-it is to act, to do, and to perform;
    argal
, she drown'd herself wittingly.
  Other. Nay, but hear you, Goodman Delver!
  Clown. Give me leav
e. Here lies the water; good. Here stands
the
    man; good. If the man go to this water and drown
 himself, it
is,
    will he nill he, he goes- mark you that. But if the water
come to
    him a
nd drown him, he drowns not himself. Argal, he that is
not
    guilty of his own death shortens no
t his own life.
  Other. But is this law?
  Clown. Ay, marry, is't- crowner's quest law.
  Other.
 Will you ha' the truth an't? If this had not been a
    gentlewoman, she should have been buried o
ut o' Christian
burial.
  Clown. Why, there thou say'st! And the more pity that great
folk
    s
hould have count'nance in this world to drown or hang
themselves
    more than their even-Christia
n. Come, my spade! There is no
    ancient gentlemen but gard'ners, ditchers, and grave-makers.
Th
ey
    hold up Adam's profession.
  Other. Was he a gentleman?
  Clown. 'A was the first that eve
r bore arms.
  Other. Why, he had none.
  Clown. What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the

Scripture?
    The Scripture says Adam digg'd. Could he dig without arms?
I'll
    put another 
question to thee. If thou answerest me not to the
    purpose, confess thyself-
  Other. Go to!
 
 Clown. What is he that builds stronger than either the mason,
the
    shipwright, or the carpente
r?
  Other. The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand
    tenants.
  Clown. I like th
y wit well, in good faith. The gallows does
well.
    But how does it well? It does well to those 
that do ill. Now,
    thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the
    church. Arga
l, the gallows may do well to thee. To't again,
come!
  Other. Who builds stronger than a mason, a
 shipwright, or a
    carpenter?
  Clown. Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
  Other. Marry, now I can
 tell!
  Clown. To't.
  Other. Mass, I cannot tell.

                 Enter Hamlet and Horatio a
far off.

  Clown. Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull ass
will
    not mend his p
ace with beating; and when you are ask'd this
    question next, say 'a grave-maker.' The houses he
 makes lasts
    till doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan; fetch me a stoup of
    liquor.
        
                                    [Exit Second Clown.]


                       [Clown digs and
] sings.

       In youth when I did love, did love,
         Methought it was very sweet;
     
  To contract- O- the time for- a- my behove,
         O, methought there- a- was nothing- a- meet.


  Ham. Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings
at
    grave-making?
  Hor. 
Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.
  Ham. 'Tis e'en so. The hand of little employme
nt hath the
daintier
    sense.
  Clown. (sings)
         But age with his stealing steps
     
      Hath clawed me in his clutch,
         And hath shipped me intil the land,
           As if 
I had never been such.
                                            [Throws up a skull.]

  Ham. T
hat skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once. How
the
    knave jowls it to the ground,as if 
'twere Cain's jawbone,
that
    did the first murther! This might be the pate of a
Politician,
 
   which this ass now o'erreaches; one that would circumvent
God,
    might it not?
  Hor. It mig
ht, my lord.
  Ham. Or of a courtier, which could say 'Good morrow, sweet
lord!
    How dost thou
, good lord?' This might be my Lord Such-a-one,
that
    prais'd my Lord Such-a-one's horse when h
e meant to beg it-
might
    it not?
  Hor. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Why, e'en so! and now my Lady Wo
rm's, chapless, and
knock'd
    about the mazzard with a sexton's spade. Here's fine
revolution,

    and we had the trick to see't. Did these bones cost no more
the
    breeding but to play at l
oggets with 'em? Mine ache to think
    on't.
  Clown. (Sings)
         A pickaxe and a spade, a 
spade,
           For and a shrouding sheet;
         O, a Pit of clay for to be made
           
For such a guest is meet.
                                      Throws up [another skull].

  Ham
. There's another. Why may not that be the skull of a
lawyer?
    Where be his quiddits now, his q
uillets, his cases, his
tenures,
    and his tricks? Why does he suffer this rude knave now to
kn
ock
    him about the sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell
him
    of his action of batt
ery? Hum! This fellow might be in's time
a
    great buyer of land, with his statutes, his recogni
zances,
his
    fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries. Is this the fine
of
    his fines, a
nd the recovery of his recoveries, to have his
fine
    pate full of fine dirt? Will his vouchers 
vouch him no more
of
    his purchases, and double ones too, than the length and
breadth
    of 
a pair of indentures? The very conveyances of his lands
will
    scarcely lie in this box; and mus
t th' inheritor himself have
no
    more, ha?
  Hor. Not a jot more, my lord.
  Ham. Is not parc
hment made of sheepskins?
  Hor. Ay, my lord, And of calveskins too.
  Ham. They are sheep and cal
ves which seek out assurance in
that. I
    will speak to this fellow. Whose grave's this, sirrah?

  Clown. Mine, sir.

    [Sings] O, a pit of clay for to be made
              For such a guest
 is meet.

  Ham. I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in't.
  Clown. You lie out on't, sir
, and therefore 'tis not yours.
    For my part, I do not lie in't, yet it is mine.
  Ham. Thou do
st lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine. 'Tis
for
    the dead, not for the quick; therefore t
hou liest.
  Clown. 'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away again from me to you.
  Ham. What man dost 
thou dig it for?
  Clown. For no man, sir.
  Ham. What woman then?
  Clown. For none neither.
  
Ham. Who is to be buried in't?
  Clown. One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's
dead.

  Ham. How absolute the knave is! We must speak by the card, or
    equivocation will undo us. By
 the Lord, Horatio, this three
years
    I have taken note of it, the age is grown so picked that 
the
toe
    of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he
galls
    his kibe.- How lo
ng hast thou been a grave-maker?
  Clown. Of all the days i' th' year, I came to't that day that
o
ur
    last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.
  Ham. How long is that since?
  Clown. Cannot you t
ell that? Every fool can tell that. It was
the
    very day that young Hamlet was born- he that is
 mad, and sent
    into England.
  Ham. Ay, marry, why was be sent into England?
  Clown. Why, be
cause 'a was mad. 'A shall recover his wits
there;
    or, if 'a do not, 'tis no great matter ther
e.
  Ham. Why?
  Clown. 'Twill not he seen in him there. There the men are as
mad as
    he.
  
Ham. How came he mad?
  Clown. Very strangely, they say.
  Ham. How strangely?
  Clown. Faith, e'
en with losing his wits.
  Ham. Upon what ground?
  Clown. Why, here in Denmark. I have been sexto
n here, man and
boy
    thirty years.
  Ham. How long will a man lie i' th' earth ere he rot?
  
Clown. Faith, if 'a be not rotten before 'a die (as we have
many
    pocky corses now-a-days that 
will scarce hold the laying in,
I
    will last you some eight year or nine year. A tanner will
l
ast
    you nine year.
  Ham. Why he more than another?
  Clown. Why, sir, his hide is so tann'd 
with his trade that 'a
will
    keep out water a great while; and your water is a sore
decayer of

    your whoreson dead body. Here's a skull now. This skull hath
lien
    you i' th' earth three
-and-twenty years.
  Ham. Whose was it?
  Clown. A whoreson, mad fellow's it was. Whose do you thi
nk it
was?
  Ham. Nay, I know not.
  Clown. A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! 'A pour'd a flag
on
of
    Rhenish on my head once. This same skull, sir, was Yorick's
    skull, the King's jeste
r.
  Ham. This?
  Clown. E'en that.
  Ham. Let me see. [Takes the skull.] Alas, poor Yorick! I kn
ew
him,
    Horatio. A fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy.
He
    hath borne me on
 his back a thousand times. And now how
abhorred
    in my imagination it is! My gorge rises at it
. Here hung
those
    lips that I have kiss'd I know not how oft. Where be your
gibes
    now? y
our gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment that
    were wont to set the table on a roar? N
ot one now, to mock
your
    own grinning? Quite chap- fall'n? Now get you to my lady's
    chamb
er, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this
    favour she must come. Make her laugh at 
that. Prithee,
Horatio,
    tell me one thing.
  Hor. What's that, my lord?
  Ham. Dost thou thi
nk Alexander look'd o' this fashion i' th'
earth?
  Hor. E'en so.
  Ham. And smelt so? Pah!
    
                                      [Puts down the skull.]
  Hor. E'en so, my lord.
  Ham. To wh
at base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not
    imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander 
till he find it
    stopping a bunghole?
  Hor. 'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.

  Ham. No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with
modesty
    enough, and likelihood to
 lead it; as thus: Alexander died,
    Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dus
t
is
    earth; of earth we make loam; and why of that loam (whereto
he
    was converted) might
 they not stop a beer barrel?
    Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
    Might stop a hole
 to keep the wind away.
    O, that that earth which kept the world in awe
    Should patch a wall
 t' expel the winter's flaw!
    But soft! but soft! aside! Here comes the King-

    Enter [prie
sts with] a coffin [in funeral procession], King,
             Queen, Laertes, with Lords attendant
.]

    The Queen, the courtiers. Who is this they follow?
    And with such maimed rites? This d
oth betoken
    The corse they follow did with desp'rate hand
    Fordo it own life. 'Twas of some
 estate.
    Couch we awhile, and mark.
                                         [Retires with Hor
atio.]

  Laer. What ceremony else?
  Ham. That is Laertes,
    A very noble youth. Mark.
  Lae
r. What ceremony else?
  Priest. Her obsequies have been as far enlarg'd
    As we have warranty. 
Her death was doubtful;
    And, but that great command o'ersways the order,
    She should in gro
und unsanctified have lodg'd
    Till the last trumpet. For charitable prayers,
    Shards, flints
, and pebbles should be thrown on her.
    Yet here she is allow'd her virgin rites,
    Her maide
n strewments, and the bringing home
    Of bell and burial.
  Laer. Must there no more be done?
 
 Priest. No more be done.
    We should profane the service of the dead
    To sing a requiem and 
such rest to her
    As to peace-parted souls.
  Laer. Lay her i' th' earth;
    And from her fai
r and unpolluted flesh
    May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,
    A minist'ring ang
el shall my sister be
    When thou liest howling.
  Ham. What, the fair Ophelia?
  Queen. Sweets
 to the sweet! Farewell.
                                             [Scatters flowers.]
    I ho
p'd thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
    I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet mai
d,
    And not have strew'd thy grave.
  Laer. O, treble woe
    Fall ten times treble on that cu
rsed head
    Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
    Depriv'd thee of! Hold off the earth 
awhile,
    Till I have caught her once more in mine arms.
                                       
      Leaps in the grave.
    Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead
    Till of this flat a m
ountain you have made
    T' o'ertop old Pelion or the skyish head
    Of blue Olympus.
  Ham. [c

    Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow
    Conjur

  Ham. Thou pray'st not well.

    Yet have I in
 me something dangerous,
    Which let thy wisdom fear. Hold off thy hand!

  Ham. Why, I will fight with him upon this theme
    Until my eyelids will no longe

  Queen. O my son, what theme?
  Ham. I lov'd Ophelia. Forty thousand brothers
    Could n
ot (with all their quantity of love)
    Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?
  King. O, he 
is mad, Laertes.
  Queen. For love of God, forbear him!
  Ham. 'Swounds, show me what thou't do.

    Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?
    Woo't drink up esill? eat a crocod

    I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?
    To outface me with leaping in her grave?

    And thus a while the fit will work on him.

When that her golden couplets are disclos'd,
    His silence will sit drooping.
  Ham. Hear you, s

    What is the reason that you use me thus?
    I lov'd you ever. But it is no matter.

Scene II
.
Elsinore. A hall in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet and Horatio.

  Ham. So much for this, sir; now
 shall you see the other.
    You do remember all the circumstance?
  Hor. Remember it, my lord!

  Ham. Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting
    That would not let me sleep. Methought I l
ay
    Worse than the mutinies in the bilboes. Rashly-
    And prais'd be rashness for it; let us 
know,
    Our indiscretion sometime serves us well
    When our deep plots do pall; and that shoul
d learn us
    There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
    Rough-hew them how we will-
  Hor. Th
at is most certain.
  Ham. Up from my cabin,
    My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
    Gr
op'd I to find out them; had my desire,
    Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew
    To min
e own room again; making so bold
    (My fears forgetting manners) to unseal
    Their grand commi
ssion; where I found, Horatio
    (O royal knavery!), an exact command,
    Larded with many sever
al sorts of reasons,
    Importing Denmark's health, and England's too,
    With, hoo! such bugs a
nd goblins in my life-
    That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
    No, not to stay the findi
ng of the axe,
    My head should be struck off.
  Hor. Is't possible?
  Ham. Here's the commissi
on; read it at more leisure.
    But wilt thou bear me how I did proceed?
  Hor. I beseech you.
 
 Ham. Being thus benetted round with villanies,
    Or I could make a prologue to my brains,
    T
hey had begun the play. I sat me down;
    Devis'd a new commission; wrote it fair.
    I once did
 hold it, as our statists do,
    A baseness to write fair, and labour'd much
    How to forget th
at learning; but, sir, now
    It did me yeoman's service. Wilt thou know
    Th' effect of what I
 wrote?
  Hor. Ay, good my lord.
  Ham. An earnest conjuration from the King,
    As England was 
his faithful tributary,
    As love between them like the palm might flourish,
    As peace should
 still her wheaten garland wear
    And stand a comma 'tween their amities,
    And many such-like
 as's of great charge,
    That, on the view and knowing of these contents,
    Without debatement
 further, more or less,
    He should the bearers put to sudden death,
    Not shriving time allow
'd.
  Hor. How was this seal'd?
  Ham. Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
    I had my father
's signet in my purse,
    Which was the model of that Danish seal;
    Folded the writ up in the 
form of th' other,
    Subscrib'd it, gave't th' impression, plac'd it safely,
    The changeling 
never known. Now, the next day
    Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent
    Thou know's
t already.
  Hor. So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.
  Ham. Why, man, they did make love to 
this employment!
    They are not near my conscience; their defeat
    Does by their own insinuati
on grow.
    'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
    Between the pass and fell incensed poi
nts
    Of mighty opposites.
  Hor. Why, what a king is this!
  Ham. Does it not, thinks't thee, 
stand me now upon-
    He that hath kill'd my king, and whor'd my mother;
    Popp'd in between th
' election and my hopes;
    Thrown out his angle for my proper life,
    And with such coz'nage- 
is't not perfect conscience
    To quit him with this arm? And is't not to be damn'd
    To let th
is canker of our nature come
    In further evil?
  Hor. It must be shortly known to him from Engl
and
    What is the issue of the business there.
  Ham. It will be short; the interim is mine,
  
  And a man's life is no more than to say 'one.'
    But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
    That t
o Laertes I forgot myself,
    For by the image of my cause I see
    The portraiture of his. I'll
 court his favours.
    But sure the bravery of his grief did put me
    Into a tow'ring passion.

  Hor. Peace! Who comes here?

                 Enter young Osric, a courtier.

  Osr. Your lor
dship is right welcome back to Denmark.
  Ham. I humbly thank you, sir. [Aside to Horatio] Dost kno
w this
    waterfly?
  Hor. [aside to Hamlet] No, my good lord.
  Ham. [aside to Horatio] Thy sta
te is the more gracious; for
'tis a
    vice to know him. He hath much land, and fertile. Let a be
ast
be
    lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at the king's mess.
'Tis
    a chough; but, 
as I say, spacious in the possession of dirt.

  Osr. Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure
, I should
impart
    a thing to you from his Majesty.
  Ham. I will receive it, sir, with all di
ligence of spirit. Put
your
    bonnet to his right use. 'Tis for the head.
  Osr. I thank your l
ordship, it is very hot.
  Ham. No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly.
  Osr. It i
s indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
  Ham. But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my
comp
lexion.
  Osr. Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry, as 'twere- I
cannot
    tell how. But, my
 lord, his Majesty bade me signify to you
that
    he has laid a great wager on your head. Sir, th
is is the
matter-
  Ham. I beseech you remember.
                           [Hamlet moves him to 
put on his hat.]
  Osr. Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here
is
    newly c
ome to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute
gentleman,
    full of most excellent differences, o
f very soft society and
    great showing. Indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the
card
    
or calendar of gentry; for you shall find in him the
continent of
    what part a gentleman would 
see.
  Ham. Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you; though, I

    know, to divide him i
nventorially would dozy th' arithmetic
of
    memory, and yet but yaw neither in respect of his qu
ick sail.
    But, in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of
great
    article, and 
his infusion of such dearth and rareness as, to
make
    true diction of him, his semblable is his
 mirror, and who
else
    would trace him, his umbrage, nothing more.
  Osr. Your lordship speaks
 most infallibly of him.
  Ham. The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our
more
  
  rawer breath?
  Osr. Sir?
  Hor [aside to Hamlet] Is't not possible to understand in
another
 
   tongue? You will do't, sir, really.
  Ham. What imports the nomination of this gentleman?
  Osr
. Of Laertes?
  Hor. [aside] His purse is empty already. All's golden words are
    spent.
  Ham.
 Of him, sir.
  Osr. I know you are not ignorant-
  Ham. I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if y
ou did, it would
not
    much approve me. Well, sir?
  Osr. You are not ignorant of what excellen
ce Laertes is-
  Ham. I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in
    excellence; b
ut to know a man well were to know himself.
  Osr. I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputati
on laid on
him
    by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.
  Ham. What's his weapon?
  Osr. Rapier
 and dagger.
  Ham. That's two of his weapons- but well.
  Osr. The King, sir, hath wager'd with h
im six Barbary horses;
    against the which he has impon'd, as I take it, six French
    rapiers 
and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers,
and
    so. Three of the carriages, in faith
, are very dear to fancy,
    very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of
    ve
ry liberal conceit.
  Ham. What call you the carriages?
  Hor. [aside to Hamlet] I knew you must b
e edified by the
margent
    ere you had done.
  Osr. The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
  Ham
. The phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could
    carry cannon by our sides. I would
 it might be hangers till
then.
    But on! Six Barbary horses against six French swords, their
 
   assigns, and three liberal-conceited carriages: that's the
French
    bet against the Danish. W
hy is this all impon'd, as you call
it?
  Osr. The King, sir, hath laid that, in a dozen passes be
tween
    yourself and him, he shall not exceed you three hits; he hath
    laid on twelve for nin
e, and it would come to immediate trial
    if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.
  Ham. Ho
w if I answer no?
  Osr. I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
  Ham. Sir, I wi
ll walk here in the hall. If it please his
Majesty,
    it is the breathing time of day with me. L
et the foils be
    brought, the gentleman willing, and the King hold his
purpose,
    I will win
 for him if I can; if not, I will gain nothing but
my
    shame and the odd hits.
  Osr. Shall I 
redeliver you e'en so?
  Ham. To this effect, sir, after what flourish your nature will.
  Osr. I 
commend my duty to your lordship.
  Ham. Yours, yours. [Exit Osric.] He does well to commend it
  
  himself; there are no tongues else for's turn.
  Hor. This lapwing runs away with the shell on hi
s head.
  Ham. He did comply with his dug before he suck'd it. Thus has
he,
    and many more of 
the same bevy that I know the drossy age
dotes
    on, only got the tune of the time and outward h
abit of
encounter-
    a kind of yesty collection, which carries them through and
    through the
 most fann'd and winnowed opinions; and do but
blow
    them to their trial-the bubbles are out,


                            Enter a Lord.

  Lord. My lord, his Majesty commended him to you by 
young Osric,
who
    brings back to him, that you attend him in the hall. He sends
to
    know i
f your pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you
will
    take longer time.
  Ham. I am con
stant to my purposes; they follow the King's
pleasure.
    If his fitness speaks, mine is ready; n
ow or whensoever,
provided
    I be so able as now.
  Lord. The King and Queen and all are coming
 down.
  Ham. In happy time.
  Lord. The Queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to
  
  Laertes before you fall to play.
  Ham. She well instructs me.
                                 
                   [Exit Lord.]
  Hor. You will lose this wager, my lord.
  Ham. I do not think so
. Since he went into France I have been
in
    continual practice. I shall win at the odds. But th
ou wouldst
not
    think how ill all's here about my heart. But it is no matter.
  Hor. Nay, good
 my lord -
  Ham. It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gaingiving as
    would perhaps trou
ble a woman.
  Hor. If your mind dislike anything, obey it. I will forestall
their
    repair hit
her and say you are not fit.
  Ham. Not a whit, we defy augury; there's a special providence
in
 
   the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not to come; if it
be
    not to come, it will be now
; if it be not now, yet it will
come:
    the readiness is all. Since no man knows aught of what h
e
leaves,
    what is't to leave betimes? Let be.

    Enter King, Queen, Laertes, Osric, and Lo
rds, with other
              Attendants with foils and gauntlets.
               A table and flag
ons of wine on it.

  King. Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
                    [
The King puts Laertes' hand into Hamlet's.]
  Ham. Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong;

    But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.
    This presence knows,
    And you must needs have h
eard, how I am punish'd
    With sore distraction. What I have done
    That might your nature, ho
nour, and exception
    Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
    Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laert
es? Never Hamlet.
    If Hamlet from himself be taken away,
    And when he's not himself does wro
ng Laertes,
    Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
    Who does it, then? His madness. If'
t be so,
    Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
    His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
  
  Sir, in this audience,
    Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd evil
    Free me so far in your mo
st generous thoughts
    That I have shot my arrow o'er the house
    And hurt my brother.
  Laer
. I am satisfied in nature,
    Whose motive in this case should stir me most
    To my revenge. B
ut in my terms of honour
    I stand aloof, and will no reconcilement
    Till by some elder maste
rs of known honour
    I have a voice and precedent of peace
    To keep my name ungor'd. But till
 that time
    I do receive your offer'd love like love,
    And will not wrong it.
  Ham. I embr
ace it freely,
    And will this brother's wager frankly play.
    Give us the foils. Come on.
  
Laer. Come, one for me.
  Ham. I'll be your foil, Laertes. In mine ignorance
    Your skill shall,
 like a star i' th' darkest night,
    Stick fiery off indeed.
  Laer. You mock me, sir.
  Ham. N
o, by this hand.
  King. Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
    You know the wager?

  Ham. Very well, my lord.
    Your Grace has laid the odds o' th' weaker side.
  King. I do not 
fear it, I have seen you both;
    But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.
  Laer. This 
is too heavy; let me see another.
  Ham. This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
      
                                          Prepare to play.
  Osr. Ay, my good lord.
  King. Set me
 the stoups of wine upon that table.
    If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
    Or quit in an
swer of the third exchange,
    Let all the battlements their ordnance fire;
    The King shall dr
ink to Hamlet's better breath,
    And in the cup an union shall he throw
    Richer than that whi
ch four successive kings
    In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;
    And let the kettl
e to the trumpet speak,
    The trumpet to the cannoneer without,
    The cannons to the heavens, 
the heaven to earth,
    'Now the King drinks to Hamlet.' Come, begin.
    And you the judges, bea
r a wary eye.
  Ham. Come on, sir.
  Laer. Come, my lord.                                They play
.
  Ham. One.
  Laer. No.
  Ham. Judgment!
  Osr. A hit, a very palpable hit.
  Laer. Well, aga
in!
  King. Stay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
    Here's to thy health.
         
      [Drum; trumpets sound; a piece goes off [within].
    Give him the cup.
  Ham. I'll play thi
s bout first; set it by awhile.
    Come. (They play.) Another hit. What say you?
  Laer. A touch,
 a touch; I do confess't.
  King. Our son shall win.
  Queen. He's fat, and scant of breath.
    
Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows.
    The Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
  Ham.
 Good madam!
  King. Gertrude, do not drink.
  Queen. I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.      
    Drinks.
  King. [aside] It is the poison'd cup; it is too late.
  Ham. I dare not drink yet, m
adam; by-and-by.
  Queen. Come, let me wipe thy face.
  Laer. My lord, I'll hit him now.
  King. 
I do not think't.
  Laer. [aside] And yet it is almost against my conscience.
  Ham. Come for the 
third, Laertes! You but dally.
    Pray you pass with your best violence;
    I am afeard you make
 a wanton of me.
  Laer. Say you so? Come on.                               Play.
  Osr. Nothing n
either way.
  Laer. Have at you now!
                [Laertes wounds Hamlet; then] in scuffling, t
hey
                    change rapiers, [and Hamlet wounds Laertes].
  King. Part them! They are i
ncens'd.
  Ham. Nay come! again!                         The Queen falls.

  Osr. Look to the Que
en there, ho!
  Hor. They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?
  Osr. How is't, Laertes?
  La
er. Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric.
    I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.

  Ham. How does the Queen?
  King. She sounds to see them bleed.
  Queen. No, no! the drink, the 
drink! O my dear Hamlet!
    The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.                 [Dies.]
  Ham. O
 villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd.
    Treachery! Seek it out.
                                
                [Laertes falls.]
  Laer. It is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain;
    No medici
ne in the world can do thee good.
    In thee there is not half an hour of life.
    The treachero
us instrument is in thy hand,
    Unbated and envenom'd. The foul practice
    Hath turn'd itself 
on me. Lo, here I lie,
    Never to rise again. Thy mother's poison'd.
    I can no more. The King
, the King's to blame.
  Ham. The point envenom'd too?
    Then, venom, to thy work.              
      Hurts the King.
  All. Treason! treason!
  King. O, yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt.

  Ham. Here, thou incestuous, murd'rous, damned Dane,
    Drink off this potion! Is thy union here?

    Follow my mother.                                 King dies.
  Laer. He is justly serv'd.
  
  It is a poison temper'd by himself.
    Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet.
    Mine and
 my father's death come not upon thee,
    Nor thine on me!                                       D
ies.
  Ham. Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.
    I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, ad
ieu!
    You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
    That are but mutes or audience to this
 act,
    Had I but time (as this fell sergeant, Death,
    Is strict in his arrest) O, I could te
ll you-
    But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;
    Thou liv'st; report me and my cause aright
   
 To the unsatisfied.
  Hor. Never believe it.
    I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.
    Her
e's yet some liquor left.
  Ham. As th'art a man,
    Give me the cup. Let go! By heaven, I'll ha'
t.
    O good Horatio, what a wounded name
    (Things standing thus unknown) shall live behind me
!
    If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,
    Absent thee from felicity awhile,
    And in t
his harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
    To tell my story.         [March afar off, and shot wi
thin.]
    What warlike noise is this?
  Osr. Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
 
   To the ambassadors of England gives
    This warlike volley.
  Ham. O, I die, Horatio!
    The
 potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit.
    I cannot live to hear the news from England,
    But
 I do prophesy th' election lights
    On Fortinbras. He has my dying voice.
    So tell him, with
 th' occurrents, more and less,
    Which have solicited- the rest is silence.             Dies.
 
 Hor. Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince,
    And flights of angels sing thee to th
y rest!
                                                 [March within.]
    Why does the drum com
e hither?

    Enter Fortinbras and English Ambassadors, with Drum,
                  Colours, an
d Attendants.

  Fort. Where is this sight?
  Hor. What is it you will see?
    If aught of woe 
or wonder, cease your search.
  Fort. This quarry cries on havoc. O proud Death,
    What feast is
 toward in thine eternal cell
    That thou so many princes at a shot
    So bloodily hast struck.

  Ambassador. The sight is dismal;
    And our affairs from England come too late.
    The ears 
are senseless that should give us hearing
    To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd
    That Ro
sencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.
    Where should we have our thanks?
  Hor. Not from his mout
h,
    Had it th' ability of life to thank you.
    He never gave commandment for their death.
  
  But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
    You from the Polack wars, and you from England,

    Are here arriv'd, give order that these bodies
    High on a stage be placed to the view;
  
  And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
    How these things came about. So shall you hear
 
   Of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts;
    Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters;
    Of de
aths put on by cunning and forc'd cause;
    And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
    Fall'n on t
h' inventors' heads. All this can I
    Truly deliver.
  Fort. Let us haste to hear it,
    And c
all the noblest to the audience.
    For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.
    I have some rig
hts of memory in this kingdom
    Which now, to claim my vantage doth invite me.
  Hor. Of that I 
shall have also cause to speak,
    And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more.
    But let 
this same be presently perform'd,
    Even while men's minds are wild, lest more mischance
    On 
plots and errors happen.
  Fort. Let four captains
    Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage;
 
   For he was likely, had he been put on,
    To have prov'd most royally; and for his passage
   
 The soldiers' music and the rites of war
    Speak loudly for him.
    Take up the bodies. Such a
 sight as this
    Becomes the field but here shows much amiss.
    Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
 
           Exeunt marching; after the which a peal of ordnance
                                    
               are shot off.

Enter two Sentinels-[first,] Francisco, [who paces up 
and down
at his post; then] Bernardo, [who approaches him].

  Ber. Who's there?
  Fran. Nay, an
swer me. Stand and unfold yourself.
  Ber. Long live the King!
  Fran. Bernardo?
  Ber. He.
  Fr
an. You come most carefully upon your hour.
  Ber. 'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francis
co.
  Fran. For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold,
    And I am sick at heart.
  Ber. Hav
e you had quiet guard?
  Fran. Not a mouse stirring.
  Ber. Well, good night.
    If you do meet 
Horatio and Marcellus,
    The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.

  Fran. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?
  Hor. Friends
